you probably all already know this by now but additional episodes never aired can be viewed on i've watched a lot of television over the years and this is possibly my favorite show ever a crime that this beautifully written and acted show was canceled the actors that played laura whit carlos mae damian anya and omg steven caseman are all incredible and so natural in those roles even the kids are great wonderful show so sad that gone of course i wonder about the reasons it was canceled there is no way i'll let myself believe that ms pregnancy had anything to do with it it was in the perfect time slot in this market i've watched all the episodes again on i hope they all come out on dvd some day thanks for reading
i saw the movie with two grown children although it was not as clever as shrek i thought it was rather good in a movie theatre surrounded by children who were on spring break there was not a sound so i know the children all liked it there parents also seemed engaged the death and apparent death of characters brought about the appropriate gasps and comments hopefully people realize this movie was made for kids as such it was successful although i liked it too personally i liked the scrat
you're using the given some hefty votes to some of your favourite something you enjoy all because of this fifty seconds one world ends another can it not be given a ten i wonder at those who give this a seven or an eight exactly how could the first film ever made be better for the record the long still opening shot is great showmanship a superb innovation perfectly suited to the situation and the dog on the bike is a lovely touch all this within fifty word genius is often is genius
this was a good film with a powerful message of love and redemption i loved the transformation of the brother and the repercussions of the horrible disease on the family well-acted and well-directed if there were any flaws i'd have to say that the story showed the typical suburban family and their difficulties again what about all people of all cultural backgrounds i would love to see a movie where all of these cultures are shown like in real life nevertheless the film soared in terms of its values and its understanding of the how a disease can bring someone closer to his or her maker loved the film and it brought tears to my eyes
aileen gonsalves my girlfriend is in this film playing a secretary at the main bank she has a lovely scene with roshan seth in a restaurant more information on her website at stated my personal interest in the film i have to say that i think it is a beautiful movie moving funny and beautifully filmed
when i rented this movie to watch it i knew that it was not going to be a mindbender movie instead i thought of it as a disbelief of reality where someone is going to get a serious beating and you know what it worked kurt russel did what i though was a remarkable role in showing the emotionless soldier that he was i recommend this movie if your out with the boys and want to watch a good action film
yes this gets the full ten stars plain as day that this fill is genius the universe sent trent harris a young wonderfully strange man one day and harris caught him on tape in all that true misfit glory that you just can't fake too bad it ended in tragedy for the young man if only an alternate ending could be written for that story the other two steps in the trilogy do retell the story with sean penn and crispin glover in the roles of the young men respectively the world is expanded upon and the strangeness is contextualized by the retelling giving us a broader glimpse into growing up weird in vanilla america recommended for anyone and everyone
this is a film that was very well done i had heard mixed reviews while it was in production and have been waiting for its release cheers to the director and all the actors the supporting cast gave eva mendez what she needed to take this to the top as everyone else here states the latter portion of the film is riveting katie cassidy did an amazing job with her character being she had not done a lot of work when this film was made she has quite the career ahead of her i was amazed at her performance i completely enjoyed the film questioned my values in life and priorities and am a better person for it a great message lies within the film release it so all can enjoy
a typical romp through cheech and reality which includes drugs singing more drugs cars and driving even more drugs pee wee aliens gasoline laundry stand up comedy surprisingly more drugs and space coke it is not as coherent or plausible as up in smoke but it still is incredibly funny without becoming as strange as nice dreams there are some classic scenes which include the opening scene where they get some gas for their car and the drive to work also funny is song and follow up song another notable scene is the welfare office scene with jones noise machine from the police academy series and the old laughing man all in all this is a great follow up to up in smoke and is quite watchable when sober or rehab
this film is worth seeing alone for jared harris outstanding portrayal of john lennon it doesn't matter that harris doesn't exactly resemble lennon his mannerisms expressions posture accent and attitude are pure lennon best scene lennon in a local cafe verbally sparring with a stuttering fan as to whether paul mccartney wings silly love songs is worthy of status in america
i was years old when this show was on tv by far it was my favorite the actors were very credible alexandra bastedo was just gorgeous i just order the dvd episodes they didn't have super-powers they just had superior human skills hearing sight the actors were very good in their rolls very believable there was a good story in each episode at the time there were no special effects or explosions everywhere so the script was suppose to be good and the characters performs were great there was no fancy stuff like in other shows they didn't try to make a joke every minutes to make a light show i highly recommend this tv show to anybody that like good stuff
to all the reviewers on this page i would have to say this movie is worth seeing so it was made in so what the fashion in the movie was exactly the same fashion of its time people who didn't study culture of the decades would think that this movie is a cheese ball compared to the modern series behind is made for our time right now it does look cheezy however the only cheezy part of the movie is the fashion which again was over years in the past but the message that is sent in this film is very powerful and carefully preserved there is just so much to say but i refuse to say it fear of spoiling it so go out and see this film if you don't like the message that it sends then you have issues that need some attention
a favourite of movie tells of two feuding new york characters steve and chuck both strive to be the main guy in the bowery in the late nineteenth and real this is a heavily fictionalized account of their on a he do still a cause of from the brooklyn which he became shown here as happening around the same time as the spanish-american walsh clearly had a great affection for the beautifully recreated it includes a wild rumbustious ragtime number from saloon singer trixie young pert is at his slickest as beery shows again what a clever actor he tough big hearted and at times quite touching fay wray is the love interest both the boys are of life and bowery moves at a fast many early is not an easy movie to is well worth looking out for
i thought this movie was lol funny a fun not to be taken seriously movie about one twisted views on life love and well ladies from the lowly bus station skank to the high-class débutante bus station skank tim meadows plays a guy phelps who was raised by in a playboy-style mansion by a hugh hefner-esquire father figure surrounded constantly by beautiful porn models and actresses when his father kicks him out on the street he must learn to fend for himself with nothing but the chauvinistic outlook on life that his youth has taught him that and an unfathomable nearly mystical level of charm and dumb luck and so the hijinx begin if you haven't seen this movie and you enjoy a light-hearted semi-mindless story then i highly recommend renting the ladies man
pierce brosnan the newest but no longer james bond is an assassin he is very very good at what he does but getting old and tired greg kinnair is really good as the straight and narrow business man now when the story opens the movie shows these two people in their separate lives then one night they are having drinks in a bar and they begin to talk then all of a sudden you find these two people getting drawn together during a series of events the story is excellent the acting is top notch and the humor is hilarious i never thought that pierce brosnan would be this funny but he really is and i must say this movie is a must see
one of the most nihilistic and brutal films i've ever seen but also one of the most tragic and moving ones this is an action-melodrama like the world has never seen it before sometimes the plot got me close to tears while in the next moment delivering shocking revelations like a bone-crunching blow to the guts chilling performance by edison chen the story of a hk-cop and a cambodian killer hunting each other down while bit by bit losing their humanity is a strong one featuring very little dialog in favor of haunting imagery and gritty camera-work dog bite dog is pure hk-bloodshed without the heroism
this is a great movie that i don't think gets enough credit as saturday night fever or grease in john career he plays a man who is in love with a girl but is too pig headed to admit his feelings to her instead he wants to engage in mechanical bull riding because he thinks it will show his manhood even though it was made in it is still timely today the great country music soundtrack is terrific
one of the best love stories i have ever seen it is a bit like watching a train wreck in slow motion but lovely nonetheless big edie and little edie seem a bit like family members after watching this movie repeatedly and are infinitely quotable a goddamned beautiful day now will you just shut up the opening explanation of little costume only promises that the movie will live on forever and so will big edie the world famous singer and little edie the world famous dancer
mesmerizing breathtaking and horrifying this hauntingly beautiful film is the apocalypse now without fiction slow in pace quiet in mood it gives good glimpses of the poisoned patches of earth that may well be signs of an inevitable is no doubt in my mind the nature is plagued and we are the disease greed the very essence of humanity that drives evolution and progress has turned us into something like cancer on its way to consume the host and die with landscapes is quite an unforgettable viewing experience at least i'll never regard my toaster and iron the same way again
i have to say that this miniseries was the best interpretation of the beloved novel jane eyre both dalton and clarke are very believable as rochester and jane i've seen other versions but none compare to this one the best one for me i could never imagine anyone else playing these characters ever again the last time i saw this one was in when i was only at that time i was a bookworm and i had just read charlotte novel i was completely enchanted by this miniseries and i remember not missing any of the episodes i'd like to see it again because so good
henri film may be not so famous as parallax view days of the condor or jfk but it is certainly not worse and sometimes even better than these classic representatives of the genre action takes place in fictional western state where fictional president has been killed after several years of investigation special government commission decides that president was killed by a lone gunman but one man prosecutor volney played by yves montand thinks something more to be investigated and so the film starts this movie doesn't deal with some exact theories but it embraces the whole structure of relationship between government and society in world such film could be made only in the but it will never lose actuality furthermore even a bit frightful how precise are oracles out of
did you ever wonder how far one movie could go relentlessly explores the world of the extreme with harry russo is an aggravated writer killer and drug addict scumbag who will stop at nothing to destroy those who stand between him and insanity driven by the demonic voices of his ventriloquist dummy rubberneck harry begins his killing spree director ron atkins comes the installment of the vilest story ever to be only other movie i have seen similar to this would happen to be the installment entitled schizophreniac is a really low budget film and will not be for everyone but if you are looking for something disturbing different and horrific then this would make a fine not expect anything like modern day horror as discretion is advised
as a long-standing barbra fan any posting like this will be biased that aside this film ranks as a classic it has flaws in other postings but gives a glimpse of a time that will never be there again and is fascinating to watch unfold on fought hard to make this movie her own i don't think she was ever satisfied but it gives her fans a new barbra the time with live singing a young fresh appearance and some very heavy-duty story is rough but exciting and holds your interest throughout the extended one frame finale is hard for most non-barbra fans to sit through but it speaks volumes to those who admire her
i happen to run into this movie one night so i decided to watch it i was very pleased with the movie i thought it was a wonderful plot a great feeling knowing a deceased one has come back and you get that second chance to say what you want to say and this wife stayed devoted for years i thought it was a great movie
i saw this film a while back and still at the top of my favorite movies list it is amazingly put together and what really makes the film are the detailed tid bits as the cafe bustelo coffee crate being reused as a cup to wash her grandsons hair that people aren't seeing because you will not understand this movie unless you are hispanic this is just one of those films that is very culturally specific and particular please do not bash this film if you have no prior knowledge of what foundation being built upon i completely see what the was going for and he hit the target perfectly this film is highly deserving of a better rating
i work with children from years old and they all love the doodlebops the doodlebops are energetic vibrant and appealing once they start singing we're the doodlebops we're the doodlebops we're the doodlebops oh yeah come and join the fun because we're laughing and we're singing all day it is almost impossible not to join them in song the doodlebops brings the viewer into a world of color and fun each show is an adventure the doodlebops do not try to change the world with preachy messages all they do is have fun while sorting out everyday life challenges that the young child may relate to the doodlebops is an refreshing high action alternative to regular television programs
forbidden planet is the best sf film from the golden age of sf cinema and what makes it a great film is its sense of wonder as soon as the spaceship lands the audience via the ships human crew travels through an intelligent and sometimes terrifying adventure we meet the unforgetable robbie the mysterious dr morbuis his beautiful and innocent daughter altair and we learn about the former inhabitants of the planet the krell who died out overnight or did they can nitpick and say the planet is obviously filmed in a movie studio with painted backdrops but that adds to a sense of menace of claustraphobia i feel and bebe and louis electronic music adds even more atmosphere shocked this film in the top imdb films
an excellent documentry i personally remember this growing up in nyc in the early this movie is for anyone that wasn't around during that time shows the one thing the african american gay underclass felt was solely theirs and the love and camadrie you see is real the people are real and sadly few are still alive as this is being written the balls are still held but not to the extent that they were in the the nineteen eighties that time is gone forever this is a good pre homo thug movie when queens were really proud to be extroverts goodbye to storyville this is another era gone but greatly documented all hail film
caught the tail end of this movie channel surfing through the cable movie channels and was so intrigued i sought out the next really didn't know what to expect after reading the program summary but i came away from this movie feeling quite disturbed and distressed it also gave me as adult who attended high school in the a little better insight into what our kids have to contend with these fact that you don't see the shooting only adds to the chillness of the plot to see both child and adult alike struggle to comprehend and come to terms with the senseless shootings was at times overwhelming and will admit that i shed quite a few tears the whole not a movie that i would seek out to what however i am sure glad i did see it
a great bugs bunny cartoon from the earlier years has bugs as a performer in an window display at a local department store after done for the day the manager comes in to tell him that he'll be transferring soon bugs is happy to oblige into he figures out that the new job is in that taxidermy has to do with stuffing animals animals like say a certain rabbit this causes a battle of wits between the rascally rabbit and his now former employer i found this short to be delightful and definitely one of the better ones of the early it still remains as funny nearly years later this animated short can be seen on disc of the looney tunes golden collection volume grade
this is a comedy of morals so occasionally a gentle touch of bitterness occurs but a lightness soften all sarcasm and irony flows till all of a sudden one moment will halt your heart and changes film marvelously written and directed is a gem that shines perfectly with beautiful acting by all jean-louis trintignant is exquisite as usual and romy schneider is a pearl perfect and glowing that is not to be missed a truly wonderful film
this short is a puzzlement words fail me here as this is almost indescribable technically exceptional after more than years visuals are remarkable and even occasionally amazing this is not something you watch if you like things that are mundane or normal'-because it most certainly is not either this be an odd one gang well worth checking out but if things like ren and stimpy make your head hurt you may want to skip this recommended
this is te cartoon that should have won instead of country cousin visually well-done and much more entertaining and memorable worth watching just for the music alone although there are elements that undoubtably will bruise the sensibilities of some these days the cartoon has to be given a bit of perspective over sixty years old and it is after all just a cartoon i'm disabled and if i were as hyper-sensitive as the folks who look at things like this cartoon and take umbrage i would have long since curled up in a fetal position and faded away sometimes you need to lighten up put your head back and float caricatures of celebrities in cartoons were common in the and and were almost never terribly flattering bing crosby reportedly hated it when he was used on more than one occasion
this film seems to be well remembered as the time tom jerry signed a peace treaty things are idyllic for a time but predictably it goes sour probably the most memorable moment was the endless fight involving a pipe a frying pan and a baseball bat that the two plus butch the dog engage in at the beginning and end of the short i enjoyed one a bunch and you should try to catch it on cartoon network
i wasn't sure when i heard about this coming out i was thinking how dumb is disney getting i was wrong i found it to be very good i mean not the lion king but cool to see another side from a certain point it was very funny also it wasn't one of those corny disney sequels were the animation sucks it was just like the lion king animation the only thing that eritated me was the whole movie theater thing through out the movie not to give anything way but you'll know what i am talking about i also fun that it was cool to have most of the cast from the original to return it was a very good movie over all
this movie has a great impressive cast ellen burstyn samantha mathis jodelle was years old when she made this movie ellen burstyn and jodelle ferland have both been nominated for best actress in a tv drama at the up-coming emmy awards in new york peter has been nominated best director tv drama at the emmy awards also april jodelle ferland won best actress in a tv drama at the young artist awards in studio city ca i can see why they have nominations mermaid is a true story during the cridits they have the real family on the set something you don't see often you can find mermaid at all blockbuster video stores do watch be glad you did
house of games has a strong story where obsession and illusion play a big part a psychologist offers to help a patient with his gambling debts and gets caught at the you ever felt fascination for something that was both dangerous and wrong watch what happens if you pursue this urge and go all the way sit on the edge of your chair as tricksters are being tricked and victims turn into perpetrators you're never sure of who is exactly who in this is both a quality and a drawback of the script as the movie ends you feel that the story lacks a bit of consistency but all this is largely compensated by the excellent psychological is definitely one of the best movies about gambling
a very strange and compelling movie about a very awkward and tightly wound man who attempts to navigate his life as a door-to-door the director was able to capture a very unnerving tone that really served the story well original and unsettling while also finding a great deal of humor in the pain that accompanies life there is a sequence at a testing facility that really stood out and made me laugh out loud which is not something i do as frequently as i should one of the more memorable films i've seen in a long while hasn't left my mind and i look forward to future efforts by bronstein fantastic performances all around the simple line i really appreciate it is now iconic to me
enjoyed the movie and efficient confucian crime drama the old order survives the threat posed by a brash young greedy man no doubt representing modern society i thought the final scene was strange and could not understand if we were to believe that big d was being punished for being greedy or it was part of the plan a long i loved the scene and for once in a chinese movie the violence was not a choreographed martial arts fest on thing that always amuses me about hk films is that the main influence the british seem to have had is to introduce yes sir and sorry into the local language and its amusing that long after we have gone they are still there
this movie seems on the surface to be a run of mill kids movie that parents can regretfully watch with their mostly entertained little kids the movie seems and is mostly geared towards children yet it does not stop on this level i watched this movie first as a young child and found it to be funny heartwarming and did not see it again for several years i watched it again recently at age and found it to be almost as funny but just as heartwarming and entertaining this movie is highly underrated and contains many messages of real life this movie is an inspirational quest story that is made for kids yet epic in its own right i recommend this movie to anyone of any age
i would like to comment the series as a great effort the story line although requiring a few improvements was pretty well especially in season season however became more of a freak show and lost original charm season one story line was more interesting a light side to the life at jam pony while a focused serious plot with manticore chasing down the x-series i was looking forward to new seasons in fact i still am i hope the fox guys and da production crew realize that a lot of ppl still wait for da to make a comeback even after yrs of it being cancelled da can make it big if worked on properly and i think a name like james cameron should take on this challenge
one night i stumbled upon this on the satellite station out of curiosity i decided to watch be perfectly honest i wasn't main character is beautiful and her body is shown off would think her talents would be wasted as a executioner but apparently not after watching the whole only real gripe is the acting of the supporting cast particularly the actor who plays its prison guard hank is woeful he ever does is get drunk and make ill attempted passes at his co-guard wanda though fortunately for us the viewer and for hank he gets down and dirty with wanda near the end the music used is pretty tense and creates the perfect atmosphere for the executions this movie is well watching alone for the and very sexy jennifer thomas
i happened upon this film by accident and really enjoyed timothy character is without redeeming qualities and at one point busfield and star meloni ogle women as they pass take on the parade is different from janel maloney is looks very much like tea leone but the major difference here is that janel can actually act some very nice things in this film and well worth your attention when on cable
heartland is a wonderful depiction of what it was really like to live on the frontier the hard work and individual strength that were needed to survive the hardships of the climate and the lack of medical care are blended with the camaraderie and the interdependence of the settlers the drama was especially meaningful because the story is based on the diaries of real people whose descendants still live there it was also nice to see the west inhabited by real people no one was glamorous or looked as if they had just spent a session with the makeup or costume department conchatta ferrell is just wonderful she is an example of the strong persevering people who came to wyoming in the early century and let no hardship stand in their way of a new life in a new land
i saw the film twice in the space of one week both times the at a cinema in orpington kent uk the place was packed both times and people had to be turned away from the start of the film with henry winkler getting injured on the football field the whole audience was in uproar with laughter laughter that lasted until the those who love american wrestling this film is a must but be ready to see henry winkler as you have never seen him before also look out for a very well known actor whose trademark wrestling move is a you get a chance watch this movie and it is family comedy entertainment at its best
this movie was the best movie i have ever seen being lds i highly recommend this movie because you are able to feel a more understanding about the life of joseph smith although the movie was not made with highly acclaimed actors it is a remarkable and life changing movie that can be enjoyed and appreciated by everyone i saw this movie with my family and i can bear witness that we have all had a change of heart this movie allows people to really understand how hard the life was for the prophet and how much tribulation he was faced with after i saw this was not a single dry eye in the entire room everyone was touched by what they saw and i have not been the same since i have seen it i highly recommend this movie for everyone
beautiful film pure cassavetes style gena rowland gives a stunning performance of a declining actress dealing with success aging alcoholism she tries to escape her own subconscious ghosts embodied by the death spectre of a young girl acceptance of oneself of human condition though its overall difficulties is the real purpose of the film the parallel between the theatrical sequences and the film itself are puzzling like if the stage became a way out for the heroin if all american movies could only be that top-quality dealing with human relations on an adult level not trying to infantilize and standardize feelings one of the best dramas ever
for a movie with a plot like this i would normally smell tearjerker in the first ten minutes and turn it off but this was very well made with emotional subtleties great acting and some genuinely funny moments it was also interesting to see a different culture a vanishing one at that my wife and i both dug it
i love jokes like the cliché is or over the top cliché guy black oily skin kinda spooky he is just hilarious starting to catch up on him to good thing not on the team anymore a way or else it would have been sarcasm just love all the plots a little less i have to admit the characters are great the actors are great i'm starting to pick up facial expressions more from jack daniel and just all theoretically possible and their i go again sorry i'm also starting to pick up traits from carter and all of this is driving my parents nutz well to conclude i think good for another three seasons or so especially if they keep on packing the episodes with all this humor drama action and so forth
this is definitely one of best efforts few actors are able to play the stoic as jet li can the action is rapid-fire and special-effects boosted for intensity purposes as a result it may take americans a little off-guard a little suspension of disbelief goes a long way in a jet li film i feel that it is an excellent introduction to work and look forward to further masterpieces fist of legend making it into the us market a nice mixture of gunplay and physical conflict will satisfy most action flick enthusiasts
this was one of the highlights of semi-forgettable second season before they grew up or grew into their own in the third season and beyond this was not only a showcase for up-and-comers like bill campbell and teri hatcher but was also the continuation of search for his humanity this time through the concept of comedy still one of my favorite a side-note i'm still disappointed that there is no credit for the actress with whose character okona was about to have a teri character before being rudely interrupted by lt worf i remember watching this episode first-run at my friends comic shop back in the day and we all thought she would've been a perfect jean would be nice to know who this pretty lady actually is
i thought this move was very good there were a few things that were less than perfect but overall i was quite surprised the courtroom scene in the end seemed a little unrealistic but was real enough to be entertaining i found that the movie communicated the hardships of going though military training and the sacrifices that go along with it being a military pilot i could relate to many of these parts
what a master piece to take the cold war conflict and transport it to the future this film is satire of the highest order in my humble opinion it outranks dr clever naming of the two superpowers as the confederation and the market cons being commies and market the west outstanding the clever use of gen joxs was ahead of its time only are we really seeing the dangers of genetic engineering robot joxs tackled the issue head on in message of this film is about the comradeship of the humble man and how it can overcome the wishes of government this movies screams don't do it you fools you'll kill us
the wonderfully urbane ronald coleman is show-cased here as in few other of his films he is literally in every scene and this comical movie remains fresh because of him not in spite of him he is handsome witty and very clever here as he remains a step ahead of his wandering lovely perfectly by anna lee the movie is based on a french play and brings all the best qualities of that farce most of the supporting cast is well known at least by face if not are absolutely perfect for this very funny film the fantastic mr coleman is a combination of sean connery and clark gable as he stays a step ahead of the other characters his multi-talents can be further appreciated in the classic lost horizon which every film buff must see
both visually and musically stunning a treat for both the eye and the ear the quintessential victorian element of the opening sequences were completely enchanting helping to create a christmas scene of which dickens himself would have been justifiably proud technically the production is visually stimulating and the special effects are both imaginatively devised and creatively achieved in a traditional stage setting the dancing of many of the lead artistes is breathtakingly good the photography and lighting are first class and the sound recording admirably matches the overall high level of technical skills employed a great film for all the family at christmas time and a most delightful discovery which will withstand multiple viewing
those who love elivra as i did in her late night movie hostess duties will love this movie she is just plain cool her car is great and she is a bit of a transylvanian dolly parton she is so innocent and naive at times and sexy all of the time plus more than a touch of mae west sets are well done as well and the comic cast is great with edie mcclurg at her usual best plus sally kellerman as patty is hilarious any time i have to crunch something for a topping i will think of how elvira crunches the potato chips movie is one to be watched again and again just for the fun of it now i have to get the sequel to it haunted hills and see if it lives up to this one
holes was a great movie disney made the right choice every person who i have talked to about it said they loved it everyone casted was fit for the part they had and shia labeouf really has a future with acting sigourney weaver was perfect for the warden she was exactly how i imagined her everyone who hasn't seen it i recommend it and i guarantee you will dig it
dominion tank police is without a shell of a doubt one of the most amazing shows ever produced but not just in the field of animation while the first part and mostly consists of action and fun the second part is more serious and one should not treat the second part in the exact same way as first part the subtleties are truly out of this world and the characterization is beyond brilliant you must have an extra degree of intelligence to appreciate the intricacies of the second part and i do have some complaints though in the first part the tank bonaparte quite literally jumps over a tank shell and it did not make any sense at all one might also question the plausibility of bonaparte jumping on the wing of helicopter gunship even though it was cool buaku rules
even if you know absolutely nothing about ireland you have to love my left foot especially daniel day-lewis performance in it he plays cerebral palsy-afflicted christy brown due to this he has spent most of his life ostracized even when trying to warn people about something they just laugh at him the light in the darkness for him is that he has control over one body part his left foot he uses that appendage to paint and write poetry bringing him to day-lewis and director jim sheridan did very well on this collaboration and also on a later collaboration in the name of the father the boxer was unnecessary my left foot can make you feel many ways sad hopeful or something else but in any case daniel day-lewis gave the performance of a lifetime here a great movie in every sense
james stewart and margaret sullavan play co-workers in a budapest gift shop who don't really like each other not knowing they're really sweetheart pen pals who have yet to very charming romantic comedy very engagingly played by two likable stars and a very eager-to-please supporting cast the story is well written and the film has that romantic innocence quite know how to explain it that films today just don't have this can obviously be compared to the recent you've got mail and the original wins in every is mandatory viewing each christmas i can't think of a better way to jumpstart a christmas feel than this little gem
robin williams and kurt russell play guys in their who put their marraiges in jeopardy by deciding somewhat reluctantly to replay their heartbreaking tie with rival bakersfield years after the fact williams is ok but russell is flat-out great as legendary taft quarterback remo hightower holly palance does a nice and attractive turn as williams wife who could live without this rematch film is worth watching just to see the famed remo in action highly recommended
it even beats the nasty raw almost twenty years old is this show and still i laughed very much when i was watching it last night it shows eddie murphy dressed in tight red he jokes with everything from celebertis to his family he was only old then and this is a
i was surprised at how a movie could be both cheesy and excellent at the same time the frisbee flying saucer was naff beyond comprehension especially when landing yet the specially effects when the krell attacked were awesome for a film that was made over half a century ago living in the middle east i saw shades of islam creep in when jj adams suggested alta should dress more modestly and as an engineer was amazed by the imagination used for the futuristic gadgets and gizmos dreamed up by the props department all in all an entertaining hour and a half my first time seeing walter pidgeon and a chance to see leslie neilsen as a young man
this is a very dramatic and suspenseful movie there are many plots and turns the story or the director opens question marks on the death row or presumed crimes committed by black people this film is very well directed by arne glimcher and the fine sound of james newton howard is excellent strong performance of sean connery and ed harris if you liked this one miss true crimes or the hurricane my wife and me gave
i gave it an star rating the story may have fallen short about of the way into the picture but the performances remained strong of honor was changed from navy diver understandably so anyone who has served in any branch of the armed forces will probably feel that honor is an appropriate word to use in the title
one word can describe this movie and that is weird i recorded this movie one day because it was a japanese animation and it was old so i thought it would be interesting well it was the movie is about a young boy who travels the universe to get a metal body so he can seek revenge on the way he meets very colorful characters and must ultimately decide if he wants the body or not very strange if you are a fan of you might want to check this out
religious bigotry is rampant everywhere australia is not immune to dingo snatched a baby and the mother was tried and sent to prison for having killed her own baby i don't mean to spoil the story for you but you need to know the basics before getting knee-deep in what caused this woman to find herself inside a or rent the movie and discover how deep-seated human hatred of those who are different continues to thrive around the is a very moving motion picture with a terrific cast of meryl streep her famous aussie accent and sam neill whose accent is his native-born pronunciation are outstanding those with supporting roles are also quite will remember this movie for many it
clock is a gripping a cross between a virus movie and a disaster film this movie which aired in two parts on nbc in its debut showing in is about an airplane flight that becomes infected with a virus when one of the passengers just happens to be carrying this disease the government debates on whether the plane should be destroyed or not while the pilot dean anderson and a virus expert zuniga try to figure something out to avoid disaster i'm not really a big fan of tv movies and miniseries but i liked clock one heck of a thrill ride jane leeves frasier robert loggia and edward herrmann the president also of four
in iran women are not admitted to soccer games officially because they are to be spared from the vulgar language and behavior of the male audience but of course it is about sexism women are lower forms of human brave girls oppose this and try to get into the stadium by using different tricks they are caught by soldiers and hold in a kind of cage until the police will come and pick them the insane situation this is a film with lots of humor also encouraging to see how people always find different ways of fighting oppression you'll get touched at the same time as you have lots of laughs good job by director jafar panahi this is in many ways a heroic comedy
really the tale of two cocky brothers and their respective falls from grace drug addiction and later redemption one brother a self-proclaimed genius played by james franco is your typical sensitive but intelligent man-child the other brother is a hard-working future doctor who becomes less judgmental as he himself falls prey to addiction while dealing with the stress of living up to his expectations for both children not too heavy handed as drug fables are want to be and all in all a pretty realistic sketch of the family dynamics that drug problems bring about i'd recommend it to anyone interested in such character studies and commend james franco for his efforts in what was obviously a labor of love
wow i forgot how great this movie was until i stumbled upon it while looking through the garage a kind of strange combination of a bio of michael jackson a collection of musical vignettes and a story about a super hero fighting to save some little kids the vignettes are good speed demon but the best part of this movie is the super hero segment in which michael jackson turns into a car a robot and finally a spaceship just as weird as it sounds joe pesci is hilarious and has enough cool imagery and great music to entertain real gem however is the incredible smooth criminal video which makes the movie worth owning for that part alone
this movie was highly entertaining the soundtrack adams is simply beautiful and inspiring even more impressive is brian adams doing all the songs in french as well the score is also uplifting and movie is made from a mix of traditional animation combined with computer generated images the result is truly stunning i watch this film at least once a week with my kids and we never tire of it the story is compelling and well don't understand anyone who would rank this movie less than a definately a keeper in my household
this film isn't just about a school shooting in fact its never even seen but that just adds to the power this film has its about people and how they deal with tragedy i know it was shown to the students who survived the columbine shooting and it provided a sense of closure for a lot of them the acting is superb all three main actors phillips erika christensen and victor garber are excellent in their highly recommend this film to anyone its one of those films that makes you talk about it after you see it it provokes discussion of not only school shootings but of human emotions and reactions to all forms of tragedy it is a tear-jerker but it is well worth it and one i will watch time and time again
this is a very moving picture about forty-something best friends in a small england town one finds a passionate loves and a new beginning with a younger piano instructor when tragedy strikes and hearts are changed forever definitely a film to have a box of tissues with you a powerful piece of work this is definitely one of my favorite films of all spoiler alert main character is taken by her young handsome piano instructor and a passionate romance blossoms her two jealous friends play an immature prank which quickly leads to tragedy she loses her love and her friends in one foul swoop in the end a unexpected surprise pulls them back my opinion her forgiveness is not warranted
i liked this film a lot dark not a bullet-dodging car-chasing numb your brain action movie a lot of the characters backgrounds and motivations are kinda vague leaving the viewer to come to their own conclusions nice to see a movie where the director allows the viewer to make up their own the end motivated by love or vengeance or a desire to repent he does what he feels is right will god ever forgive us for what we've done not a question mortal men can answer so he does what he feels he has to do what good at what been trained to washington is a great actor i honestly can't think of one bad movie done and got a great supporting cast i would thoroughly recommend this movie to anyone
this film has a special place in my heart as when i caught it the first time i was teaching adult literacy it rang very true to me and even an outstanding student i had at the time there are scenes which make you gulp with sudden emotion and those which even put a smile on your face through sheer identification with the characters and their situation performances by jane fonda and robert deniro that rank with their best work a great turn by a young martha plimpton an inspiring story line and a haunting musical score makes for a most enjoyable and rewarding experience
saw this movie on its release and have treasured it since what a wonderful group of actors always find the casting one of the most interesting aspects of a film really enjoyed seeing dramatic actress jacqueline bisset in this role and wallace shawn is always a hoot the script is smart sly and tongue-in-cheek poking fun at almost everything beverley hills loved paul doctor and ray manservant this was raunchy and crude but thank god unless you're a prude i heartily recommend this movie fyi for anyone who likes to play six degrees of kevin bacon mary woronov paul bartel were in rock roll high school mary woronov and robert beltran were in night of the comet together they were all three in eating raoul
i enjoyed this after watching made me wonder just how many caitlin exist in the many other girls have been subjected to this sort of sexual torment by classmates and have been too frightened to open their mouth about it just how threatening and cruel can teenagers be towards one as this film right is not foremost who is feared which manipulates the minds of influences them to allow this sort of immorality to amber thiessen gives a powerful performance as the rape brian austin green is convincing as the guy torn between the girl he thought he his best is the kind of film that doesn't get the exposure it good to be just a film made for tv
first things first this isn't an action movie although there is a lot of action in it i think you can compare it to american sports movies where a team of very bad players succeed in the a game or tournament beyond expectation in this case it isn't about football or taekwondo in the beginning these street thugs seem to be good for nothing but soon we will find out that they don't want to be thugs and actually achieve something in life it is nice to see them struggle and training i was surprised how funny this movie was from start till the end you will laugh your pants off the young korean actors are very convincing go see this wonderful feel good movie
i saw this film with a special screening of the work of owen alik shahadah it is so interesting where did this guy come from now he is probably the key independent african filmmaker in the world and i am not talking about black filmmakers i am talking about filmmakers who are rooted in culture the idea if anything testifies to the diversity and range of african themes with his film years later it is a african issue but the idea doesn't fit that mold showing the artistic diversity the film is an all african cast but the topic is a human topic which most of us could relate to i just love the mild comedy in it and the kora of tunde jegede is just amazing it is really a art-house gem
i read all of nancy drew as a preteen and collect the books as a grown-up i loved the effect used at the end a little bit at the beginning of the movie where line drawings in the style of the books morphed into scenes from the movie it was a neat way of pointing out connections between situations in the movie and the books for example the scenes with the oriental antiques dealer were very reminiscent of many scenarios i remember from the books i thought ned was perfectly cast and emma roberts was a wonderful century interpretation of nancy drew like the picture of betty crocker she keeps up with the times
this would have worked a lot better if it had been made as mitchell in malta at least then we would have been spared the sight of joe don baker running around an otherwise scenic mediterranean locale clad in that ridiculous looking cowboy to mention acting like an old west gunslinger mitchell being mitchell the film wouldn't have suffered from a lack of gratuitous police brutality either oh well at least the comic comments of mike and the bots made this enjoyable fare as an episode of mst i can't imagine watching it on own however
i have complained to abc about the cancellation of six degrees if enough people do the same then it could be enough to bring this fabulous show back to life just go onto the official site and the rest is simple enough i do not understand why this show has been cancelled what a fantastic show cast and characters the whole concept is gripping viewing i am astounded that my favourite show is over after just one series why is this six degrees is phenomenal better than so many other tv programmes out there until i heard they were stopping it from a friend it hadn't even occurred to me that this might happen
hardcastle and mccormick is an excellent tv show it is predictable much like the dukes of hazzard hunter the a-team etc etc show is just good clean television the relationship between hardcastle and mccormick is quite amusing they often take jabs at each other several times an episode which adds a great deal of humor to the show it contains several car chases in almost every episode but who doesn't enjoy a good car chase especially with the coyote only wish they made clean television like this today i highly recommend this
lavish production values and solid performances in this straightforward adaption of jane satirical classic about the marriage game within and between the classes in provincial century england northam and paltrow are a salutory mixture as friends who must pass through jealousies and lies to discover that they love each other good humor is a sustaining virtue which goes a long way towards explaining the accessability of the aged source material has been toned down a bit in its harsh scepticism i liked the look of the film and how shots were set up and i thought it didn't rely too much on successions of head shots like most other films of the and do very good results
maybe the greatest film ever about is opening shot continues to haunt my of course is wonderful and out of this jones is always a delight the sound of jazz as you can find the music available on lovers of jazz and film noir should study this tremendous shadows and light what music what a hat
i saw this movie once in or close to its release year years ago although i can now only remember bits of it i long to see it again the parts i remember rightly or wrongly include mustard gas in the trenches and suzie kendall as a german spy offering some bloke sexual favours in the back of an enclosed truck to get military information from him the music score was especially memorable and emotion stirring in the league of gone with the wind and i would love to hear it again there must be some commercial or copyright reason why this movie is not available anyone know why i doubt its anything to do with a lack of quality or interest
elisha cuthbert plays sue a fourteen year old girl who has lost her mother and finds it hard to communicate with her father until one day in the basement of her apartment she finds a secret magic elevator which takes her to back to the late century were she meets two other children who have lost their father and face was clicking through the channels and found read the synopsis and suddenly saw elisha thought watched the movie i didn't realise elisha had done films girl next door and elisha provides a satisfactory performance the plot is a little cheesy but the film amazing how this young girl went on to become the hottest babe in hollywood
this film is one of those that has a resounding familiarity to it it is earthy grounded and a film that will make you smile paul reiser and peter falk take you on a journey that you will not forget the soundtrack is beautifully varied and fitting and the film itself is like a breath of fresh air this surely deserves recognition for both the film and the actors finally a piece of art that departs from the obvious love story and the frequent special affects that are seen today never have i walked out from a movie with such deep warmth and feeling of thoughtfulness in my heart for it felt as if someone had just wrapped it in a fluffy fleece blanket to see this film is to find a real treasure and delight in it
this was a great movie with a good story my children and all loved this movie including myself the music was also fantastic no the horses do not talk but instead the story is told by spirit and to hear a story told by a point if view was think the title says it all spirit this movie really gives you a sense of family and home and friends i would have to say my year old boy and year old girl were really touched by this movie and even got so into it they laughed so hard and they cheered for spirit in the end spirit with your family and have your spirit lifted with this heartwarming story your kids will love it i think you will too
the lion king is without a doubt my favorite disney movie of all time so i figured maybe i should give the sequels a chance and i did lion king was pretty good and had good laughs and fun with timon and pumba only problem i feel sometimes no explanations are needed because they can create plot holes and just the feeling of wanting your own explanation well i would highly recommend this movie for lion king fans or just a night with the family a fun flick with the same laughs and lovable characters as the first so hopefully i'll get the same with the third installment to the lion king series sit back and just think hakuna matata it means no worries
cry freedom is a movie about how far people will go to find the first half is an interesting portrayal of an unlikely friendship between activist steve biko and editor don woods fanatically by dezel washington and kevin klein while the second half deals with woods looking for answers on most people favor the first half of the movie which focuses on the unlikely friendship between biko and woods i found the second half about don woods struggle to have story be heard around the world much more interesting
i really thought they did an job there was nothing wrong with it at all i don't know how the first commenter could have said it was terrible it moved me to tears guess it moved about everyone to tears but i try not to cry in a movie because embarrassing but this one got me it was sooo good i hope they release it on dvd because i will definitely buy a copy i feel like it renewed my faith and gave me a hope that i can't explain it made me want to strive to be a better person they went through so much and we kind of take that for granted i guess compared to that i feel like our own trials are nothing well not nothing but they hardly match what they had to go through i loved it who played emma
spoiler saw this film a few years back its a lovely story about a young fella who wants to drink his mothers milk at the breast but she thinks he is to old for it he ends up lusting after another ladies breasts and ends up in competition with his brother who fancies her throw in a jealous husband of this woman who cannot get aroused and you have a cheeky yet warm story about love friendship and lovely pairs of jugs be put off by sub-tit-les hehe
i loved this mini series tara fitzgerald did an incredible job portraying helen graham a beautiful young woman hiding along with her young son from a mysterious past as an anglophile who loves romances this movie was just my cup of tea and i would recommend it to anyone looking to escape for a few hours into the england of the i also must mention that toby stephens who portrays the very magnetic gilbert markham is reason enough to watch this wonderful production
not really a big box office draw but i was pleasently this movie james i did some things to farrah fawcett orr and directed this movie about an ordinary average larry burrows who thinks his life would have different if he hit a homerun at a key baseball he was but thanks to mysterious and magical larry gets his wish yet soon realizes that his new exactly as he hoped it would must say this movie really impressed me critics have mixed and i must say the concept is really interesting off well yes it is a little standard but packs moments drama and excellent acting to make it james belushi think was oscar worthy for his role is perfect and linda hamilton plus renee russo shine roles michael caine is perfect as the bartender a good movie with a good lesson if you've never seen recommend you check
i watched fido on some movie channel and i have to say that i've become an instant fan the film feels like a comic book that perfectly captures the look and feel of the surreal you know the wholesome decade when they danced to elvis while dropping nuclear bombs in the desert just for the heck of it people were so naive back then that frightening and the idea that those clean cut folks would find it normal to have zombies as pets actually works to this canadian production the colorful crisp cinematography and the excellent cast including carrie anne moss billy connolly henry czerny and the a shame this film wasn't a bigger hit it deserved more recognition much better than the stuff from tim burton or the shaun of the dead team oh well an instant classic nonetheless
this movie captures the essence of growing up in smalltown america for a young girl on her own the realism and subtle nuances offered to ashley character ruby by the storyline capture what can only be described as a true to life setting in the panhandle of florida from the slam of a screen door to the lack of work the echoes of what life is really like on the red-neck riviera provide rough choices for the young girl paradise did not come easy but she slowly overcomes obstacles and deceit and learns to be her own woman with a strength that flows from within ashley winning smile and infectious gait exude warmth and command respect and admiration the careful pace of the character development resembles that of gold in starring peter fonda and also directed by victor nunez
personnaly i really loved this movie and it particularly moved me the two main actors are giving us such great performances that at the end it is really heart breaking to know what finally happened to their alchemy between barbra streisand and kris kristofferson is marvelous and the song are just great the way they are why i didn't feel surprised when i learned it had won golden globe awards most rewarded movie at the golden globes an oscar and even a grammy this movie is a classic that deserves to be seen by anyone a great movie that has often been criticized because streisand dared to get involved in it surely as a co-director her artistry is the biggest and that will surely please you
this movie is simply was a very sensitive issue and movie was movie did not create any controversy in india far as i know and its publicity was also kept i thought that this movie would simply be a waste of time since most of the indian directors and producers used to change the theme even though its very sensitive and adds a love story in original story and spoils the whole of the indian viewers would agree on this topic if they remember ashoka mangal have been so many movies in india which would have become milestone or mega hits if the love story part would not be unnecessarily its treatment is pretty similar to pinjar movie a must it counts then i would like to thank anil kapoor producer and firoz abbas khan the director for making such a great movie
this is a must see for anybody who loves specially political thriller one scene that stands out is milgram experiment it is shot to perfection very rarely do we get to see a movie shot and scripted the way this movie is movie starts with a kennedy like assassination and a three member team is constituted to investigate the assassination however one of the member does not agree with the final findings of the committee as per the terms set that member would initiate a one man investigation into the assassination this investigation gets him involved in into to deep and dark secrets of high office politics and the way they are controlled
the most important thing about this movie is the brilliant performance by daniel day-lewis and hugh o'conor as christy brown guineas artist and fighter who despite of her physical condition overcame all the odds as a person who did work with patients with cerebral palsy i can assure you that their performance were shockingly convincing the enormous support that christy got form his family low-income working class dubliners encouraged him to do the impossible and this picture depicted this support brilliantly have not read the book but the dialogs were written wisely to capture christy witty arrogant personality i do recommend this movie to everyone especially to classic movie-lovers
i was very surprised with this film i was touched with the lives that paulie touched along his way to find his marie the little girl he was separated from the humor was also very good and it did not hurt the story as i thought it would probably do actually i was expecting paulie wants a cracker jokes to hurt this film but even that was done in a very humorous scene that turns very touching when paulie is in the research lab press room conference so if you wish to see a good animal that talks film check this one out much better than dr dolittle in my opinion paulie also has a surprised twist in the end that is done very nicely as well
this film quite literally has every single action movie cliche and all of them work to its advantage straight from lethal weapon gary busey wisecracks shoots and chuckles through this film with such reckless abandonment it can't help but amuse and entertain there are tanks helicopters machine gun battles grenades and ice cream vans and if they aren't good enough reasons to watch this film then how about the best trejo and if you don't know who danny trejo is then you probably won't like this film
a film that dramatized an understandable reluctance to face the inevitable coming of the the second world war when a spanish republican sent by his soon to be overthrown government boyer infiltrates himself into england looking for support for his cause by trying to influence wealthy mine owners not to sell coal to the fascists back in spain he upsets the locals getting convincingly beaten in one scene and later in the film facing an angry crowd of miners who see him as yet another threat to their shaky livelihood notwithstanding socio-economic hierarchy xenophobia and world politics this film expertly delves into a dark and suspenseful intrigue involving unfaithful compatriots played by katina paxinou and peter lorre and is expertly filmed in numerous darkly lit scenes set in a dreary hotel by james wong howe and manages more than once to get under your skin
dark angel is a cross between brave new world and love in the the not too distant future as a disturbing mixture of chaos and order both in the worst sense of the word once one swallows the premise that all modern technology can be brought to a standstill by the pulse it provides an entertaining landscape for exploring the personalities of and relationships between the two primary dark messenger and logan rich rebel it seems uneven perhaps a result of a variety of authors but is held together by the energetic beautiful and charming jessica alba who seems both strong and calloused yet vulnerable and sensitive i think that fox has done it again
the sexploitation movie era of the late sixties and early seventies began with the allowance of gratuitous nudity in mainstream films and ended with the legalization of hardcore porn peak years were between and one of the most loved and talented actresses of the era was monica gayle who had a small but fanatic cult of followers she was actually able to act unlike many who filled the lead roles of these flicks and her subsequent credits proved it and her seemingly deliberate fade into obscurity right when her career was taking off only heightens her graver the director was also a talent probably too talented for the sexploitation genre and his skill combined with monica screen presence makes sandra the making of a woman a pleasantly enjoyable experience the film never drags and you won't have your finger pressed on the fast-forward button
funny not arthur miller or elliot but man this is funny kline and fields are great toss-off line god you are so disgusting as she climbs in his window great running into the door after scoping out teri hatcher great too robert downey jr and kathy moriarty work together flawlessly until he finds out who she really is a soap opera turn if there every was scene near the end in the chinese dining area had my kids and i rolling on the floor that scene alone is worth the rental solve any world problems or show the seemy underbelly of daytime hope just a lot of fun
sometimes i just want to laugh don't you no analyzing no critiquing and no looking for deeper meaning rent this movie watch it all and laugh your ass off don't want to admit you liked it fine but don't trash it here when you and i both know you liked it damn funny
there isn't a whole lot going on in this story just two men employing very different ways of handling memories of vietnam but what it lacks in premise it more than makes up for in acting and realism a quiet film about the bonds of friendship and shared experience we even get romance gratuitous just another very real piece of this story well worth seeing
first film has all his trademark visual flair and immaculate technique accompanied by compelling performances from massimo girotti as the handsome drifter and best of all clara calamai as the fabulous frantic giovanna remade several times as the postman rings twice but never bettered can't believe this was the first film it shows the confidence of someone at the zenith of their career
so one person says this movie is a beautiful delicate exploration of west german life after world war ii and the other says former nazis living in bombed out buildings and the movie is beautiful delicate and the first sits there nodding takes another sip of coffee i can't explain just see it
this film is wonderful in every way that modern action adventures are not take some time relax enjoy think people who see this movie as slow or plodding or dull really need to take a week off and watch it several times until their short attention span mind comes to grips with the possibility of being involved with a cause or even beautiful story in a beautiful place for no other reason than because it isn't hurrying to make the points you so emphatically need it to make in the short time alloted at first i was apprehensive of brosnan playing a native american given the story line though i think it was apt casting now back to my hermiting
the movie was a long awaited release which where a bit disappointing because of the i had set up when looking at it again i must say it is actually pretty ok first of all is it very true to the original history course not completely and is as such only made to keep the right for the movie history as a child is shown and is very true to the original the acting is perhaps not the best around and the plot is a bit thin but when you compare it to the vitti movie is way better just because it is not trying to be a musical generally would i only recommend it to fans of modesty blaise or to someone who by catch it on the tv
another aussie masterpiece this delves into the world of the unknown and the supernatural and it does very well it doesn't resort to the big special effects overkill like american flicks it focuses more on emotional impact a relatively simple plot that rebecca gibney co bring to life it follows the story of a couple who buy an old house that was supposedly home to a very old woman who never went outside and whose husband disappeared in mysterious circumstances a century ago strange things begin to happen in the house and john adam begins to turn into the man who disappeared who was actually a mass murderer highly recommended
this is comedy as it once was and comparing this with the two remakes the money pit and are we done yet only points out all the more how the movie makers had a flair for comedy which has since regretfully been was when i first saw this and even at that tender age there was much i could laugh at now of course being familiar with adult frustrations i see a whole lot that i missed as a three main grant myrna loy and melvyn perfectly but the core of the movie lies in the frustrations encountered in achieving a dream never as easy and free of unseen complications as one in all this is a classic comedy which still stands above the attempts to remake it
this is movie is very touching i don't care what people say about this movie this is a very good movie the performances by amitabh role has the dying father is great because he wants to teach his son how to handle life in case something happens to him and akshay kumer was great in his role as the spoiled aditya thakur the supporting role of shefali shetty who played the role of sumitra thakur was magnificent priyanka chopra was good in her small role she had in the movie ragpal yadav as the brain-dead servant and boman irani as the show-off father-in law have a very good connection and the comedy were hilarious the direction is very good
i watched the show years ago and loved it am now in possession of the dvd and was watching the series and waiting for scenes i knew were in the show lucas confronts gail in his realized it was missing all of a sudden i was watching the seduction without the lead up then i went on line to check out all the bios of the stars and came across the comments about the shows being out of order thank you but there seems to be some conflict some comments state strangler number then triangle when another had them around the other way and also potato boy and dead to the world were reversed as well can someone clarify
this film has some of the greatest comedic dialog and memorable quotes ever assembled in one film the plot is somewhat lacking but the delightful quips are enough to make up the difference this is a timeless movie for all ages that is sure to please as a cinematic art form it is highly entertaining and with major stars like cary grant myrna loy and melvyn douglas how could you go wrong dialog and timeing such as this has long been undervalued and is very difficult to imitate a good example of this is seen in the knockoff of this film the money pit with tom hanks and shelley long despite the talent and physical comedy of these stars the film dragged and received poor reviews and viewer comments achieving true comedic dialog is an art
stanley and iris show the triumph of the human spirit for stanley the struggle to become literate and realize his potential for iris to find the courage to love again after becoming a widow the beauty of the movie is the dance that robert deniro and jane fonda do together starting and stopping before each has the skills and courage to completely trust each other and move on in that sense it very nicely gives us a good view of how life often is thus being credible unlike some other reviewers i found the characters each rendered to be consistent for the whole picture the supporting cast is also carefully chosen and they add a depth of character that the main characters get added meaning from the supporting performances all in all an excellent movie the best thing i take from it is hope
twelve monkeys is an insane time-travelling action packed movie that stars bruce willis who plays james cole a man who is sent back in time to collect information about the devastating plague that ensues in november of unfortunately he is sent back too far to the year where everyone believes that he is movie is thrilling and has great acting performances from bruce willis brad pitt and madeleine stowe twelve monkeys is one of the greatest time travelling movies that i believe anybody can enjoy terry gilliam has created a true
when i saw this movie a few days ago my eyes were completely fixed to the screen its greatness held my attention to such an extent that i focused all of my attention on it for its entire duration i would recommend seeing it not just to fans of anime but to anyone who likes great movies period who likes really weird stuff the style of art is beautiful the sound is perfect and the symbolism within it is breathtaking i've heard complaints about the weird insertion of english text in the movie but i think the way its done is complementary to the strange style of the movie the self-attributed description of hello kitty on acid doesn't do justice to this film of absolutely epic proportions i'd like to find more works by whoever made this and see them
i had just reached thirteen when i first saw this series and i am watching it again on dvd over thirty years later the pictures over the opening credits have never left me it has affected my view of the world and the peoples in it my parents were with me long enough to have seen the series with me and we always discussed the programme afterwards it gave me a love for studying history and the highest marks i got in our public laurence voice and delivery is timeless and perfect i get the feeling that the people who lived through it would feel that this is their version of the history of the second world war i cannot imagine ever getting bored looking at it maybe an similar cold war series could now be contemplated although who could replace sir laurence is difficult to it
what can i say about the first film can't rate this because not supposed to be entertaining but if you have to rate it you should give it a it is stunning to see moving images from the year this was one of the most important movies in history i wonder how it was to be one of the people who saw the first movie
whatever you become in your must never forget that you have is the story of true facts that was made into a beautiful and moving movie i dare to say that this movie is well shows us a reality of more evil surrounds you the better person you in your instincts and be aware that the ideal of life is to live it living under a rock the movie concept is more that the storytelling with real life us aware of facts to emotions bless these people and make everyone happy see recommend it to all young not about racism about how to live your life
this movie took my breath away at some points i simply loved it admit that the character dialogs and storyline could have been done a bit better but hey this is just a simple story of a couple of guys trying to slain a dragon nothing more to overall design atmosphere the beautiful landscapes all just magical put a lot of love in this movie character designs were great and funny a bit tim burton-ish if you like i can recommend this movie to anyone interested in great design displayed in a simple small but lovely story
some war movies succeed where others do not and that can be judged from a variety of angles the humanistic angle one where you can feel the raw emotions terror of being under attack the camaraderie amongst soldiers the arduous trials people face inside them when in combat etc are always movies i find compelling movies like das boot and a midnight clear are but two examples of movies that you sense a connection to the characters in the film succeeds on that level as well it speaks of the highest honor and that honor is doing the right thing these soldiers did the right thing they had honor and it is recognized in a way wholly incompatible with western thought but it is to the very end a true story of honor unforgettable movie based on the true story
saw this in great wonderful witty and intelligent actors were peter falk will be up for an paul reiser was photography was marvelous reiser was at the theater when we saw the film and he gave a vivid account about the making of the it had been a long dream of his to write a semi-autobiographical account of relationships between sons and fathers and more specifically between him and his this was achieved in a dramatic and entertaining the supporting cast was well chosen and gave the film a feeling of i recommend this film to anyone who is longing to see intelligent drama and wonderful performances
the finnish version of robert short cuts set in the small rural town of äänekoski the episodes present a kaleidoscope of the eternal events problems and emotions of human life joy and love deception and disillusionment hopelessness and death i was particularly impressed by two episodes the first is the story of the young waitress who tries to stir up a romance for his co-workers she radiates an overwhelming joy of love and life the other episode presents and old man dying in a hospital and his wife trying to help him die with dignity particularly striking is the way the old couple have to fight their way against the humiliating practices of the hospital and their loneliness contrasted with the routines of the hospital crew the signs of occasional empathy compared with classic this movie is perhaps less professional but it is definitely a great piece of art
the story of cinderella is one of my favorites from charles perrault with sleeping beauty which was also made into a disney film in this film is a sweet enchanting masterpiece from film has a great soundtrack one i like in a movie is a very good soundtrack and i love the songs too my favorite song is the romantic so this is love i love the mice from the film too they are cute my favorite scene is the scene after the narration the little birds tried to wake cinderella up in the morning i also love it when animal friends mice and birds fix up dress so she could go to the drizella anastasia tore it to bits the
when i first saw this film in london in i was bowled over i had never seen a film like this before it had a strange hypnotic effect quite unlike the films that i had seen previously and it left a lasting believe that odile versios marina vlady are sisters if not twins certainly the interaction is amazing in its power to influence the this has been converted to dvd in region format and in the original french language i would love to hear about it where it can be purchased
both my friend and i thought this movie was well done we expected a light hearted comedy but got a full blown action movie with comic thrusts we both thought that this movie may have not done so well at the box office as the previews lead us to believe it was a comedy i was impressed with the supporting actors and of course dave morse always puts in a terrific acting job most of the supporting cast are veterans not first timers and they were solid we both felt that the writing and direction were first rate and made comments to each other about buying this movie if you don't buy rent it for a good time
as this movie is completely in swiss dialect probably hard for most german speakers to really follow this movie i'm not from switzerland but i worked there for some years so i had the chance to understand this great spoof of the lord of the rings i've seen a lot of movies of this kind scary movie loads of scifi spoofs etc but this one is the best one of that kind i've seen so far i give a of the only reason i can't give a is because there are some little details which could have been done better and because they supplied no subtitles in any language on the dvd so almost no chance for non-swiss to understand
this movie is a perfect portrayal of the nutcracker the dancing is wonderful the scenery in the background was excellent and i loved that floating and the costumes i particularly loved the tutu was adorable the special effects were very well done the tree the bed etc and i quite enjoyed the rats i love how they didn't make them scary but cute and huggable except for the king i you're a thoroughly masculine person you won't enjoy this but this is a very good movie good for all ages just not all levels of i have a few why did they have to put the sugar plum partner in those terrible tights it would barely make a difference if he was butt naked and secondly why on earth did they have to make outfit pink
for a comedy this has a decent and inventive plot and trey parker and matt comic timing is perfect there are dozens of funny moments to this fantastic movie i especially like the multitude of colors and the way the clash in the sports arena scenes robert stacks unsolved mysteries spoof is also very amusing
for whoever play games video games here did anybody notice that the city mansion inside the game and some other things including weapons from the movie that are connected to this movie and this movie inspired the makers of the game games to copy some things from this movie and by the way this is one of the best movies out there i recommend this for anybody who still didn't see it no questions asked
has anyone been able to buy this movie my uncle hutch was a real reel pilot who is seen tossing his wings in the air and then snatching them with his fist as he was awarded his wings only on screen a few seconds but my family would love to have the movie he was killed in a dogfight over italy he was only at the time do we know the film studio that made has anyone seen it at a video store like blockbuster i wish they would make entire catalogs of these old movies available as it is so cheap to make these email me at if you know where i can buy a copy thank you
other than susan wooden delivery throughout this film it was as good as any biblical film made henry king handles this film with the respect of an epic in all of the small scenes and peck is as always impeccable the stirring alfred newman sound score with the stirring twenty-third psalm is unforgettable even after these many years the scene with goliath is a bit on the hokey side but not all that badly done for the era in which this film was made this goes well alongside the lesser bible epics of the day the song of ruth and esther and the king it is worth watching and raymond massy is excellent as the prophet nathan the film is rounded out by the always fine james robertson justice as abishai and jayne meadows as michol estranged first wife
this game was really great and quite a challenge it has a great spooky story line and the graphics are also very good i would recommend this game to all horror fans and is very gripping from start to finish the only problem with this game is that i would have liked more weapons but thats just a truly great game for rpg and shoot'em'up
this movie is finally out on dvd in italy restored i have seen this movie so many times and i find it even actual these days when italy suffers again from a sort of brainwashing dictatorship the us for that matter i am glad there are outcasts as the one played by mastroianni in this movie who can sing out of tune maybe they can teach the sophia lorens of this world how to be strong and fight to be recognised as human to the movie as most people here already mentioned the acting is wonderful but the audio background is astonishing i must assume that unfortunately something is lost if you don't understand the italian language but i can assure you that the show-off of machism the distortion of reality in that ever-present radio-chronicle of the hitler visit to rome can really make you
this is truly one from the golden age of hollywood the kind they do not make anymore it is an unique fun movie that keeps you guessing what is going to happen next the actors are perfectly cast and they are all great supporting actors this is the first movie i saw with ronald colman in it and i have been a fan of his ever since reginald gardiner has always been a favorite supporting actor of mine and adds a certain quality to every movie he is in while he played a different kind of character here he still added something to the movie that another actor cast in this character would not have added
i first saw the trailer for frailty on yahoo movies way back in the day after hearing stephen king praise it to high heaven not really a fan of either star i still wanted to see it because i'm a huge thriller was not disappointed the acting was superb especially from the two young boys usually i loathe child actors but young adam and young fenton were excellent bill paxton really did a good job of directing it too it was beautifully must also note the plot twists the three twists at the end hit hard and fast and i didn't see them coming the final twist of the film coupled with the gravity of what had just been revealed gives me chills to this day even though i've re-watched the film so many true gem
forbidden planet is one of the best examples of hollywood sf films its influence was felt for more than a decade however certain elements relating to how this wide-screen entertainment was aimed at a mid-fifties audience that is now gone have dated it quite a bit and the sometimes sluggish pacing doesn't help but the compelling central idea involving the krell civilization and monsters from the id hasn't lost its appeal and continue to make this film a relevant must see movie what i'm mostly interested in saying here is that the current dvd for this movie is terrible the movie has never really looked that good on home video and elements are in dire need of restoration i hope that will happen soon and we get a special edition of this sf classic
i enjoyed every moment of this beautiful film and was intrigued about this female painter i had never heard of before so i set out exploring her life and work afterwards as could be expected i found out that the film was not exactly historically accurate i was a little astounded however by the very negative comments on the film because of this inaccuracy come on guys a film isn't and shouldn't be a biography a novel any historical film distorts reality because it should be a work of art in its own right a film director is fully entitled to use elements from reality and history to create a world of his own artemisia is a wonderful film and i think it brought many people some that now give negative comments to explore the life and work of this fascinating artist
this movie is a great way for the series to finally end peter boy from puppet master iii is all grown up and is now the puppet master well this girl comes to destroy the puppets and learn secrets but instead she listens to the story about the puppets most of this movie is footage from puppet master ii puppet master iii puppet master puppet master curse of the puppet master and retro puppet master but i guess paramount wouldn't let them use scenes from personally i wish puppet master vs demonic toys would finally be made but the way this movie ends they basically say this is the final movie in the series
i gave this film not because it is a superbly consistent movie but for pure ability to evoke emotions in its audience the story of is an old cliché by now but very few films have carried it off with so much warmth and sincerity as the color also showed a different side to the african-american experience showing that after slaves were granted freedom many fell into the ways of the hated white man and were abusive of their own people i find this an important point as it goes against the portray-white-on-black-violence-and-win-an-oscar the acting performances are superb especially oprah who i now have a new found respect worth watching but keep some tissue handy
father of the pride was another of those good shows that unfortunately don't have a very long life and that is pretty sad specially if you consider that almost all the time the worst shows are still on air think in the simple life i admit that are many similarities with this show and the simpsons but despite the similarities the show have it own merits the animation is just adequate not incredible but is good the best are the characters all the animals are very likable and funny and even sigfried and roy had their moments the music was good i liked many of the songs if the show isn't very original i think that this had lots of potential like mission hill a show that isn't very famous but i liked a lot this didn't have the appreciation that it deserved what a shame
terrfic film with a slightyly slow start give it a chance to start cooking story builds in interest and complexity characters and storyline subvert expectation and cliche at all the right moments superb new york city locations gritty real are a fantastic antidote to the commercial imperatives of sex in the city in fact the entire film is an antidote to the notion of new york city sex and relationships a rare film that treats its characters so honestly and compassionately loved it great cast with notable performances by steve buscemi rosario dawson and her love interest his name
it was a bit bizarre and evil and i enjoyed it a lot the characters in the show were great as well and complimented one another well i was sorry to see it cut off i would have loved to see where it could have found yourself leaning toward lucas buck the sheriff who had more secrets than anyone lucas was frightening and alluring and i would have liked to have seen more of him and how his character became i will however buy the show just to enjoy it was great to something different on tv and paige turrco who was cousin she was a big mystery as to where and what she meant to lucas its a shame it isn't around still or was never finished i would have loved to see what would have happened
an inventive suspenseful exercise in claustrophobia a japanese thriller that sets itself a tough challenge by being entirely set in two rooms not completely successful but taut surprising and well-acted one might find the film somewhat reminiscent of saw two men trapped in room and pitting against each other but unlike that film it dares to stay with its premise and keep the hero locked in his cell throughout the film like watching a lab experiment some might find the contained suspense tedious but this reviewer found it enthralling the sound and imagery of the film are stunningly well realized this is a certainly a good film to use to show off a good home video system just right for a late night movie fest when one is in the paranoid mood it certainly kept me awake that night
i recently found a copy for at a video store and snapped it up eagerly while the music and graphics aren't up to the standards of my favorite of the series beyond the eye i am still entranced by one and stella in breaking the ice the music is brilliant and the emotions feel real the clip on website doesn't have the story nor the music unfortunately
i only wish that return of the jedi have been directed by somebody else i mean there is far too much ewoks scenes completely unnecessary besides this time our heroes look like different people princess leia no longer fights with solo luke looks boring darth vader is not as evil as before and yoda just there are many extraordinary things going on this episode that i just can't hate spoilers jabba the hut the sail barge attack sequence emperor evil the speeders chase at the endor forest last battle dark side seduction scene return of anakin to the good side of the force and the last of those are so good that they can bring tears to your eyes if some scenes would have been cut and another director was hired this would have been as perfect as episode and but still is extraordinary out of
what can i say about this movie i have seen it quite a few times since the first time when i was around i have seen the english version and it is done very well it is a great movie for all ages but it is directed more for children i love the childlike humor and appreciate it if you have not seen it you should try to rent a copy you will not be disappointed
eddie murphy really made me laugh my ass off on this hbo stand up comedy love his impressions of mr norton and ralph cramden of the michael jackson ice cream goo also saw this for the first time when it came out in laughed so almost fell off my still think this is very he was on saturday night me laugh so is one of the best people to come out night murphy his best stand up performance next to eddie murphy give eddie murphy delirious thumbs up and stars
i believe this is the most powerful film hbo pictures has made to date this film should have been released in theaters for the public to view on the big screen it is available on video so make sure you look for it and check it out chris gerolmo did a great job with the direction and the screenplay the performances from stephen rea donald sutherland and jeffery demunn are flawless a masterpiece of the genre
rare that i sit down in front of the tv specifically to watch a particular programme even rarer when i actually enjoy the programme in the end but last of the blonde bombshells was one of the best movies i think i've remarkable cast led by dame judi dench and ian holm and an excellent witty and poignant script combined to make it a truly rewarding experience i can't really express how good i thought it was so i won't try i'll just say if you get the opportunity please see it i only hope it comes out on video
may have been a poor attempt at remaking the already recreated omen movie but i sure enjoyed last man who commented is a fool this movie was one of a kind and the music dark jerry goldsmith himself would had applaud this recommendations from myself to watch or buy this collect horror movies and soundtracks so listen to what i have to say not that other is only one thing that do not fascinate me the to prophecy it is all inaccurate including final conflict and left my conclusion being there great should be seen before the great depression falls upon us and before the democrats take over the presidency farmer with a mastermind
i loved long way round and wasn't even aware of race to dakar until i saw it on the shelves of my local supermarket i bought it and after a slightly hmm will this be as good first episode i decided that it was charlie boorman was great as were the other members of the crew great to see him with ewan again there was a fair bit of swearing in it but that didn't bother me as for their being no mention of it on the package thats more to do with the silly excempt from classification certificate that the bbfc have they should have given it a just for the language recommended series i want more
deeply humorous yet honest comedy about a bunch of grownups paxton julie warner kevin pollak elizabeth perkins vincent spano matt craven and diane lane who are invited back to spend a week to tomawka a camp in canada by their former consuelor arkin mike binder drew upon his experience at the same camp as the main source of creating a gentle and understanding yarn that makes sense also the movie has plenty of funny moments some of which are completely bizarre like my favorite the one involves using masking tape newton thomas sigel usual suspects three kings provides the film with some impressive shots of the canadian wilderness among the cast sam raimi director of the evil dead films and the gift appears here as bumbling right-hand man one more thing this film reassured me that a camp doesn't have to be a site of bloody murders
besides the fact that it was one of the few movies that i ever shed a tear over manhood this is one of the most beautifully crafted indian films that has ever been made from the finely crafted sets to those haunting looks meena kumari gives no one can ever forget it the music of pakeezah is amazing all the more if you can understand the sublime poetry and is definitely one of those omg minutes another song movies you get the feeling of how trapped sahibjaan is in among all the amazing jewelery she wears and fountained court yard she casually walks parody of all the dreams you've ever had
upon seeing this film once again it appeared infinitely superior to me this time than the previous times i have viewed it the acting is stunningly wonderful the characters are very clearly drawn brad pitt is simply superb as the errant son who rebels the other actors and actresses are equally fine in every respect robert redford creates a wonderful period piece from the days of speakeasies of the the scenery is incredibly beautiful of the mountains and streams of western montana all in all this is one of the finest films made in the must see this
i saw this movie back in we first started watching this is spinal tap and after minutes we were ready to fall asleep so we went instead to see this movie if you have any conspiracy going around in your head you will want to watch this one question you have to ask yourself when watching this movie are do you think the government would be capable of doing this my opinion there is no doubt that they could i don't want to give out too much information as that would be a spoiler and i think that you should view the movie for just to let you know we still talk about this movie years later and trying to explain it to people is not the easiest thing in the world to do
first-time director tom kiesche turns in a winning film in the spirit of cutting dark comedy shot on a shoestring budget yet had the flavor of the early coen film blood simple and throw in some monty python flavorings to boot needs to seen more than once to appreciate all the elements that carry one scene to the next expect more good things to come from this writer-director-actor
for what it is raising victor vargas is about as close to perfection as a film can get either sheer genius from a fledgling auteur or just one of those lucky mixes where everything clicked some of each this simple little slice-of-urban-life ethnic first love flick fleshes out its young characters with such depth you can almost read their minds the film begins with a strong flavor of street but works its way into a latino family affair and then focuses on a story which speaks volumes about the uncertainty of youth and the profoundly natural desire to love another in my experience never has so much been done with so little of tyros novice director etc praised by the critics but not for everyone raising victor vargas is recommended for indie lovers and realists into simple tales rich in humanness
based on christy autobiographical novel this endearing film tells the story of his life him being affected by cerebral palsy and being considered basically not a person by everyone including his mother amazingly he teaches himself to draw and write using his foot which is the only part of him he can control an amazing story of courage with a truly amazing and unforgettable oscar winning performance by daniel day lewis of
this is an early film pilot for the hit canadian tv show trailer park boys it was played to executives at a few networks before showcase decided to sign them up for a tv series great acting and a very funny cast make this one of the best cult comedy films the movie plot is that these two small time criminals go around exterminating peoples pets for money if you have a dog next door whos barking all night these are the guys you go to but they get into trouble when they come across a job too big for them to deal with and end up in a shootout watch this movie if you want to understand the beginning of the tv series i highly recommend r for swearing violence and drug not too offensive either dont actually show killing animals
after seeing break a leg in vancouver at the release party i thought it was a very enjoyable had a few outright belly laughs and some of the cameos roberts in particular were a scream i haven't heard word about actual release date although i've heard story is simple but is mainly a vehicle for the characters and situations the script is smooth and seamless the plot develops effortlessly and the acting is comfortable yet fresh this film has won at least one award from each of the film festivals been in which is around or highly recommend break a leg
this is what the musical genre was made of humor talent romance and action all rolled into sinatra was wonderful nothing else needs to be said marlon brando although not a singer did a great job winning the hearts of many with his portrayal of sky masterson the fact that he couldn't sing added to his character the ladies in the film were alright but the men in the movie definitely stole the is a true classic that can be appreciated at any age it connects with all audiences and makes you smile and a movie to be watched and enjoyed
this is the most confronting documentary i have ever seen it was a simple and breathtaking view of a beautiful idea based on photographs of the hidden industrial landscapes centred around the modern industrial growth of china edward burtynsky brings to life confronting issues that we so easily chose to no political sides this movie is a neutral moving picture of realities that our western societies chooses not to educate us about the by-products of economical growth the externalities paid by citizens of the lesser-developed communities the source of our comforts and the wastes of our consumer heart-breaking impossible to ignore this is a challenging journey but one worth taking please stop staying ignorant and at least see these photographs of truth without feeling any pressure to take a standing to these issues definitely
this movie is not for everyone you're either bright enough to get it or you're not fans of sci-fi films who don't take themselves too seriously definitely will enjoy this movie i recommend this movie for those who can appreciate spoofs and parodies everyone i've recommended this film to has enjoyed it if you enjoy monty python or mel brooks films you'll probably enjoy this one the voice characterizations are done in a tongue-in-cheek manner and the one-liners fly fast and furious
who doesn't have unresolved issues with parents and which parents don't have unresolved issues with each know that sounds heavy but this is played for laughs in the movie making both the comedy better and the drama better i've always like paul reiser and peter falk and although i was a bit concerned that their star qualities might be too big for a small movie i was enchanted from the very first entertaining were the discoveries that the son makes about his father as a person and peter monologue about being a hard-working sacrificing father and husband was the perfect balancing point without that scene being acted so well the movie would have seemed far less nuanced and the character far less done paul and peter
a series of vignettes most of them spoofing television of the but also with some digs at the government and corporate america one of the longest segments the dealers is not that funny to me and i don't know what it is parodying some of the others though are absolutely side-splitting i particularly enjoy the cooking show segment most of the foul words i know are used in the movie and if you object to full frontal nudity stay away
how anyone can say this is bad is beyond me i loved this show before i even saw it for reasons the story intrigued me jessica alba and james cameron please ignore the bad comments and please watch the whole first season before you decide that bad because i know that if you watch the first season you will love it and go out and buy season as well as season on dvd and then join the campaign to get season hate fox and i'm sure a lot of you dark angel fans hate them too they have a thing for canning good shows don't you all agree
there are comments as i add mine to this list and there is barely a criticism this is because this film is terrific entertainment and has a bit of everything in is perhaps a little frightening for younger children but my old son thought it was fantastic in every way from the action to the humour and even to the beautiful music buy dvds only when i know that they are going to be regularly watched and now that this is finally available in the uk i will certainly be adding it to my collection
the filming is pleasant and the environment is keenly realistic i liked that it boldly redresses conceptions of the many difficult moral and social morays of the chinese-mainland countryside as well as more basic human questions i felt i could get a real sense of the times recreated even in splendid shots of traditional chinese theatre and in purist depictions of street living it seemed worthwhile to experience the interwoven role which buddhism plays is probably the most true-to-form both in its menial and in its philosophic aspect perhaps the most effective that i've seen in chinese film casting is great images are memorable acting is solid enough thematically puerile but still rich enough to compliment the vehicle of its expression
fritz german medieval saga continues in die nibelungen kriemhilds rache schoen wants to avenge her murdered husband brother is too weak to bring the murdered hagen to marries etzel the king of the huns gives birth to a child and invites her brothers for a and the other huns should kil hagen but he is protected by his see a huge battle of life and death begins and she sets the whole place on hagen is dead and so is movies deal with great themes such as revenge and undying we have later seen some better movies made of those topics but this was one of the early ones
as i was when i saw this movie i will never watch this movie again not because it is a bad movie but because it scared me so much as i said i was when my english teacher decided to show it to us the reason for this is that we had read an extract from the the girls in my class were terrified when the woman in black comes through the window and floats over bed although just before that there is something that also frightened us which was when kidd finds the toy soldier underneath his pillow and he hears a voice say for you that scene still haunts me to this day nearly years after i saw the you are easily scared avoid this film
this movie was amazing i watched it while i was in the town next to the one where he grew up i went and saw the buildings that the story took place in overall i loved this movie one of jake best my favorite parts were the science fair and all the times with his father they were so sad it seemed homer wanted to follow his dream and his dad didn't seem to care one way or another that tag line is true sometimes one dream is bright enough to light up the sky the way this movie was shot was impeccable it was all so believable that it could have been recorded during the dress was accurate and they had their slang down too definitely recommend this movie
this is a good movie but it is not recommended if you don't like intelligent movies about two guys that wish that the world would go exactly what they get the acting is great the ending was not it actually had a good story unlike most movies these days people complain about the movie being too simple or too boring i think they should just stick to movies like the toxic avenger actually like b movies or the grim adventures of billy and mandy one note if you notice this this has exactly the same actors from cube except four actors make it two notes wait after the credits me on this one enjoy the movie
i went to see fever pitch with my mom and i can say that we both loved it it wasn't the typical romantic comedy where someone is pining for the other and blah blah blah you weren't waiting for the climatic first kiss or for them to finally get together it was more real because you saw them through the relationship rather than the whole movie be about them getting together people could actually relate to the film because it didn't seem like extraordinary circumstances or impossible situations it was really funny and i think it was jimmy best performance all in all i would definitely recommend it
this is one of the funniest movies that i have seen this year the people that made it must be so incredibly whacked and twisted it is a beautiful thing there were a lot of quality one-liners this movie blew uncle sam out of the water was made by tha same people i think
ghost story tv was the pilot for the nbc series the movie was well-written and well-acted and i thought when the tv season started if the tv series is half as good as the movie then nbc has a winner wish this film was available on video the series was a colossal with william castle as exec producer if have a chance to see the original tv movie ghost story check it out you won't be disappointed
now a film straight out of my childhood my family used to taped but it kind of got tapped over and losted over the years now i was fortunate to watch the whole film on i had love this wonderful film when i watched it as kid and after watching again i still do today my favorite song from the movie is candy hearts and paper flowers will always remember that sweet song forever was surprised when i looked at the opening credits who animated some of the animators date back to like years
this film caught me by surprise my friend told me that this movie was a chick flick boy was he wrong this movie has a great family appeal with no sex scenes like movies jake gyllenhaal does an excellent job in homer shoes the supporting cast is great as coming-of-age family quarrels a great train scene this film has it all the soundtrack is good although the score is presented quite choppily the music kicks the movie over the edge of dvd is definitely worth its weigh in coal replay value is great i've seen it quite a few times already
powers booth is hypnotic as cult leader jim jones who led his peoples temple followers from until when he led them in a mass suicide in where over died a very well done movie which may seem a little dated due to the time period but well worth the time of
i found this a very entertaining small kids movie that actually is geared more for adults with a lot of jokes and humor only they would understand a few things are inappropriate for the kiddies but just a few othewise the grinch carrey cracks so many jokes you can't keep up with them all ranging from sexual to cultural to insider-hollywood to film is very colorful and looks great on dvd the little girl in here cindy lou who momsen is really cute and the costumes and hairdos of the little people in here are fun to view anthony hopkins voice is pleasing too so having his narrate this elevates the movie further his rhymes are fun to saw this in the theater though it was fair but on dvd it was far better i've seen in three times and it got better each time
richard willaims is an animation god he was hampered in directing this film by the producer the final product is a very uneven film with a very convoluted story but some amazing moments of animation emery hawkins greedy joe repetitive music doesn't help either it was made in wide screen so the vhs doesn't show it in all glory hope for a letterboxed dvd someday still worth watching for some eye popping animation
simply one of the best ever richard brooks adaptation of truman non-fiction novel is truly an artistic achievement stunning black and white cinematography should have won an oscar a haunting quincy jones score and tremendous performances by robert blake and scott wilson as the oddly-matched killers this film was for at the academy awards and wasn't even nominated for best picture while dr doolittle was go figure you don't get to know the clutter family as well as you do in the book it was a good decision to focus more on perry and dick and the pain-staking process of tracking these guys down john forsythe is also impressive as alvin dewey there are simply no flaws in this one out of best performance scott wilson with r blake a close second highly recommended
and why movies are so important to all of us moreover when they are so well done like this i saw the young victoria i knew a few things about queen victoria but in the end i got much more knowledge about it blunt is simply great as victoria would guess that and she probably will get a nomination at this years personally i'm cheering for technical issues i am pleased to say that is a very successful production with wonderful art decoration and of course like it was expected to be a terrific periodic costume design one drawback is that i want to see more and know more about this interesting queen but foremost incredible woman and mother out of
i bought the video rather late in my collecting and probably would have saved a lot of money if i bought it earlier it invariably supersedes anything else on those moon nights cher and olympia certainly deserve their awards but this is really a flawless ensemble performance of a superb screenplay what you don't know what a moon is
this anime was underrated and still is hardly the dorky kids movie as noted i still come back to this years after i first saw it one of the better movies animation while not perfect is good camera tricks give it a feel and the story is still as good today even after i grew up and saw ground-breakers like neon genesis evangelion and rahxephon it has nowhere near the depth obviously but try to see it from a lighthearted view a story to entertain not to one of my favourites i come back too when i feel like a giggle on over more lighthearted animes not to say its a childish movies there are surprisingly sad moments in this and you need a sense of humour to see it all
this is the movie i've seen more times than any other believe i saw it on average once every year since it was released and every time i see it it is equally fantastic and always reveals something new to me the cast was most probably a combination of the very best there ever was in ex yu cinematography this movie is an absolute must for any self respecting movie lover in the same league maratonci trce pocasni krug balkanski spijun and otac na sluzbenom putu this is a poker of movies everyone should have in his private video collection
i bought this cheap from the rental remnant at our local store it was in almost mint condition and i'd never heard of it before clearly nobody else had can't believe my luck you go through the whole realm of emotions and it attempts to get over a complex message the very moral and non-triumphalist stance of the mandela party undoubtedly despite its enormous length had to watch it in two sittings it was like a book one couldn't put down perhaps the songs are not all that memorable but the spirit of the thing glows on forever i cannot understand comments that a musical designed for stage is not realistic i've seen south pacific and read the book too and can guarantee that musical is not realistic compared to the book i'll treasure this little find until it wears out one day they'll make this again on a better
i thought this movie was stunning with completely outstanding performances by valentina cervi portrays artemisia so beautifully with tentative yet confidant mannerisms her hands mapping out an idea before moving her models into place the passion to which artemisia gives to her art is just spectacular to not each character was overtly beautiful this made the film more realistic as the facial hair and clothing was perfect for that point in i thought this film was fantastic
have to be honest and say that i haven't seen many independent films but i thought this one was very well done the direction and cinematography were engaging without becoming a distraction the angles settings and lighting used successfully created the nightmarish world in which the main character was trapped many haunting and memorable images from the film stick in your mind long after over a sign of a good director
this is one of the best films i have seen in years i am not a gwyneth paltrow fan but she is excellent as emma woodhouse alan cumming is superb as reverand elton and emma sister sophie is hysterical as miss bates and check out the gorgeous jeremy northam as mr knightley what a gentleman whoever said you need sex and violence in a movie to make it good has never seen emma i think that is what separates it from so many you're looking for a film that you can watch with the whole family or looking for a romance for yourself look no further emma is that movie with a beautiful setting wonderful costumes and an outstanding cast i mentioned the gorgeous jeremy northam emma is a perfect ten
opening the film with a bach toccata is an aural hint of what is to unfold in this intense drama all the compositional devices bach perfected to keep his listener the performer intrigued and entertained applies to this film there isn't a mutual tenderness between the two lead characters and the lead female in the final scene i feel is justified in stating she was raped even though her victimizer feels she was forewarned that he was a cad mamet compellingly explores the emotional chasm and differences between the genders but i feel he is clueless about how they actually compliment one another given a healthy sense of humor if mamet ever developed a healthy humorous take on the interaction between the genders i wonder how this work would have ended as it exists it is very somber and mean spirited
this tender beautifully crafted production delved deep down bitter sweet into my being the irreverent pupils the life embittered bus driver and the teachers personalities present a subliminal debate as the story unveils the adult characters all seem familiar my teachers my bus driver each one of their opinions so plausible and well known when a key incident happens on the bus we are sent on a circuit of viewpoints all the time the babble of teenage energy is only just kept under control by the organisers of the trip mr harvey is experiencing much pain throughout he reminds me of war damaged teachers i did not understand when i was an irreverent brook and the producers deserve much acclaim for this well shaped british film the acting unblemished the scenes appropriate it should be widely available yet does not seem to have been given the right opportunity
the setting and actors make this television movie for me the best rendition of dickens classic tale george c scott is very believable as is the rest of the cast his scrooge oozes with nastiness until the very end of the movie then his character changes to one who is truly repentant the century english town chosen for the setting creates an ambiance that is fitting to dickens and adds to the plausibility of this film it is a movie i watch every christmas along with the real grinch and a wonderful life
when i first saw this movie i thought it was the typical love thy neighbour more the movie was going on the more i got involved acting is magnificent from both actors direction was great the story unusual cried my eyes off first time in my life for a movie a real must have in any serious videoteque out of
super speedway makes a great demo of your new dvd bigscreen channel sound system the imax camera puts you right in the race car where you cruise around various tracks at high speed reminiscent of the driving sequences in grand prix only that would appear on dvd i enjoy watching it again and only minus and why i didn't give it a is some of the driving sequences look suspiciously like the film was speeded up the soundtrack also requires a little suspension of disbelief all you can hear in a real car is the engine you won't hear swooshes as you go under bridges
being someone who lists night of the living dead at number three in her top five favorite movies of all time and at the same time loving this student film parody i feel i must defend this movie against the previously posted scathing reviews this short but sweet opus has always been a crowd-pleaser at horror and science fiction movie marathons where those who attend have a love of the genre yet know not to take zombie movies too seriously this film is a tribute to the original not an insult it is intended to be funny and many others who i have heard chant for and applaud it agree with me that it succeeds especially for those of us who have seen notld times watch for the director cameo as news reporter jeff drexel and also if you have the opportunity catch his alien parody loaf
i would have given this otherwise terrific series a full vote if claudia black had not continued on in it her inclusion as the silly vela has brought the series down in my estimation to bring her in as a regular at the same time as including ben browder to replace rda was a we were just reeling from the loss of jack and really didn't need this great series turned into new episodes of was a great fan of the film stargate and when the series was first announced i had reservations that it could live up to the film but after watching the first episode i have to admit i was hooked i have always looked forward to new episodes with great anticipation
one of the best comedians ever i've seen this show about times and will probably watch it at least more my friends and family quote from this dvd so often you'd think we did nothing other than watch it the beginning part about alcatraz is a little bit slow but either wade through it or zip on through to the part where eddie is on stage watch for the cake or death part about the church of england and the pot part to explain just watch it the best part of the show may be facial expressions he can really say a lot with his eyes eyeliner and eyeshadow probably help huh fair warning eddie does have a tendency to throw a lot of four-letter words in
this is one amazing movie you have to realize that chinese folklore is complicated and philosophical there are always stories behind stories i myself did not understand everything but knowing chinese folklore studied them in is very complicated you just have to take what it gives the movie and enjoy the
esther williams gets her first post mgm starring role and gets a good start this film is a well acted entertaining a mature theme that would be repeated a million times the future innocent girl stalked creepy woman hater great and if she wanted to probably could have gone on more and better films but according to her autobiography much gave up working for marriage either way she is and engaging that its fun to see her in a totally different of the swimming musical universal was fabulous films with former mgm stars after that studio its biggest names as it began to slide down hill lana turner june allyson and others got to make quality films at universal as they obviously still had drawing power box office i wish esther had made more but since she didnt this one all the more special
the first time i came upon delirious i only heard it i listened to the entire comedic performance and never have i laughed so much in my life ability to paint hilarious pictures in our minds and do great imitation is captivating when i finally got to see him perform this act i had to have it eddie performance on delirious shows his genius with it being the new millennium his acts in is just as funny today as it was then my parents loved it as teenagers and i eighteen love it as well from that point on i had to view other movies such as coming to america and harlem nights there will be no other comedian like eddie
reese witherspoon plays dani a young country girl that falls madly in love with the new year old neighbor court played by jason london court tries his best to make dani realize that the difference in their ages would make a love relationship improbable soon the nubile charm of dani starts winning over will next enters the meeting of older sister played by emily warfield and the beginning of a short lived harper and sam waterston round out the cast this is a fresh free spirited but heartbreaking drama that touches down deep feel free to cry
if you enjoy cleese all the british pythonesque humour of the time then this little gem is absolutely lowe is a real saw this with friends on tv when it first came out and its classic quotes have formed a part of our jokes for years and will do forever i have it on tape and it is continually some reviewers are taking it too can't believe it is now only available in the us of course and not in uk where it should be an essential part of the history of british humour
in april of cbs broadcast the first of barbra monumental television specials the show was not only a runaway ratings success but garnered emmy awards as well this is one of the most memorable moments of television and the kind of television special they don't produce anymore filled with wonderful songs and a spectacular performance by barbra this special is a must view for any streisand fan and anyone interested in early television
i loved this movie it was all i could do not to break down into tears while watching it but it is really very uplifting i was struck by the performance of ray liotta but especially the talent of tom hulce portraying twin brother who is mentally slow due to a tragic and terrible childhood event but character though heartbreaking knows no self pity and is so full of hope and life this is a great movie don't miss it
i like this movie a lot but a fact that you cannot understand it unless you're from the ex yugoslavia most of the actors are now dead and those were the best actors in ex yugoslavia i appreciate that this movie is now on divx and i can have it in my collection macedonia serbia montenegro bosnia and herzegowina croatia of this was ex yugoslavia a melting pot of the balcan nations it could be a dream land if slobodan milosevic franjo tudjman and other nationalists wouldn't poison the mind with their sick ideas
eddie murphy delirious is undoubtedly the funniest thing i have ever seen in my life when i saw it for the first time about years ago i was in stitches for weeks after it to date i have seen it a further times and i still laugh my ass off each time for those who dont know eddie murphy was a brilliant stand up comedian before he was a hollywood superstar there is not one dull spot in this piece of genius unlike eddie murphy raw which was released in which goes flat during the middle if you are not the sort of person who can't stand swearing then i wouldn't advise you to see it as you will probably hear swearing of some form every seconds i gave this a out of because it displays the greatest comic genius of them all at his best
anyone interested in pop music and not familiar with british music trends of the late-seventies should be sure to watch breaking glass at least once the movie about a young quest to make her mark in the music world captures the times perfectly from the overt sexism rough economic times social upheaval to the shift in pop culture from rough-and-tumble punk to terribly fey and pretentious romanticism the music and fashion styles created daily in britain in the late-seventies are still being rediscovered and recycled really has been nothing new since this was a dazzling time and breaking glass both tells a very personal story and surveys the cultural landscape and does both extremely well
the straight story is a multilevel exploration of the goodness and beauty of america at one level a slow walk through the heartland kind inhabitants and amber grain at another level about growing old and remembering what is actively forgetting what isn't david lynch gives us time in this movie and helps me to remember that so much can be said with silence a remarkable movie that will rest gently with me for some time to come
i never thought an old cartoon would bring tears to my eyes when i first purchased casper friends spooking about africa i so much wanted to see the very first casper cartoon entitled the friendly ghost but when i saw the next cartoon good boos to-night it made me break down i couldn't believe how sad and tragic it was after seeing fox get killed i never saw anything like that in the other casper cartoons this is the saddest one of all it was so depressing i just couldn't watch it again just like seeing lassie die at the end of a movie i know a too much for us old cartoon fans to handle like me if i wanted to watch something old and classic i rather watch something happy and funny but when i think about this casper cartoon i think about my cats
holly addresses the issue of child sexploitation that is rampant all over the world million children are trafficked every year and does so sensitively and without tall order that the team at priority films does with great success american actor ron livington stars in the film alongside newcomer thuy nguyen a vietnamese actress who plays holly and together they bring to screen what is commonplace to the people at the notorious redlight district in cambodia although it tackles a heavy topic the film holds on to moments of laughter and hope as we get to know the characters up close keeping the two-hour film from being one that is too difficult to watch i am glad a film like this is bringing the attention to the problem child prostitution needs to be stopped and this is a very good first step great and a film everyone must see
although critically maligned johnny dangerously is one of the funniest movies i've ever seen a movie that should be watched closely some of the funny bits are done in passing and do not have the usual amount of attention drawn to them for instance keep an eye on michael use of the pricing gun at the pet also on the documentary-style years that appear at the beginning of scenes one of those rare movies where the humor hits you unexpectedly even though you know a comedy amy heckerling the director is really sharp you enjoyed her better known films times at ridgemont high clueless european vacation should give this one a keaton is extremely likable in the title role and the supporting cast dunne maureen stapleton joe piscopo peter boyle is excellent highly recommended
i loved watching sea hunt back in the day i was in grammar school and would get home do my homework and by would be ready to watch sea hunt and mike nelson in his underwater adventures i loved it he took to you a place not very accessible at that time under the great blue sea pre thunderball or even before cousteau became common there was mike nelson sparking the imagination of kids i'd be willing to wager that more than a few kids developed their passion for oceanography or biology or one of the sciences from watching this show underwater photography also progressed the fascination for exploration is easily stimulated thru watching this show watch and enjoy
call me adolescent but i really do think that this is a great series if you haven't had a chance to experience a few episodes of the latest star trek series you should definitely watch this one perhaps more compelling than that of caretaker which launched the series with cpt janeway adventures are completely different yet strangely music is catchy too no true sci-fi fan can go without seeing at least one star trek these installments make the wait worthwhile
what a perfect example of less is more kurt russell todd only has lines and something like words what a challenge like a black and white photo when your eye has to fill in the blanks the facial expressions the physical drama the emotive gesture all combines to make a stronger impact this is one of those top movies i can't live without right up there with the classics like road warrior if you liked this check out mad max the road warrior and braveheart both starring mel gibson also gladiator with russell crowe and connie nielsen who was in soldier also the thirteenth warrior starring antonio banderas and blade runner starring harrison ford
this movie is best described or compare to big fish movie by tim burton but a less glamorous and more in you face tale and of course here not the father but his grandfather who tells the narrative also moves back and forth the story outline here at imdb might tell you more than you would like to read before watching the movie funny and engaging enough even though you get from one story to another and have some dramatic moments too it also surprises you here and there with things you wouldn't expect a nice little movie then that deserves your attention especially if you like movies like that o
this film was just absolutly brilliant it actually made me think during the whole movie i was confused as hell i loved everything about was just so confusing and so twisted and weird it was hard not to love it all of the actors were phenominal and no one could have done a better is one of my favorites of the deserves an ocar
when seeing this movie you should take notice to that not a normal movie it has no real story just characters a bunch of gangster characters who come together in a perfect harmony the dialogue is wonderful you can just lay back and listen the movie stands out thats why hard to find a right way of describing why the user comments on this movie is so for one love the movie and recommend it to all who love one-liners and things that differ from the normal you really put the finger on so wonderful about it just a comical world where gangsters rule a place of love and danger a movie that you can see more than one time
i wasn't sure what to expect but am i glad i went to see this a smart slightly twisted comedy that makes you think i wasn't quite sure how a director can create nothing but leave it to mr natali and the brilliant individuals at to create another low budget set that looks real real as nothing can be well worth your time and money if you have the opportunity to see this please go you'll be glad you did
this movie leaves the intellectual mind thinking and trying to analyze the story i too cannot understand why people would trash this you are a jerry bruckheimer fan this movie may not suitable for movie presents high degree of realism the actors and actresses performance is examplary not fake just natural special so special side camera work is excellent the music is oh so good i can't wait to get the leaves your body numb like constant directly has raw talent certainly not a follower
a longtime fan of bette midler i must say her recorded live concerts are my favorites bette thrills us with her jokes and brings us to tears with her ballads a literal rainbow of emotion and talent bette shows us her best from her solid repertoire as well as new songs from the bette of roses album spanning generations of people she offers something for everyone the one and only divine diva proves here that she is the most intensely talented performer around
this is apparently one of first shorts with the stooges excludes his much earlier vaudeville years with the team but the comedic timing is at its honed best here aside from the intense slapstick scenes there are others more subtle but just as funny watch larry when shemp asks him to look at the camera for a snapshot or watch the real object prompting exclamation polished sitka is at his bewildered goofiest and the goon may look scary but somehow funny he seems as frustrated and perplexed with the stooges as are regular people in other shemp aficionados this is a must have episode it won't disappoint
a great idea stories about september directors from different countries with different results ken loach talking about an immigrant usual is just brilliant usual the frenchman does a very good job also while the burkina faso film was a nice surprise however the israel film was a bit boring and the mexican guy well he should quit directing and work in a mexican restaurant
i absolutely love this movie and would really like to have it someday just a fascinating legend about an eagle who wears a turquoise necklace i loved it and would like to see it again i don't remember too much about it but that a native american boy lives in a nice village with his family and i don't remember what happens but he is supposed to go out to the wilderness alone his sister packs him some food and he goes while out there some other indian boys come running out and put some feathers on him and he turns into an eagle the legend says that if you ever see an eagle wearing a turquoise necklace it is the boy i was always fascinated with legends particularly native american legends and i would love to see this released someday to a dvd please release it concerned
although dig was being hailed as being closest to what the music industry is like it is highly fabricated the director has misled the audience into believing the brian jonestown massacre disappeared off the face of the earth and the rivalry between the dandy warhols and jonestown has been milked the truth of the matter is not really exposed in this said this film is endlessly quotable and is an interesting watch as we get a look at two groups of very talented musicians creating their art one of the best things this film has going for it is a unique perspective between the indie music scene and the larger corporate mostly for the music and the two fantastic bands
very few chess movies have been made over the last couple of years but this one is more than just a chess movie its a story about the need to be loved and the need to win toturro plays a psychologically challenged man nothing matters to him accept squares and pieces the game validates him as a person when he looses a game he looses the one thing that makes sense to him and john torturro expresses this in a beautiful the love of a woman was not enough to save him from his sad makes you wonder if there other out there who obsess about the am sure they you are a chess enthusiast it won't hurt to watch an intelligent piece of work laid out properly and executed achieves its i doubt if there will be sequel
do you still love woody humor and sense of the absurd do you wait patiently for movies that get the plot going in the first five minutes instead of making you wait around if so you will adore this comedic murder mystery it has all the elements of a good mystery sharp plot a handsome suspect romance and intrigue mixed together with enough laughs and winks at fate to keep even the most jaded of movie goers beautiful people and gorgeous homes and landscapes to ogle this frothy movie is just the thing to take your minds off your troubles as woody might say not to like
with all the negative comments after having seen this film for the first time tonight i can only say that this is a good holiday comedy that is sure to brighten up any lonely day when i saw that drew affleck might end up spending the holidays alone i wanted to cry you'll have to see the movie if you want to know why also even though i liked tom gandolfini and alicia applegate after awhile if you ask me they were real snobs however this film did make me smile and feel good inside before i wrap this up i'd like to say that mike mitchell has scored a pure holiday hit now in conclusion i highly recommend this good holiday comedy that is sure to brighten up any lonely day to any ben affleck or christina applegate fan who hasn't seen it
i saw this film in winnipeg recently appropriate given the location used i first read book back in the and for me always been a very powerful picture of the trials of aging in our society it resonated when i was young and it resonates even more now when the film came out i was keen to see if the story could survive and was thoroughly impressed especially with ellen performance she manages to give us a complete human being even though the character is generally cranky and judgmental someone that you wouldn't want to live with great to be able to see favourite characters come to life so authentically
this is simply one of the finest renditions of classic tale the script very accurately follows the story originally penned by dickens and captures a perfect balance between a film atmosphere and a play atmosphere viewers fond of either format will find enough of the story rooted in their presentation style of c scott brings a delightfully realistic approach to the character of scrooge and is very convincing in the character development instigated by the visits of the ghosts i found that he was able to win me over to the point where i sympathized with the old miser something rarely done in other versions the superb job done by the supporting actors add greatly to this production which is simply the most enjoyable of all the christmas carol versions i have seen
i always enjoy this movie when it shows up on one scene that always stands out for me that is is the one with the myrna loy and the painters foreman where she gives him very explicit instructions on the colours and as soon as she goes away he turns the his guys and says did you get that yellow blue green and white
best show since seinfeld really really funny her total self centeredness the hulking gay stoner neighbors the departures into song or cartoons make this the freshest show on tv one of the few shows i make point of watching the scene with the wise old black lady in the drugstore wait now that you're close you do look old turns face with finger and walks away lol the cough syrup overdose sleeping with god all so funny or so stupid just a lot of fun the shows weak points are her sister and the cop-only because they're too darn normal i really can't wait until the next show something i haven't felt for any show in a long time
very good point there only an elite few upper classes would both have access to the internet and be able to communicate on an exclusively english speaking site such as the imdb some might think internet is not reality but this point of view really put media society and democracy at stake you are probably right even if there is internet in venezuela most chavez supporters will not afford to even rent a computer for half an hour to comment on you faschist upper class rich right wing capitalist liberal intellectual surpressors probably this is your first time using internet
i've seen mystery men cop a bit of stick in the press and with the general public take the imdb vote for instance but my overall feeling is that mystery men is more fun than most films definitely wittier than most so-called comedy films and very nearly cast is superb greg kinnear is excellent as are geoffrey rush and tom waits limo scene with ricky jay is perfect spoiled movie star and he imbues his character with the right balance of comic book quality and realism to make him will admit the pacing is a little off in places and visuals are certainly very flash bang possibly to the detriment of further characterisation but at the end of the day this is high concept film making about the little moments up tiger lily and there are so many great ones in this film to make it worth repeated viewing
this movie is gorgeous real and down to heart but at the same time totally crazy the characters are easy to fall in love with because they have so many different minds but each of us could refer to at least on in canada we don't have many movies from eastern europe and for the few i have seen loners is one of the best very funny and magic if you want to see something new and refreshing go see loners
dad had taped this movie for me when i was by age i had watched it over times i just watched it and watched it and i still do today it has a grim storyline a mother is killed by a very emotional wants to become a wolf like him after years of training the lamb is made into a really really evil looking thing he and the wolf travel to his old barn but he cannot kill the lambs no matter how much he wishes to he ends up killing the wolf but is no longer seen as a lamb by his former friends and can't return to his previous way of art is beautiful the songs okay and the voice acting is better than some things in all you just to see this movie it is a great masterpiece although very hard to find
i cried my heart out watching this movie i have never suffered from any eating disorder but i think this must be a very true lohman is excellent she expresses these feelings amazingly well my teenage years came back to me so vividly anyone who has gone through difficult times as a child or teenager will be able to relate to this movie i recommend you all to see music is great too i've now discovered diana also looking forward to seeing alison lohman in white oléander because i am positive she is perfectly suited for the role as agnes
this for me was a wonderful introduction to the talents and beauty of marion davies she is not only gorgeous but hilarious in this film believe that lucille ball may have modeled her later career on davies style that could be termed zany beauty direction is light but sure-handed the story is a chestnut of course but the acting is marvelously contemporary and the star-watching element for fans of the silent era with many cameos adds to the overall fun it combines the elements of slapstick with adult drama and good old timeless romance quite well for all movie fans who have a knee-jerk reaction to watching silent films sit through this one and it may change your attitude
unlike another user who said this movie sucked that olivia hussey was terrible i movie was amazing olivia hussey is awesome in everything in yeah she may be older now because many remember her from romeo and juliet but wonderful story line may be used quite often but a unique movie and i'll fight back on anyone who disagrees i enjoyed this movie just as much as i have any other olivia hussey movie my girl and i love her saw this for the first time on saturday and fell in love with it not only an olivia movie but because of unique story line and wonderful direction
this is the only full length feature film about the world of bridge i found the first minutes a bit slow but after that the movie is absolutely perfect in describing professional bridge players and how they go about earning a living of the scenes are very funny i don't think that a non-bridge player would get the charm of this movie of the dresses are really beautiful pity the movie is in black and white i can only imagine what they would look like in color the way the media are portrayed is absolutely hilarious there is no way on earth bridge will ever be like that it as soon as you can and tell your friends about it
i really liked this movie of course the idea is pretty much out federal government arranging to have a tracking device implanted into the jaw of an small-time thief to lure a more dangerous hacker out of hiding but alvin sanders the man who the feds have volunteered to be implanted with the device is a very likable person and it turns out to be a lot of fun getting in his head with him for a little while alvin even eventually proves himself to be much more than a good-humored but passive or one-dimensional character when he shows that he is not nearly as easily manipulated as he may seem definetly worth a watch
this is what makes me proud to be british this is by far the funniest thing on tv the league consists of jeremy dyson steve pemberton mark gatiss and the lovely reece shearsmith totally underrated this horror-comedy is perfection the characters are iconic and the catchphrases bizarre hello dave it is a comedy that everyone simply must best thing about the league of gentlemen is that it is always fresh and always pushing the boundaries it does not need to rely on little britain for it to be funny the fact that the league are willing to kill off arguably their most famous and iconic characters shows us that they've got balls of steel
before the devil knows you're dead is one of the best movies i've seen in time the acting excellent ensemble cast is incredible philip seymour hoffman putting in an outstanding performance and is electrifying every time on screen ethan hawke matches him scene for scene and albert finney simply chews up the screen marisa tomei is underused but looks amazing for her years the script is excellent the story-line non-linear but easy enough to follow sidney lumet although not known for his blockbusters has turned out a gem with this one
words are best experienced on paper the tales he weaves are gossemar silken strands of words and expressions that are not easily translated into a world of marilyn manson or jerry bruckheimer explosions his words have been treated well once before in the remarkable night is probably one of the three novels vonnegut has written i could take to a desert island along with and film version deserves a but the books are so permanently part of my interior landscape that i just can't do of the scenes left out of the film are part of my memory
since was only a toddler when this show originally aired i just recently picked up the dvd set and am wishing there were more episodes filmed this show was a version of the poplular tv series but with a bit more of a hearted approach but don't get me wrong some of these episodes have full on horror themes many in which have some pretty greuesome plots to the imagination of this was the early of the plots where a bit silly as well as the acting but that is the charm and attraction to this series whether you like mystery crime dramas comedies or themes this series brought all that together each episode clocked in at around minutes or so hour with commercials and that minutes goes by quick always leaving me wanting more a great classic show that is underrated in my book
this is easily a michel serrault known more for comic roles in the earlier part of his acting career does a stunning even worryingly stunning job of impersonating dr petiot a legendary french serial is just so believable at every and any moment in the film that the actor completely disappears behind the character only the very best ever achieve this feat and when they do it is only in a handful of parts at whole story real story which happened in century france is so powerful so sinister it makes for a very strong film that one remembers for a long long time
if you are a traveller if there is a fire burning into your heart if you'd call home every place on earth but none of them can give you enough if you are always looking for the next thing and if you believe the other part of your soul is somewhere out there see this movie and you'll find out a little but wonderful piece of life sitting next to you
the rookie was a wonderful movie about the second chances life holds for us and also puts an emotional thought over the audience making them realize that your dreams can come true if you loved remember the titans the rookie is the movie for you the feel good movie of the year and it is the perfect movie for all ages the rookie hits a major home run
well tenko is without doubt the best british television show ever the performances the directing the casting the suspense the drama everything is fantastic about the show fell a little later in its final season this ending movie picked up the threads nicely and wove a superb story for fans of the show and newbies i cannot recommend this movie more find it and watch it but i do advise watching the series first as the first seasons are even better than this fantastic obvious
i'm so glad i happened to see this video at the store i was looking for some happy movies and this one turned out to be a true gem i loved that the movie a love story of sorts wasn't about some beautiful twenty-somethings rather a story of some beautiful sixty-somethings who used used to be twenty-somethings a good well written and wonderfully acted story with fabulous wwii band music thrown in as well also got a delightful surprise in it for scottish castle lovers it left me smiling and ready to watch it again which i did a couple more times before i turned it in i highly recommend it
telefilms tend to fall under the pitfalls of a low budget and a hasty shooting schedule which is why this film always tends to buck the c scott embodies ebenezer scrooge perfectly fully encompassing all of his cold tendencies and still makes him a simpathetic character the production value for this film was exceptional never relying on boffo special effects or soundstage set-ups yet relying on the depth and clarity of on-site shooting and strong backdrops a movie that certainly stands alone
i simply never tire of watching freebird my husband was an extra so i was involved from the start have kept in touch with jon and have helped out with promoting the film both in cinemas and now the dvd release even to the extent of distributing promotional postcards on cross channel ferries and various places throughout france freebird was expertly written and directed with the perfect combination of fun and serious moments plus choice casting only phil daniels could fit the role of grouch great privilege to meet jon and the cast at the party following the premier in january anything else you want doing jon just ask either email or phone you know how to get me sue xx
an axellent second installment that manages to be just as good as the first again the casting is just wonderful i like how the first and second episode have nothing in common except for the wit and second episode is just very funny very silly and very enjoyable it is the very first christmas episode about a woman who is tormented by a serial killer dressed as santa after having killed her own husband just like the first episode most humorous scene is a tie between the murder of her husband and her phone call first faking her fear until it becomes real
except for an awkward scene this refreshing fairy tale fantasy has a fun and delightful undercurrent of adult cynical wit that charms its way into the audience as well as a soundtrack that powerfully moves this fairy epic along except for one of the robert deniro scenes that doesn't come across smooth and appears out of sync with the tone of the rest of the movie this luscious romantic fairy tail has a great storytelling feel and the strong magic and the fine balance between serious adventure scenes and the lighter spiritual humor is well done in the updated tradition of the princess bride this contemporary presentation of magic and love is captivating eight out of ten stars
this was a great romantic comedy historically inaccurate had no nieces or nephews as noted elsewhere in imdb but he made a great matchmaker he brought together two very nice people played by two of the best actors working the supporting cast jacobi joseph maher gene saks stephen fry etc all clicked on screen and made this a great viewing experience the fact he drove a car to get around seems to contradict all those images and posters of him riding a bicycle to get around and did he wear socks in one the professor never wore socks new entries for the imdb goofs section historical inaccuracies and inconsistencies aside this was a great movie to watch with a great cast i give it an
this was a highly original decent movie and a brave move for all those involved i don't care if not the most well put-together movie of all time the fact that it has eddie murphy doing something non-formulaic and that i don't know what will happen next makes it a favorite of mine i wish more movies were as imaginative as this one rather than the same old formula for entertainment
i just saw this movie the other day when i rented it and i thought this was going to be just another movie with a girl trying to prove a point but diane joined boxing because she wanted to i thought this movie was good i gave it a how good it is plus a movie with michelle rodriguez is always good even is been in only six
europa is a masterpiece that gives the viewer the excitement that must have come with the birth of the narrative film nearly a century ago this film is truly unique and a work of genius the camerawork and the editing are brilliant and combined with the narrative tropes of alienation used in the film creates an eerie and unforgettable cinematic participation of barbara suwkowa and eddie constantine in the cast are two guilty pleasures that should be seen and enjoyed max von sydow provides his great voice as the one of a kind movie four stars rating
in my opinion is a sweet charming and hilarious romantic comedy about finding the right person for you if you ask me james fry really was a dull guy to me ed robbins was more suited for catherine ryan than james was anyway everyone involved in this film did an absolutely outstanding job now in conclusion i highly recommend this sweet charming and hilarious romantic comedy about finding the right person for you to any tim robbins or meg ryan fan who hasn't seen it you're in for lots of laughter so go to the video store rent it or buy it kick back with a friend and watch it

this movie is more lupin then most especially coming from funimation other then the bad dub it isn't first hour is a lot like the comic is what all lupin the stuff is based on trying to get a huge treasure using weakness to women to try to get something out of it the last bit isn't that bad with another women but of course still him number lot of the other lupin movies are more family with cuss words then lupin any good lupin fan i think will be pleasantly surprised know i was after hearing so many bad things about this movie it might be a bit better without the little animations rolling during the credits make it a little mushy but overall it isn't a bad film good enough to be one of the few i'd watch again of the lupin iii movies
val kilmer and dylan mcdermott are terrific i have seen kilmer on the doors however his interpretation of john holmes is superb nothing compared to boogie nights which was kind of slow wonderland is a movie which is able to show you a horrible crime story from the perspective from a guy who is just indulged in his drug vice and indolent of what ever happens around at the same time the john holmes character shows a very clever hustler who is able to pass through the nastiest and ugliest situations almost unharmed the movie deserves being watched more than once the seventies ambiance sensual and full of drugs is amazing
hollow point though clumsy in places manages to be an extremely endearing and amusing action primary entertainment value here is humor everyone turns in clever performances that provide the film with a great deal of by the way advocates of gun safety will be horrified by the conduct of the characters in this movie
just watched the film for the time and enjoyed lindsay crouse and the rest of the cast just as much as before it just keeps getting better and better you simply have to marvel at the carefully measured way of speech the slow deliberate action everything being exactly in one of the great ones and definitely my all-time favourite

this shorter movie is the epitome the expected results when the imbecile runs the asylum it is sad how the futures of these young people were rolled down a craps table when neither saddam hussein nor the people of iraq god rest the souls of the plus that have been killed had anything to do with terrorism nor this movie the astute viewer will need to pick up or download a copy of loose change this movie is available free on the internet until the bush cabal locks it down by googling-up the very title as indicated in save our country this will not be done by following the christo-fascists that controlled the halls of congress for over years prior to november
has there ever been a movie more charming than this one of the reasons everything works so well is that the group of actors really seem to interact and have an effect on each lives the center of it is the romance of james stewart and margaret sullavan who work together and can't get along face to face but who completely connect with each other anonymously as pen pals but there are also supporting characters and unlike a lot of romantic comedies you've got mail the recent update of shop they're not just whipped up to support the two leads and their needs everyone gets to be an intricate part of ernst rich tapestry of charm one of the most heartwarming scenes in movie history takes place when the near-tragic frank morgan casually and humbly searches for someone to have christmas dinner with a must see out of
fully deserving its prestigious hollywood award nomination this is an entertaining little gem with lots of pizazz and some delightful surprises outstandingly funny scenes include an hilarious shoot re-shoot of a trench scene with australian comedian clyde cook as an optimistic non-com and the hapless mcdoakes as a messenger all under the beady eye of ralph delightfully irascible anguish a lost mcdoakes guided and re-guided by equally perplexed jack carson assistant director chandler rejoicing in a mcdoakes-sent opportunity i'm going to be a director comic o'hanlon has a dual role playing both mcdoakes and himself playing mcdoakes oddly richard l bare who does play himself in one or more other entries in the series has turned down that opportunity here in real life a youngish six-foot rock hudson lookalike but here impersonated by veteran actor movies jack mower
one of the most unheralded great works of animation though it makes the most sophisticated use of the cut-out method of animation la south park the real talent behind twice upon a time are the vocal characterizations with lorenzo from rhoda woody allen-ish ralph-the-all-purpose-animal being the centerpiece the accidental nightmare sequence is doubtless one of the best pieces of animation ever filmed
i liked this movie a lot the animation was well done and the romance was cute i liked most of bryan adams songs and the hans zimmer score was excellent what a lot of people don't realize is how well it relates to the heart of now themes happens when so-called civilization invades someone elses home what does it mean to be civilized etc the opening scenery and music were very stirring the film is a lament to an america that was once beautiful
this movie will go down down in history as one of the greats right along side of citizen kane casablanca and on the waterfront someone please convince leno to do a sequel leno and morita are a comedy duo the likes of which haven't been seen since abbot and costello the evil that emanates from chris sarandon tom noonan and randall tex cobb will give you the chills character as the buffoonish oaf hearkens back to the days of comedies and the climax my goodness the climax i won't ruin it for you but it makes the explosion of the death star pale in comparison if you can track down this hard-to-find gem do yourself and your family a favor and buy it immediately i'm still holding out hope for a special edition dvd one of these days
the groove tube was one of only two ken shapiro movies the other one being the equally zany modern problems this one is just a full-scale parody of tv aside from shapiro who apparently didn't do anything after modern problems the movie also stars chevy chase and henry cousin richard belzer the three cast members some other people in smaller roles appear in various skits one of the funniest ones features chase in a geritol-spoofing commercial in which describing the medicine as his wife strips and it ends with her humping him also a pornographic news program an irritating cooking show and the epic tale of some drug the whole just a real hoot in my opinion the three best tv-spoofing movies are this one plus tunnelvision and kentucky fried movie i might also include the truman show really wonder what ever did become of ken shapiro
i saw the grudge yesterday and wow i was really scared a good thing i love horror-movies and i really liked this one there were so many the english word that made you jump in your seat though too much screaming from the audience made it difficult not to laugh i think the most scary scene was on the bus when the face flashes by on the window or when walking without her chin the make-up is also very good sometimes you could really see it was there but it was still adding a freaky look to the scene the boy was very good indeed so cute without make-up and so terribly scary with it on the next time i hear a cracking noise i will probably feel pretty scared
probably bigas finest achievement for it achieves a delicate balance between sleaze eroticism and surrealism the delicious mathilda may who spent most of tobe lifeforce in the buff is the object of young biel pre-teen lust he can't get breasts out of his mind and wants so badly to suckle them and suckle the breasts of his own mother too his pursuit of may is the film as in luna works such as lulu and jamon jamon the director brings a slightly warped sexual sensibility to his strange but beautiful tale the usual suspects will be offended but those with open minds will enjoy this frothy erotic poem to the female breast josé luis images are gorgeous and nicola score is sweet and rich a gorgeous cinematic confection with a delightfully anarchic sensibility that the spanish do so naturally
until i saw this special on hbo i had never heard of eddie izzard i sure am glad that i have now he is one of the funniest comedians i have ever seen rarely has a comedian immersed himself so completely in his craft then eddie i could not stop laughing for the entire show if you like to laugh you have to see this special
i saw this in the theater and i instantly thought that it is good enough to own on video i am a big nut for sci-fi action flicks though giving any of the story away it is worth seeing if you like sci-fi without requiring much thought the story is basic and the plot is very good worth your time to they will make a sequel out of
wow one of the greatest movies i have ever ever loved it before the opening credits were done i was glued to the a sci-fi thriller and edge of your seat whodunnit wish'd it would never liu is a throwaway role anyone could have played it the lead actor jeremy northram was the perfect geeky guy movie appeals to me who loved war games sneakers and track walt d in lv
the whole does not even come close to the sum of the parts no problem this film features a line-up of some of the most diversely creative directors of our time and some really famous names in the cast the segments are devised around the same theme love in paris but the resemblance ends there actually considering that the approach to the theme from all these different directors takes so many forms it is amazing that we can even feel we are still watching the same film no great effort has been made to turn it into a comprehensive whole this buffet has so many great ingredients i am glad nobody tried to put them all in a single dish
one of the best amitabh comeback movies i liked this was the phase when govinda was going strong with dhawan the songs were awesome and totally as we call it masti type an evergreen entertainer with the likes of the multifaceted anupam kher chipping in the story line has a lot of hilarious twists and turns as is known for david potboilers with a timely appearance by nene dixit it was a total riot towards the end it was great to see amit perform with such force and humor after a long exile although some may consider it a typical bollywood masala movie i would watch it any day i am giving it an easy out of just for being pure bollywood
in my opinion october sky is one of the best movies of totally has everything an emotional drama movie would need like wonderful story and good character interactions october sky will remain in heart for as long as i can remember and i just have to say a very special thanks to those who have created this film
i really liked this film when it was released and i still do because the storyline makes you feel hopeful about life in general and people of the things i like about the films of lawrence kasdan in addition to the positive vibes from the film there are other reasons to like grand canyon for one thing it has an outstanding kline and danny glover for example in my opinion crash the highly acclaimed film that won the oscar for best picture was very similar to this film the difference is that grand canyon leaves you feeling positive crash had the opposite effect with me it was very dark i would choose grand canyon over crash any day
okay this movie is a pure pleasure it has the ever so violent horror mixed with a little suspense and a lot of black comedy the dentist really starts to loose his mind and enjoyable to watch him do so this movie is for certain people though either you'll completely love it or you will totally hate it a good movie to rent and watch when you don't got anything else to do also recommended psycho iii
i just read the plot summary and it is the worst one i have ever read it does not do justice to this incredible movie for an example of a good summary read the listing at turner classic movies anyway this was one of my favorite movies as a young child my sister and i couldn't wait until every april when we could see it on it is one of the best horse movies of time it is one of those great classics that the whole family can watch the romance is clean and endearing the story line is interesting and the songs are great they don't make movies like this anymore good acting and not over the top pat boone and shirley jones are at their best along with many other great character actors
i think you would have to be from the usa to get a lot of the jokes but if you liked princess bride and forest gump you would like this movie you can't compare the quality of the filming to those of course but having the cameraman trip was obviously done on purpose killer tomatoes is a hundred times better than nepolean dynamite just my opinion i'm sure that people from france would not appreciate the caricatures of the french so this film isn't for a world audience and while i am not a trained film critic i know what i like i couldn't stop laughing through the whole movie my sides and my jaws were hurting at the end of the movie
this film is a great example of fine storytelling the acting is superb the story is inspiring without being overly manipulative or fake there were a couple points where they probably made people a tad more good or bad than they really were but considering it is a hollywood movie they showed amazing restraint there wasn't a single explosion shown in the movie even though they had one opportunity to the film while having suspenseful parts was not made into an action movie the story is thus made to focus on an extraordinary man in unfortunately ordinary times well done
loved it but still have nightmares over the hotel movie was presented well with the choice of actors carrying their roles to reality of the writing many scenes gripped the imagination and created a nail biter the progression of situations were cleverly me believe the story was headed one way only to find a new twist on what i thought might be the obvious too bad there have to be have told many friends to watch for further showings and i of course will view enjoyed the scenery of the film and felt this added to the plots and intrigue husband and wife heated should i say fights were very initial situation is a common one but the escalation into the story presented fortunately is want to thank all who were involved in this great entertainment film thank you looking forward to the next whidbey
i just saw this film on turner classic movies last night and was blown away by victor every sense of the word a tour de force the atmosphere of dublin evoked through the cinematography and production design really foreshadowed techniques used in the best film noirs of the and early nice attention to detail frankie wake the mourners are all praying in gaelic max score is unforgettable as in later films such as gwtw he appropriated folk ballads to lend local color and a sense of place and time john ford already a film giant in
this is really a great unknown dialogue without the typical movie relied on the talent and it was pulled even had a little bit a comedy in it wasn't in the life is what a crime drama is supposed to the typical special affects garbage with sex thrown especially loved the interracial aspects of it onto the actors themselves laurence fishburne was superb at playing a career petty a shame that only allowed to show his talent in his own movie titus welliver was fabulous as junky half-brother eamonn walker added flavor to the already perfectly spiced film paul calderon was perfect as a grease loved his acting since king of new york but the best acting in this film came from gregory hines and michael paul were paired perfectly as two of in the life is for sure a keeper out of
i like many die-hard trekkers trekkies i don't care suffered through seven seasons of star trek voyager dreaming of a better show when it was over lamenting the end of deep space nine in prayers answered enterprise is fantastic fresh perspective radically different characters stunning new visuals a pop-song for the intro was shocked i can't think of anything i didn't like sign me up for seasons of this show star trek is back voyager nobody misses you keep on
this is a great story of family loyalty which thankfully doesn't resort to the usual tricks at least the ones i'm used to seeing in american and european films of supersentimentality or high dramatic very watchable and very lovable it has some beautiful cinematography but doesn't rely on that alone to entertain
great documentary about the lives of ny firefighters during the worst terrorist attack of all time that reason alone is why this should be a must see collectors item what shocked me was not only the attacks but fat diet and physical appearance of some of these firefighters i think a lot of doctors would agree with me the physical shape they were in some of these firefighters would not of made it to the floor carrying over lbs of gear having said that i now have a greater respect for firefighters and i realize becoming a firefighter is a life altering job the french have a history of making great and that is what this is a great documentary
netflix should mention this short feature on the info for silk stockings superior in every way to that over-produced fluff this had much better cole porter songs and lots more energy silk stockings turned out to be a big disappointment fred was getting too old for this sort of thing though the dances and cyd are lovely i will be on the watch for the douglas version of ninotchka was peter lorre ill during the making of silk seems to be very passive in the more active numbers and with less lines very glad that i ran across by pure accident made the whole experience a lot more enjoyable bob hope as a simple song and dance man is pure joy
simply well written directed and acted best of the if not his best since the hugh jackman was the perfect pick for his roll scarlett banter with woody proves how well rounded an actress she has refreshing to not being in a romance on screen with the leading lady he plays the perfect bumbling have been a few reviews maligning this movie don't let them stop you from seeing the wonderfully done film people in the crowd i saw this with were laughing so loud at some lines i missed the next line if you like woody allen films of the you'll regret missing this suggest you go to watch this film with an open mind if you do you might walk out smiling
at movie seems so bad that i almost fell in a trance the first time i saw was like a bad cosmic i gave it a second another and finally got addicted to this to dreamlike slow natural in a mellow autumn light and especially the musical is made of some progressive rock and absolute exquisite folk songs by derek should notice the song about hazel trout and lady vanishing in the in the middle and near the end of the are some carnal scenes in the beginning wich allow us to appreciate the natural charms of elizabeth that movie had been made by some repertoire directors like von triers or jean-luc would have rolled on the about that movie as if it were a cosmic personally think this film is one million times superior to any of cinematic not for the pretentious
i was all ready to pan this episode seeing that this master really doesn't have any horror films under his belt but this is easily the best episode of the acting was good i don't know how he wrangled it but we've got some real talent in this episode and while you could see things coming from a mile away plot wise at least it was entertaining and managed to keep me engaged for the full mins something that has been lacking up to this point in the especially liked the bit at the end not a twist per say but just a funny little bit where he becomes as ever the hen-pecked good effort like i've said in other these are not true masters doing a lot of these episodes but they may someday end up being masters in the future
i was very moved by the story and because i am going through something similar with my own parents i really connected it is so easy to forget that someone whose body is failing was once vibrant and passionate and then the mistakes they made and have to live with i loved ellen performance and who is christine horne fantastic a real find there is probably the most erotic scene i've ever seen in a film yet nothing was shown it was just so beautifully done overall the look and feel of the film was stunning a real emotional journey cole hauser is very very good in this picture he humanizes a man spiraling downwards i liked the way the filmmaker approached this life never sentimental never too much just enough to hook us in but not enough to bog down
when it comes to paul verhoeven and erotic thrillers most people think of basic instinct and some maybe of showgirls but verhoeven has made his best erotic thriller years before these two movies de vierde man this film is mesmerizing and mindblowing and above all the story is absolutely plausible which makes the whole experience even more intense the performances by jeroen krabbe renee soutendijk and thom hoffman are exceptional and direction does the rest de vierde man makes even basic instinct look quite tame it can't get much better than this a true classic of erotic nightmare cinema out of at least
for is one of the best movies i ever through life and proving himself he isn't just an ordinary cookie carl brashear is an amazing character to play who puts cuba in his best performance in his is a living legend gives that something to the his character in he gives so much good acting to this appearance of beautiful charlize was and as always is a big plus for every movie so if you haven't seen this movie i highly recommended for those who love who seek must look this great drama my vote
the main reason i wanted to see this movie was because of the wonderful cast a ton of my favorite actors in one movie equals amazing with out actually seeing it but this movie caught me off guard it wasn't what i was expecting at all been a while since i've seen it but i do remember i could not stop laughing and it wasn't just the cast that did it for me the script was amazingly written every time you were expecting something to happen it didn't happen there were so many twists and turns but it fit with the whole tone of the movie instead of coming off as pretentious the cinematography along with the set was absolutely beautiful as well i really can't say anything bad about this movie expcept i would have andrew davoli a little more screen time
you got to go and dig those holes holes only leaves troble which makes a movie so good disney has done it labeouf should be nominated for best actor for his performance as stanley yelnats he has alredy won the daytime emmy for best actor in a comedy series stevens holes is one of the best movies in
an our gang comedy gang coerces spanky into watching their younger siblings caring for these forgotten babies turns out to be quite a chore leaving the little nipper with no choice but to come up with some ingenious solutions to the baby-sitting is in his glory in this hilarious little film arguably his best highlight retelling the plot of the tarzan movie recently seen to the audience of infants movie mavens will recognize billy voice in the radio drama
i don't see how you can say that nightmares is cheesy and a rip-off you obviously don't know good tv when you see it the episodes are packed with drama and blood freddy is creative in the way he kills people i love nightmares and i hope to get all episodes on dvd the best episodes are saturday night daze and love stinks if you think this series sucked then you're entitled to your opinion but remember only your opinion and it means nothing nightmares will always be one of the best series ever and you'll come to accept that fact soon enough if you don't like it then don't watch it but don't deny brilliance
a great gangster mendes has directed this beautiful movie showing another father-son star-cast leading with tom sullivan has done a terrific acting by him is an acting acting too from paul law and daniel is just too plot is quite will enjoy the great portrayal of the gangster of the in the will surely stand out as the zenith of all gangster movies of that is pretty good an apt to the great flick in totality showing what a father does to protect his underrated for my a fully deserved
i have loved this movie all of my life such an intelligent story also with plenty of classical allusions eg the ship that went missing decades earlier was called the bellerophon well in classical mythology this was the man who slew the chimera a legendary beast composed of two or more other creatures in fp walter pidgeon is clearly the himself and his id monster like movies where the writers have clearly credited their audiences with a modicum of intelligence unlike most modern blockbusters which spend on special effects but about on a
the perfect space fantasy film a group of kids go up accidentally in space and have to get back down but do they sure they would not be a family film if they all died then it will all be sad you don't want that kate capsaw the leading lady gives a golden globe performance but sadly she nor lea thompson won one that sucks so can't say it enough this film is so great lea o lord a perfect girl for this film this film is the best for sure but better than star wars star wars is so rated and space camp was so rated it should of been the other way maybe iam not good at math
the movie held my interest mainly because dianne keaton is my favorite actress i disagree with some of the other posts on the grounds that the plot was not convoluted i had no trouble following it some people had too much eggnog the night before the movie was very sad and touching as well what more do you want alexa davalos is a fine new talent too and tom everett scott does an excellent job with his part as well the relationship of the mother and daughter may have been a bit unrealistic but the behavior of the young people in the movie was not it was tragically sad but enlightening it sure beat the other shows that were on tv new years day evening
huge exhaustive and passionate summary of american cinema as seen through the eyes of martin scorcese needless to say there is never a dull moment in all of its hour running time many genres periods and directors are all examined discussed more from the perspective of cinephile rather than contemporary director for anyone even remotely interested in american films or cinema in general a masterpiece and the best of the century of cinema
earth is a must see for children and adults my son had great fun watching all these funny birds and ice bears we can learn a lot from this movie and we should be proud on our great treasure on earth there are some animals in danger to disappear exactly that problem should prevent all the authorities of our planet documentary offers many exceptional pictures that i have never seen before then it is well accompanied by a heavenly music the director did a great job here that gets high respect nothing can stop me and my family to give earth the highest rate i hope so much that the stuff will create a sequel
i was electrified when i first saw this in or steven biko is gone half way through the film but the resonance of his courage and wisdom is not forgotten i didn't when finally in south africa in it is also largely a story about friendship and loyalty when i was in south africa and heard the audience at a dance recital in natal sing nkosi sikelel iafrika my hair stood on its ends there is a lot to learn from this story for all peoples
holly is an issue-driven film but it is neither manipulative nor overly sentimental at its heart is it is a character-driven film which wouldn't be nearly so successful without the fleshed-out portrayals of patrick livingston the lost soul with the gradually awakening conscience and holly nguyen the strong-willed but ultimately over-matched young vietnamese girl from the vibrant locations and photography to the effective editing everything is forthright and well-done the contemporary classical score may put some off at first but it is top-notch composition and underscores the admirable restraint which is evident throughout this film which raises many issues but provides few clear-cut answers ultimately succeeds in raising awareness of and compassion for holly and the many who share her plight kudos to those who managed to get it made
this may not be war peace but the two academy noms wouldn't have been forthcoming if it weren't for the genius of james wong is one of the few films i've fallen in love with as a child and gone back to without dissatisfaction whether you have any interest in what it offers fictively or not is a visual not saying his best work i'm no expert there for sure but the look of this movie is amazing i love everything about it elsa lanchester the cat the crazy hoo-doo the retro-downtown-ness but the way it was put on film is even like the inconsistencies pointed out on this page above and the special effects that seem backward now it all creates a really consistent world
like a streetcar named desire directed by gadg both on stage and screen panic in the streets depicts a new orleans in which its major claim to fame the birthplace of jazz doesn't even rate a mention it was richard seventh film and arguably went a long way to establishing him as the fine actor he really was rather than merely a psychotic killer gadg himself appears in an uncredited small role as a morgue attendant but the film is rich in talent beginning with jack palance being billed as walter jack the local mr big followed side-kick zero mostel barbara bel geddes emile meyer tommy rettig plus the rock-solid ever reliable paul douglas as the cop who comes round to doc point of view a very rewarding movie more so for being little seen catch it if you can
i moved out here to get away from this kind of thing the small town sheriff happens a lot in chicago his deputy no not really the plot is that a group of martians mistake a halloween rebroadcast of orson welles war of the worlds as an account of a real martian invasion and conclude they need to get in on the action what follows are a bunch of mishaps involving the haphazard attempts to conquer the town of big bean il everyone concludes they are kids in really good costumes except for the daughter and her friend a kid in a duck martians themselves are comical and you get the impression they are no threat to anyone but themselves pretty early on a fun family movie
the film is exceptional in gay iconography and extends this beyond the asthetics to the music and cast throughout the whole film exists a childlike wonder as seen through the eyes of the main character her lighthearted take on the world around us is comical and beautiful in a way a slacker movie for girls watch this is you fancy a relaxing entertaining mid-night movie buy this if you like diferent takes on the world of media and love combined

in this glorious telling of a weekend shared among literary greats mary and percy byron and others created a entrancing group showing their quests for sexual enlightenment personal freedoms from political to moral liberal drug use for both stimulations and as addiction their creative views of life and writing describing without boring the viewer how each writer seeks to find their muse along with the distractions and affections each share with breathtaking scenery that does not detract but very much enhances the story well created characters from grim to loving then angry to peaceful with some of the most lovely and scene enhancing costuming to be had
this movie was very good because it remember when i was young when i maked snow castle it was so fun this movie is interessant this is a good quebeker movie with no much money and is also a magical movie because their wonderfull castle is very big and beautiful
i took a chance on hardcastle and mccormick by purchasing the first worth release from amazon when i got it i started with the pilot and i was instantly hooked after that i rated it stars on amazon and i am rating it stars here it is just that good what i liked about it were the opening and closing themes and of course stephen j logo at the end of each episode but most of all the relationship between the judge and mark as they worked together to crack each case i was so hooked that i also purchased the second season as a companion and i enjoyed it equally if you do not have this excellent series on disc i believe that you should purchase it and put it in your collection
i saw this movie when i was in israel for the summer my hebrew is not fluent so the subtitles were very useful i didn't feel lost at any point in the movie you tend to get used to subtitles after about movie blew me away it depicts two of the most prominent taboos in the middle east today a homosexual relationship between an israeli and a palestinian it allows a person to enter both realms of the conflict simultaneously the dilemma the emotions entailed the movie climaxes in tragedy when anger and rage drive one of the lovers to one extremist side an absolute must see
how can anyone not love this movie i think a hilarious spoof of all the old gangster movies if you've never seen them watch this instead michael keaton has a ball in this role as anything goes one guy mangles the english language everytime he talks and griffin dunn plays a clueless but my favorite role has got to be joe piscopo he has all the best lines danny devito alan hale ray walston are in this star-studded movie that lampoons gangsters a lot funnier than mafia did for the criminal underground
i saw this movie with my dad i must have been pretty young around it was on star movies one movie started a bit vaguely but you could tell those robbers were gathering up for a score it really caught pace after the first half the actors are great especially blades and lou diamond i guess the ensemble they just play so well together i can watch this film think it is the relative stupidity of the plot and the characters trying to deal with a very weird score the jokes are not corny but they are subtle and extreme at the same time that make them so perfect comedy for a lazy afternoon
what can i say that hasn't been said about the haunting it has everything that would make a great picture wonderful sets moody music and sound design to die for were all in place the screenplay though sometimes boggles the mind in such a weird surrealistic way the entire team must have forgotten to read it through maybe because they were too busy creating cg effects and building gothic sets to notice how weak the plot was each member of the cast gives a worthy performance although with little conviction to the material at hand lili taylor has the most to do while the others mostly react to her but about it all i can say is that it was a slightly enjoyable two hours but you will definitely want more a lot more

goodnight mister tom is so beautifully filmed and beautifully realised it isn't completely faithful to the book but does it have to be no not at all john thaw is mesmerising as tom oakley his transformation from gruff to caring was so well realised making it more believable than scrooge in christmas carol after inspector morse this is finest hour he was matched earnestly by a young nick robinson who gave a thoroughly convincing portrayal of an evacuee traumatised by the abusive relationship with his mother the script and music made it worth the buy and you also see thaw playing the organ amazing the most moving scene was willie finding out about death and then tom telling him about his deceased family who died of scarlatina buy this you'll love it bethany cox
fear of a black hat is a hilarious spoof of hip-hop culture it is just as funny as this is spinal tap if not funnier the actors are incredible and the documentary style is superb mark christopher lawrence is a tremendous talent that should be starring in a lot more films this film is a true cult classic
this made-for-tv film is a brilliant one this is probably the best and favourite role by bafta winning john thaw and inspector morse tom oakley widowed man has lived in a village alone for a while since his wife and son died and now he has been landed with an evacuee called willaim beech robinson as he gets to know this child he starts to develop a friendship until mum apsion wants him back after tom gets worried about william not contacting him he goes to london to find him in the end willaim gets his home with a loving family dad set during the second world war this is an excellent film it was nominated the bafta lew grade award and it won the national television award for most popular drama john thaw was number on greatest stars very good
adorable i saw domestic import in philly in october with my kids we all liked it so much that we saw it a second time with my parents i haven't heard them laugh like that in years it was the first time that i can remember seeing a movie that my parents and my kids could enjoy really cute and we can't wait for it to come out on dvd they need to make more movies like domestic import it is refreshing to go to a movie that three different generations can enjoy not be embarrassed i have not seen a movie this cute since my big fat greek wedding i loved mindy sterling as the mother she was also in austin powers howard hesseman is in this too and he is hilarious i remember him from wkrp
four words account for why this film was made she done him wrong the huge commercial success of that mae west vehicle convinced the studio brass that gay melodramas were a viable proposition here we are rewarded with a fast moving well written romp which neatly targets the personalities of its beery and george raft are excellent as friendly rivals jackie cooper is a little harder to take but it is fay wray who steals the film with her stock-in-trade damsel in distress with a strong director as walsh proves himself to be wray could carry a lot of punch and she is utterly believable as the object of both raft and of atmosphere beautifully designed this is a forgotten film worthy of revival
walter matthau and george burns just work so well together the acidity of willy with the perplexed amnesic al is a mixture made in heaven the scene when they meet again in flat is a gem and the final scene rounds up the film to perfection walter matthau gives a superb performance as the irascible semi-retired comedian as only he can the intonation in the voice and the exaggerated dramatics coupled with his general misunderstanding of what is going on form a great characterization george burns timing is legendary and nowhere was it better than in this film his calm aplomb with desert dry replies are memorable watch for the scene near the end when al and his daughter ask something of the spanish caretaker and reaction priceless
i drove from sacramento to san francisco back to see this movie really glad i did as a big movie fan and a life-long northern californian i was surprised how many oscar-winning films have been made in the bay area as a fashion designer who really wants to stay in the bay area as opposed to going to la george lucas comments about persistence community and having a vision really resonated with me if he and all the other filmmakers can make it in sf so can other artists recommend this film
this is one a most famous movies of the french sexual empowerment of the seventies starring gerard depardieu and patrick dewaere in extremely sarcastic roles it is also one of the many dark psychological dramas of the such as serie noire buffet froid beau pere all realized by i would like to correct the previous comment that was posted on the movie the translated title in english is very far from the french version it is true that both protagonists are going places but the title in french could be literally translated by the waltz dancers which is a metaphor for the movement of the testicles
in ten words or less to describe this film barbara stanwyck is too appealing and it is great the film is wonderful except for the perhaps tacked-on ending but i love happy endings anyway barbara stanwyck however as the platinum-blonde gold-digger is amazing she knows what she wants and goes after it this film is sexy and excellent
this film is stunningly beautiful art really benefits with the medium of film because you can see the art at its most beautiful moving and changing and blossoming i strongly recommend this movie to everyone i can think of nothing else to say about it just the kind of movie you have to see because so visually compelling and left me very refreshed when i left the theatre
an absolutely brilliant show the second season began where the first ended with much mystery suspense in most if not all episodes and mystery everywhere one that made me think and think again truly amazing how the writer can come out with all the connections and link all the characters together and combine all these elements to make the lives of the characters in the show so meaningful never fail to excites and i am looking forward to the new season hopefully more secrets will be reveal and at the same time more mystery to be solved good selection of cast too for this show fit the characters perfectly really can't wait to finally discover the secret hopefully all the hype won't spoil the ending
my all-time favorite movie oscar-caliber work by everyone involved both in front of and behind the camera the screenplay is perfect and works out the relationship between lady caroline and george briggs in a completely satisfying way unlike the novel the care with which the other leading characters have been drawn is a tribute to screen writer peter barnes and the intense visual beauty should have won oscars for director mike newell and cinematographer rex maidment it is josie best work by far and transformed my opinion of joan plowright having watched this movie at least times i can find no fault in it the music by famed composer richard rodney bennet is a marvel
there is so much of worth in this movie that it is hard to know where to begin with praise let me begin by expressing my admiration for a perfect portrayal by reese witherspoon that her performance stands out in the excellent cast is praise indeed robert mulligan has seldom disappointed those of us who have admired his work every frame of the man in the moon is evidence of film making at its best
this was one of the most moving movies i have ever seen i was about years old when i watched it for the first time and whenever it is on tv i my eyes are glued to it the acting and plot are amazing it seems so true to reality and it touches on so many controversial topics i recommend this movie to anyone interested in a good drama
ok i overrated it just a bit to offset at least one of those grumpy reviews but i did enjoy it i didn't laugh out loud but it held my interest and pulled me along without dropping me at any point the story built yeah you knew it would have an happy genre always does meantime it was quirky with sight gags you could miss so pay attention when you watch stiller and black delivered expertly yet again good team they should work together more don't know that it will be a cult classic but it was certainly a fun ride not as good as what about bob or dirty rotten scoundrels but what is it is still worth going out of your way a little to get and watch this movie
why a good actress like elizabeth berkley stars in this commonplace movie the cast gives some good performance berkley as a barbie girl ele keats as a girl without mother and justin whalin a guy eternally lessened by his bother but the direction is extremely boring and the story is not so interesting and original i can not believe that a movie like this was produced for the big screen julie corman producer are you crazy
i must confess to not having read the original m r james story although i have read many of his other supernatural tales i've also seen most of the previous bbc christmas ghost stories and this one in my opinion surpasses most of them only equalling the can't really fault a view from a hill the direction and mood is perfect as is the acting lighting and of course the story and writing i thoroughly enjoyed this and can only hope for more of this quality from the same director and production team i understand that the bbc plan to make some more necessarily based on m r james stories so
magicians is a wonderful ride from start to finish thanks in large part to the magic that is generated by the stars alan arkin is fantastic in one of his best roles in decades like any really fine film a journey in which the theme is redemption and the results of dreaming i can't believe this film is so difficult to find i'd buy it on dvd in a heartbeat but have yet to find an outlet
if you fast forward through the horrible singing you will find a classic fairy tale underneath christopher walken is very humorous and surprisingly good in the role his trademark style of acting works well for the sly puss in boots the other actors are well for their parts i did not find any of the acting terribly fake or awkward the king in particular appears a real dunce though and i wonder if he is supposed to be i can not remember the original tale the special effects are typical of the eighties but at least they are not overly fake like some of the computer generated fare that we see today overall i recommend this movie for children and adults who are a child at heart
an excellent and accurate film mcgovern takes great pains to research and document his writing and it pays off he is not afraid to tell the truth even though it might draw unfavourable reviews and comments from some who like stories to be clean and sweet and again mcgovern brings in christopher eccleston though not in as high a profile a role as he played in hillsborough i found this movie as accurate well acted and well presented as hillsborough and i applaud mcgovern for his poignant unapologetic writing well done and my hat is off to the writer the actors the production crew a great film
i don't know what the previous reviewer was watching but i guess what reviews are personal taste missed in this movie was the depth a very deep film many layers of emotion affecting undercurrents of withheld love because of submission to societal beliefs taboos of the times and classes race relations not being in a very good state of equality guilt yearning hate confusion very dark emotionally i thought under the skin you have to submit to the aire of it a flowing movie not slow as stated before release yourself to the flow of the film the emotions will show themselves characters reveal their flaws their nasty insides excellent and actually very cruel
red skelton was still another major star who made the transition from movies to television with shows certainly brought a laughter to the american households of years would begin the show with an opening monologue afterwards we would have a variety of characters remember gertrude and heathcliff in the monologue how can we ever forget san fernando red i remember one episode where as a king red introduced his queen by referring to her as your know that red would use his comedic talents to really hide from his tragic life he lost a son to leukemia at age or so his wife georgia died by suicide
bend it like beckham is a film that got very little exposure here in the united states it was probably due to the fact that the movie was strongly british in dialogue and terminology and dealt a lot with football here which some may have trouble relating too in the unfortunate because this movie is absolutely fantastic and deserved much more coverage over here i think the basis of the storyline a dream is something many people can relate to and in the end bend it like beckham proves to be a good-feeling film with a source of inspiration and really good acting i was not overly excited about seeing this film initially but now i regret not seeing it sooner i highly recommend this movie
yes shakespeare would indeed have been proud laurence fishburne was not at his best but certainly not bad kenneth brannagh on the other hand was brilliant his scheming was wonderful as was his toying with the audience very nice were at times too little drama where more would have been expected slaying for instance was a bit clouded by too much happening to far apart causing the spectator to twist his head to grasp it i mention michael maloney his madness striken roderigo was unusual annoying you haven't seen othello before see this if you haven't read othello see this if you haven't heard othello see this you do on the other hand do yourself a favour by reading it seeing it acted onstage and hearing it sung too
john flamingos pecker is the best movie i've seen in a while it gives the viewer a surreal image of life in baltimore live in nearby washington dc with a warhol-like use of color exaggerated motions and emotions pecker becomes larger than his town can handle and he is separated from his loved-ones a sexy ricci by his man-loving art manager the picture left a refreshing taste in my of like a fresh strawberry ice cream on a hot summer though this taste was rather flat and simplistic it only made the whole thing more profound and critical it is a celebration of life liberty and the right to bear everything else this country stands for pieczanski
i liked this film very much the story jumps back and forth quite a bit and is not easy to follow there is no resolution to the story whatsoever and you are left to wonder what really happened since i like that sort of film i enjoyed this i especially like the dating scenes between the boys and i was drawn into their lives and of course any film with a naked staphane rideau will get a couple of extra points
this show has a great storyline very believable a mans wife dies and he cant take care of his children alone so he calls on his brother in law his best friend and many others come later on in the show such as rebeecca donaldson the lovable yet strong dog comet nikki and alex who you can find out for yourself don't want to spoil it for you and of coerce kimmy gibler sidekick of dj but the kids are wonderful too this is mary kate and ashley first took off and also you may know candace cameron bure from shows like punky brewster and so raven jodie sweetin plays steph the love able middle child who feels left out really this is a very good show
not knowing what this film was about i checked it out at the video store and after seeing it i enjoyed it little seen multi-genre flick from director bernard rose immortal beloved great story and characters as a fan of glenne i was surprised of her british accent the only exception for this film was the ending however it is worth the rent
when i saw the exterminators of year at first time i had no expectations for that movie although it wasn't so bad as i was thought kind of italian version of roadwarrior with cast that is almost famous in italy including venantino venantini behind the story is elisa briganti and dardano sacchetti who are also responsible for story of zombie flesh-eaters you can also see other links to italian horror movies luca venantini plays the role of tommy and you can see that kid in paura nella citta dei morti viventi of the living dead aka gates of hell as john robbins and in cannibal apocalypse as the role of brother quite entertaining movie with some dull parts
this movie is just great entertaining from beginning to the end you're always gonna be at the edge of your seat throughout the entire movie in my opinion this movie is highly underrated by the suits perfectly into the role of the well trained mountain-rescue guy gabe walker together with him michael rooker makes a great appearance as hal tucker and then john lithgow one of the best performances i've seen of him as a the fact that of the movie takes place at a mountain with a whole lot of bad guys on it makes way for a lot of action movie
i've seen the original english version on video choice of voice actors looks very promising i can't believe i'm saying that the story is about a young boy who meets a girl with a history that is intertwined with his own the two are thrown into one of the most fun and intriguing storylines in any animated film the animation quality is excellent if you've seen job of delivery service you can see the quality in their production it almost redeems them for stealing the story of kimba the white lion not quite finally films are being released properly i can't wait to see an uncut english version of nausicaa
cusack does his best david niven in this one although i don't know if anyone besides me noticed seen with this in mind its a deliciously over saturated wants to be taken more seriously than austin powers but still be pretty funny reworking of an under-appreciated comedy duff does an over sexualized britney spears lap dance version of mata bond the writers built a little reverse oedipus twist into the plot interesting never knew how soothing voice was until this movie i think he has found a new calling doing nav system voice overs
i found about the movie holes by hearing from people that it wasn't typical disney that both kids and adults both got into the story folks let me tell you i wasn't disappointed holes is based on the novel by louis sachar and follows the adventure of stanley yelnats a boy who gets sent to a strange juvenile detention camp out in the desert he befriends a boy nicknamed zero and together they set out on adventure that changes their lives it was a very interesting unique different and funny story i didn't know quite what to expect when i watched it it was interesting to see the story come together like pieces of a puzzle the boys who played the juvenile delinquents were all very funny and jon voight was just hilarious as mr sir now that i've seen the movie i have to read the book most recommended
i've long wanted to see this film being a fan of both peter cushing and david mccallum i agree that the romantic sub-plot was a waste of time but the talent of mccallum shines through this juvie role thank heavens for turner classic which aired the show last week i can imagine that there were lots of problems with children after the war especially with the way things were throughout the some of the boys are a bit scary i certainly wouldn't want to met them on a well-lit street much less a dark one there were some good insights regarding the feelings of a firebug as well or as they call him a firefly
this movie was a fascinating look at creole culture and society that few african americans are aware my own two children are by products of a paternal grandmother whose father was a member of the gens de couleur libre and a black skin woman whose parents were ex-slaves he married outside of and against his culture and was cut off from all of his family except for one sister who took pity on her brothers plight raising children during the great depression of providing the family with food whenever she could of course she clandestinely aided this family fearing for her own ex-communication my daughter was fascinated by the movie we have made it a part of our library
i think it unfortunate that the leading comments on this movie include the words clueless and appalling nonsense i think it is a very funny movie and excellent entertainment one has to suspend disbelief that a homosexual man and a lesbian woman could fall in love have a child and live together happily ever after but it is always wonderful to see it played out in a movie and have heart warmed is it so impossible there are far more implausible events described in other movies the acting is good the script is funny the only negative comment is that the story could well have ended when the family drives away from its initial house instead of extending on to explore whether the man retains any residual homosexuality
i just don't understand why this movie is getting beat-up in here jeez it is mindless it isn't polished and it is i am reading wasted on some the cast of this movie plays their characters to the t you watched permanent midnight and became a ben stiller fan then yes you will be disappointed these are misunderstood well-intentioned misfits trying to save the with nothing but grit and determination the problem is they don't realize their limits until the big showdown and the point this is times the movie that the spy who shagged me was yet gets panned by the same demographic group likely the same people who feel the first ap movie pales in comparison to the sequel i just don't get it the jokes work on more then one level if you didn't get it i know what level you're at
when this first came out my dad brought it we were amazed by it was so different from anything we had seen before i was looking for a specific movie last night and i found the eye again the box is falling apart and i am surprised that the tape still works although it is not finding nemo quality graphics it is still very good they should sell this it is a landmark for computer animation imagery highly recommended
well-done ghost story that will give you the creeps and some pretty fair scares along the way the story unfolds slowly building atmosphere all the way until you're ready to see the woman in black you won't forget her once you've seen her no gore no knives no hockey a well-constructed story that is best viewed at night with the lights out
a young only director with great talent a powerful scenario young and ambitious cast with all theatrical of the first tries of a thriller in turkish cinema which seems in the future we'll have some more based on the on high definition video the movie is perhaps effected on world thrillers especially the american thrillers the technical and cinematographic character is quite well done the scenes are all well worked on not too much blood but sufficient enough to make you think you're in a blood bath scenario is quite wise but with certain clues a clever audience can easily predict going on and at the end when everything settles down you're getting somehow weird to conclude the done tiglon one of the biggest dvd distributors in turkey it is not easy to decide for such a movie in their first try as a production company
the historical accuracy might be questionable with the mass appeal of the inaccurate lotr such things are more easily excused now i liked the art ness of it though not really an art house film it does provide a little emotionally charged scenes from time to time have two complaints too short and the voice you hear whispering from time to time is not entertainment replayable
b movie yes diy yes first movie yes but aestheically this movie definitely had some bad etc problems however this movie has many positive things about it first off the most annoying character dies first second its made to be a b rated horror movie the comments our killer makes to his victims left me and my friends rolling around on the floor problem is a lot of people try to take every independent movie and expect it to be a masterpiece take it for what it is a bunch of kids right out of high school made their first movie for what it is just that it is really good
this is a very good movie do you want to know the real reasons why so many here are knocking this movie i will tell you in this movie you have a black criminal who outwits a white professor a black cop who tells the white professor he is wrong for defending the black criminal and the black cop turns out to be right thus making the white professor look stupid it always comes down to race this is an excellent movie pay no attention to the racist if you can get over that there are characters who are played by blacks in this movie who outsmart the white characters then you shouldn't have any problems enjoying this movie i recommended everyone to go see this movie
cary grant and myrna loy are perfectly cast as a middle class couple who want to build the house of their dreams it all starts out with reasonable plans and expectations both of which are blown to bits by countless complications and an explosion of the original are many great laughs if the story is somewhat thin sure to entertain fans of the stars or the late hollywood comedy style a definite highlight comes when a contractor goes through a run down of all expenses which must have sounded quite excessive to a audience as he makes his exit he assures the client that perhaps he could achieve a reduction of from the at least certainly hilarious
one of my favourite films first saw it when i was about which probably tells you a lot about the type of humour although dated the humour definitely has a charm about it expect to see the usual askey murdoch banter so popular in its day with lots of interesting quirky co-characters the lady with the parrot the couple due to get married and are in trouble from her and my favourite the stationmaster nobody knows where it comes from nobody knows where it goes interestingly the ghost train was written by arnold ridley of dads army fame godfrey the medic watch it on a rainy sunday afternoon after your lunch and smile
in this was my all-time favorite movie betty costumes were so ravishing that i wanted to grow up to be her and dress like that douglas fairbanks jr was irresistible as the dashing hungarian officer silly and fluffy as this movie might appear at first when i was eight years old it seemed to me to say something important about relations between men and women i saw it again the other day i was surprised to find that it still did
ok it was a good american pie erick stifler goes off to college with his buddy cooze during their arrival they meet up with cousin dwight the two pledge to become betas and along the way they get involved with a whole lot of sex tits and some hot girls along the way in a few words there is a lot more sex nudity and alcohol it is a good movie for those who want to enjoy an american pie movie granted it isn't as great as the first three is is a good movie if you enjoy hot girls with really nice tits get this movie if you enjoy seeing a bunch of dudes making assholes of themselves go to this movie if you want to see the full thing get the unrated addition one last thing this is a better attempt than the last two american pies
the movie was totally awesome and cool the graphics was superb and it was amazing especially flik was superb and awesome in the movie and he was funny and he was and sometimes he was intelligent the circus bugs are colorful and they are superb in the movie the grasshoppers were also superb and cool in the movie hopper was a pure and perfect villain even dot was cute when the bird comes to eat the bugs that scene was superb and good even the last scene was awesome and cool even inventions was good building an artificial bird was a good idea to scare away the grasshoppers when the ants are building the artificial bird that scene was good and nice i should really appreciate the creators of a life
billy wilder is co-credited for the story and his unsentimental touch is noticeable in this quite original tale of ghostwriting songwriters who both work for burnt-out music legend oliver courtney the obvious misunderstandings are gotten out of the way quite quickly thank heaven and what remains is a witty and breezy concoction with some fine songs some more forgettable ones crosby at his most charming a great turn by broadway legend mary martin and basil rathbone and oscar levant providing most of the cynical barbs is in rare form and his quips haven't dated at all a delightful surprise and recommended for all fans of the genre
this movie was a really great flick about something that affects us all i know i've personally run into this many times thank goodness will smith has jumped onto the societal issue of text messaging while driving people don't do it an hour and forty five minutes is not enough time for this cause personally i wanted to throw away my cell phone after the movie i was glad to see other people in the theater saw the message and dumped their phones with the empty bags of popcorn i decided to disable all text messaging on my phone and would encourage others to do the same if you care about your family make them watch this vital public service announcement on text messaging while driving or they could kill seven people thanks for showing us the way
not consider this having a spoiler but i'd rather be cautious than i never saw this movie when i was little i fell in love with it the first time i saw it with my three year old daughter i can watch it over and over the little acting ilene woods did in her lifetime she was a wonderful voice for cinderella very appealing very believable the music really fit the movie perfectly the acting was great loved the mice you really hated lady tremain and the step-sisters they were just awful the cartoonists depicted the spoiled behavior very is a wonderful movie especially if you are into love stories my daughter has seen the movie about times and still gets excited at the end
one of the great classic comedies not a slapstick comedy not a heavy drama a fun satirical film a buyers beware guide to a new with great characters all of whom cary grant is convinced are out to fleece him in the building of a dream great look at life in the late
a slight charming little movie to be sure but a superbly-crafted one gwyneth paltrow shines in this early showcase for her british accent and the cast assembled around her all lap up the dialogue this came out around the time of sense and sensibility and i'm sure i don't know why that one garnered all the oscar attention emma is jane most accessible and least stuffy story told well
this movie is one of my favourites it is a genre-mixture with ingredients of the some of the special effects may seem outdated compared to modern standards this minor flaw is easily ignored there is so much to discover in this story the romantic relation between the two main characters is so beautiful that it hurts the visuals are beautiful too the action is great which is no surprise it is originating from honkong birthplace of the best action movies the humour sometimes seems a little bit silly but in a good way somehow this movie is being able to balance the different moods and keeps being good absolutely recommended
a warm touching movie that has a fantasy-like burstyn is as always mathis has given many great performances but there is just something about this one will haunt your of all you've got to see this amazing old jodelle ferland i was so captivated by her presence i had to buy the movie so i could watch her again and again she is a miracle of by the high imdb rating i'm not the only one who was mesmerized by this young actress
maybe i'm a sap but this is the sweetest movies ever i saw it for the first time when i was around or and i cried my eyes out between then and now at age i have seen it over times and have sobbed each and every one of them don't worry they're tears of happiness and not all sap a lot of humor and comedy in it too usually the whole talking animal thing can be a huge drag but in this movie not the case my only word of advice even if you love this-don't see the i suggest everyone checks this won't be sorry no matter how old or young you are
first off i would just like to say what a big fan of bette i am stella is a very good movie with a wonderful cast midler john goodman trini alvarado stephen collins marsha mason this is one of my favorite films of all time it deals with a mother raising a child on her own she goes through a lot of things that are out of her way to bring up her daughter jenny played wonderfully by trini alvarado this movie is very good and i suggest that you pick up a copy to watch it roger ebert gave is stars and it deserved wonderful i give it out of
kim a witch on the prowl for a mortal lover and james her choice scintillating comedy of manners from the broadway stage shot by james wong howe in witch color and performed by a sterling cast ernie kovacs is wonderful as the perpetually dishevelled writer redlitch i love this movie though few others seem to kim alone makes it a winner in my book ha my film of
i thought this movie was a lot better than most movie critics are giving it credit for though it has its confusing parts of the plot it doesn't greatly interfere with your understanding of the movie that being said if you're not open to more liberal political ideas then this probably isn't the movie for you i thought all the actors in the movie were outstanding each character has their funny moments and the audience at the tribeca film festival was laughing throughout the whole thing i thought the satire was a tad over the top in one particular area but intentionally done john cusack is right in that although set in the future it really makes you see the present
of watching this as a child although i'll probably find it god-awful now it was kind-of spooky stuff as i was only seven or so i also recall working on a saturday-afternoon puzzle while watching it so i wasn't really paying much attention however the scene with the rolling boulders has been burnt into my mind ever since i've asked numerous people if they've seen this flick but to no avail years ago one person mentioned that possibly he had seen it but he thought it merely a dream a fanciful piffle like wind no dream my friend no dreaming now again i haven't seen it since then but i can't wait to find a copy and stuff it into my vcr anything that can stay embedded in my eye for years deserves a
this movie is one of the most underrated movie of its time when watching this movie your filled with action and when somethings not really happing the humour is un matched brilliant writing for a movie that was made to give us a bloody mix of a game show where criminals are the contestants and a near future where the general public all have a thirst for arnold doesn't let us down with some of his best one don't want to spoil anything for you but i will tell you when arnold gives his i'll be back line he gets the best response of them all in this movie hope you enjoy this gem as much as i did
this excellent drama had me in suspense the whole time i could not take my eyes off the screen for one second because every word kept connecting the pieces to this puzzling murder this movie really touched me because it showed how sad and hard life can be i really did cry in the end i don't want to give away it also let me realize how cruel and sickening people can be when it comes to murder cast was also very good the only bad cast member was the actress who played anne marie the actress did a great job but the director didn't i say this because he found someone who didn't look a single bit like anne marie fahey herself
this is a brilliant political satire no wonder why it was largely ignored in the it exposes our murderous foreign policy for what it really good film from this era rendition was also totally dismissed simply because it showed accurately that the is a war machine bent on torturing murdering and maiming civilians in its quest for total world clever plot good acting some big stars cusack ben kingsley marisa tomei anyone and some scenes of hilarity should have made this movie a hit unfortunately americans don't like to hear the truth about themselves especially when they are complicit in mass murder
i see a lot of really negative posts by people who wrote in august though the movie was not released in the us at least until the middle of september maybe these are unhappy expats living in s korea who saw it early i am in the us and just saw it today i thought the special effects were excellent better than the trailer the story was non-western but i think we are all used to this from many other movies it wasn't at all hard to follow the acting by the leads was weak but other people were quite good there was humor throughout too i rated it at because i had a good time watching it which is what i went for
i know a lot of people don't like this movie but i just think it is adorable not much i can say but the movie is a feel-good movie i guess the songs are beautiful the costumes are beautiful the voices are beautiful and there are a lot of funny lines in the movie especially as briggitta learns about the and of society if you like musicals i'd say you'd like this one
down to earth is the best movie it is so funny and really sweet too it has a good plot and unique it isn't like those movies that are all the same with the similar story lines and not all comedy and no story this movie also has a very good ending
it ran seasons but first in early and last in the autumn of were shorter than seasons cbs chief william paley canceled production after watching the show of season in september because he disliked the series without eric fleming as gil favor who had departed after season the last new episode aired in november the lone cbs broadcast on january was a rerun have often wondered why rawhide didn't switch to color filming for last season most of the big westerns of the had gone over to color by cbs was broadcasting in color that autumn for many of their sitcoms but westerns like gunsmoke and rawhide remained in black and white gunsmoke was the last western last prime time network series to switch to color on september for the episode snap decision
sidney stratton is having trouble maintaining jobs at various textile mills mainly because of his experimentation in the textile laboratories experimenting on a formula for a new fabric which would create the ultimate fabric one that never gets dirty never wrinkles or wears out when stratton eventually creates the fabric he creates enemies in all the textile workers will lose their jobs and the owners will lose money since one mill has the exclusive rights so stratton in his white suit becomes the most hunted man in england the film is ideal and only ealing could have made it so guiness performance a great supporting cast such as greenwood thesiger and parker and direction make the film a delight but the real hero is the story itself a nice satire on business and industry with additional elements of drama romance and suspense rating
this one-minute film is arguably the first movie ever made other inventors had previously filmed actions like motion photography of a sneeze but the lumiere brothers developed equipment that tremendously advanced the medium at the time of course their must have bewildered their peers including their subjects in this first instance the brothers record employees leaving their factory some of whom understandably struggle to hide their awareness of the camera the lumieres attempt to make the film more entertaining by introducing animals and a bicycle but sortie des usines lumiere doesn't nearly match the ingenuity of their later films the most interesting aspect of this short film is the brothers selection of a familiar working class ritual as their subject their choice is the initial evidence of their curiosity about all of the people a quality that makes viewing their experiments immensely rewarding and fascinating
hot millions is a great movie in every way a fun offbeat story with wonderful performances by four of the best professionals ever to work in the business peter ustinov is brilliant as usual and maggie one of the greatest actresses of all is a total delight karl malden and bob newhart round out the cast and are also perfect if you want a movie that has perfect casting this is it what is so impressive is the way these people work off each other in such a natural and effortless way creating lots of laughs and fun moments throughout peter ustinov was a genius with a wonderful sense of humor and this is one of his most memorable performances the direction photography and editing are also first-rate and a great time capsule of london in the definitely on my all-time favorites list
amongst the standard one liner type action films where acting and logic are checked at the door this movie is at the top of the class if the person in charge of casting were to have put good actors in this flick it would have been richard dawson who actually did act well if you can call playing yourself acting i love this movie the running man is in all likelihood gift to maybe just men definitely the most quotable movie of our time so i'll part you with my favorite line all part of rich pattern brenda and you better get used to it ahh more people have been called brenda for the sake of quoting this film than i can possibly imagine
simple story why say more it nails premise world war kills all or most of the human race and we're viewing of the survivors the message is that the warring sides should not have been at odds in the first place distilled down to representatives from each side we see they have everything to come together finding resources food shelter etc survival the end they've decided to pool their resources finally does so they will survive simple story expressed in the limited budget of the early television landscape we see it in as somewhat old and maybe predictable in the early no one had seen such stuff i give it a
watching the fox and the child was an intoxicating experience the lush visuals integrity of point of view and utter beauty of the setting and characters left me in a swoon of plot is uncomplicated deceptively simple within the container of that simplicity a world unfolds that draws you in and leaves you laughed i wept i is a movie you can trust yourself to give yourself over to dare i say it is an act of love intended for any innocent heart it reaches to the heart of the any reveals the world through new eyes as if seen from the da samraj once said that true art draws the viewer beyond point of view into ecstatic participation in reality i feel i have been privileged to to participate film a work of true art
i was also on hand for the premiere in toronto this film was sort of a consolation when i thought i wouldn't be able to get in to see my first choice well i was totally blown away by the time i got to the theater i could remember little other than the basic plot of the movie i actually forgot who was even in it terrific performances from the entire cast carrie-anne moss was great in a true departure from her days as trinity as for billy connolly i think not since chaplin has an actor played so brilliantly with no lines what-so-ever the kids were also great definitely check this one out if you get the by the way i got to see my first choice and this was way better
yes it may be goofy and may not seem as funny as many high budget comedies out there but this movie is truly hilarious if you really watch it tim meadows has always struck me as being funny off of the saturday night live show whenever he would do this character on the show i would crack up laughing so after i saw this was going to be playing on comedy central one night i decided to check it out all in all i was farily impressed with this movie because it wasn't meant to win any oscars or become comedy of the year but it did entertain the saturday night live fans that love the ladies man character this movie is also packed with some highly quotable lines that can be recited for years to come
there is no doubt that halloween is by far one of the best films ever not only in its genre but also love the films creepy atmosphere like the whole it could happen here sort of situation makes it scary to think to imagine if you were ever in this situation what would you is a movie that i enjoy watching highly especially around halloween carpenter is a very professional directer i love a lot of his other films but there is no doubt that his best known movie is the film and if your thinking about watching the rob zombie remake is pure crap and a true halloween fan would like the john carpenter version myers is one of the coolest slasher killers in any film and is a very well known by all means go see this masterpiece you will really like it
i first saw this as a child living in east london the scars of hitlers luftwaffe were all too evident and the landscape of the movie was reminiscent of our street i remember having nightmares after seeing it the odd thing is it really hasn't dated if viewed as a piece of social history in cinema fiction from a globally destructive war the scale of the machines was badly awry more nano-technology now but overall an excellent and well-crafted work it was interesting to see how space travel was perceived back then i would think that firing a spacecraft from a gigantic gun would almost certainly kill the astronauts however much was right mans desire for war mans inhumanity to man the means of war as a catalyst for development
this western is done in a different manner than most others realism is the key here conchata farrell comes to wyoming to work for rip torn on his ranch how this is presented makes for a most interesting slice of americana i would have preferred to see this on the big screen rather than on tape but worth a look to see just how life was back in the real west cinematography is excellent solid torn farrell excel in this movie
bruce almighty one of best pictures since well a long time it contains one of the funniest scenes i have seen for a long time too morgan freeman plays god well and even chips in a few jokes that are surprisingly funny it contains one or two romantic moments that are a bit boring but over all a great movie with some funny scenes the best scene in it is where jim is messing up the anchor rating
i really like this film when i started to watch it i thought i would get bored pretty soon but it surprised me i thought it was a great film and have seen it a few times now the characters are believable and i have to say that i fell in love with brian austin green all over again first time being beverly hills i would recommend this film if you are a fan of his but i do agree with another comment made earlier that the ending is sort of disappointing i would have loved it to turn out a little different never mind though good gripping story
not being a poet myself i have no real way to convey the beauty and simplicity of this documentary the effortless motion of goldsworthy as he molds natures beauty into his own work is captivating watch him stick reeds together in a web hanging from a tree in a close up for a few minutes while he speaks of his work and then receive the payoff when the camera cuts to the wide shot be amazed by the ease with which he operates and then realize the futility when a slight breeze knocks down the entire genius of goldsworthy seemingly knows no bounds as his inspiration is nature itself it is in the essential change of nature where his work though complete in its own sphere is made whole
a lovely movie it deeply reflects the chinese underground bands current lives if you chinese culture traditionaled rock n roll music there you go i will highly recommend this one but one thing i am wondering is whether this movie has been showed in mainland i sorta doubt it d
this was a fantastic episode i saw a clip from it on youtube and i vowed that should it ever show on tv i would glue myself to the set in order to watch i wound up watching it with a friend of mine who happens to be gay and the two of us cried at the end this was a truly well-written heartfelt episode of the forbidden love between two cops who i felt really were words the lucky ones it is episodes like this one that really make cold case one of the most captivating and much-loved works of television magic on cbs i anxiously await more episodes and a re-run of forever blue because i will always watch it again and again
an enjoyable game which offers fun and easy game play and fair replay ability staying true to the comic and providing a low learning curve gives this game something not seen in most action cartridges today also the narration and animated scenes used lengthy animations are replaced by slide shows on the nintendo version use full advantage of the platforms capabilities
i know some people think the movie is boring but i disagree it is a biography of a very complex and extraordinary person i liked the characters in the film and think that leaving parts of life a mystery captured his humanity i don't think the purpose of a good biography should be the detailing of life but rather the complexities and relationships that make them interesting and what is more fascinating than someone so successfully reinventing themselves men become what they dream you have dreamed well good job to lord attenborough i also wanted to mention that nathaniel arcand really stood out to me as a charismatic actor and i hope to see him in more films
the best cheech chong movie so far of all the cheech and chong this is most certain the best so far i think i've seen them all about twelve times at least and i love them all but this is most definitely the best compared with the others this one covers a lot of themes and gives you a lot of good laughs part of the texts are still part of our language today after years i hope that one day they can make another one because they still are great comedians i heard they are writing a new script so who knows i guess these guys are the only ones who succeeded in making decent movies in this genre i wonder if john ashcroft ever watched one of them
a very interesting entertainment with the charm of the old movies tarzan faces the greatest perils without hesitation if the moment requires it and we all enjoy with him his most insteresting for me is a man without special powers facing the problems and beating them just with human skills was a great swimmer and had a great shout
it is a great movie if you have ever named your cars or are really into old fast or exotic cars it has a plot and a lot of action the car scenes are great except for the totally fake car jump scene all of the other scenes are great i really enjoyed it and i hope everyone else does as well
i actually quite enjoyed this show even as a youngster i was interested in all sports and that included horse racing it was always going to be difficult to make a series based on racing corruption and at the same time get permission from the race tracks to record filming about this controversial subject one episode i particularly remember centred around a horse expected to win a big race that looked a bit off colour a syringe was found on the stable floor and everyone thought it had been drugged but nothing showed up in the blood tests all too late they realised the horse hadnt been doped but had had its knee cartilage removed like running a car with no oil and the engine seizing up the horse broke down with tragic consequences
this movie has an all star cast john candy richard lewis ornella mutti cybill shepard and jim belushi to name a few run amuck in monte carlo as well as some other beautiful european locations and is very funny the trouble that everyone gets in when they lie to protect themselves is great and i highly recommend that you see this movie it is well worth it john candy is in top form in once upon a crime as is everyone else if you and your family are looking for a great family film this is your ticket everyone gives stellar performances great acting great comedy and great timing which is rare in movies these days great plot great mystery i love anyways and overall well worth the money you spend on it so get the kids grab some popcorn juice or tea or sodas and enjoy the show
o my gosh just give me a minute to breath this movie takes you on an awesome ride and doesn't let you go until the very last blow in your face ending this is the the movie for fans of stormriders and such legend of zu was beautifully created although i didn't like a few things they used alot of stand ins i wanted to see the real person fight but oh well a few small let i didn't really like it a lot until i watched it again when you understand it more it totally kicks i encourage anyone who ever wanted to see a true asian movie to see this movie i give this movie one of my highest and see it when it comes out in america
turned out to be a classy production with what must have been a low budget the variety of characters is amazing from axe-wielding dwarfs to ghouls i enjoyed the relationship between the leads not overly sentimental but romantic enough to keep the interest going i also enjoyed the mix of humour can be very easy to get wrong too enough which meant it didn't get too dark nor too spoofy it was a great step up from eaves other efforts hellbreeder and sanitarium in terms of storyline and production they have a great website which is worth checking out can't wait for bane if the level of improvement continues it should be fantastic
i love this movie i mean the story may not be the best but the dancing most certainly makes up for it you get to know a little bit about each character the way they want you to learn about them i just think that you won't like this movie unless you're into broadway
for my opinion the middle of the film specially the love scene is a bit too long but the whole time you can imagine this desert feeling but the best what made this film unforgettable are the great explosion pictures their color slowmotion and the pink floyd music are unique in in its propper and popular form
i felt this film throughout i waas impressed with russell talent in developing his relationship with lillie such a typical aussie blend of softly softly approach a bit self depreciating and very persistent really loved the cinematography and direction pace was just right and the portrayals of nearly all characters was didn't talent even in shine and i have yet to see gladiator
five deadly venoms is not as bloody and violent as story of ricky or super ninjas but it features some of the best hand-to-hand fight sequences in hong kong film history director chang cheh creates what is considered by many to be his masterpiece this movie launched the careers of the five men who play the venoms meng lo plays yet another bad ass he would go on to be in super ninjas kuo chui who is philip kwok would go on to story of ricky and hard boiled any chop socky fan can apperciate this but i still think it ain't as good as super ninjas made by chang cheh but all chop socky is good and this is one of the very best
this is a ripsnorting old-fashioned adventure yarn i understand that by political standards the treatment of the indians was unacceptable but this moving isn't about politics about action dialogue comradery acting direction music and photography and marvelous on all these factors grant fairbanks and mclaglen are electric together and jaffe is superb this is the ultimate buddy movie
this is the kind of film you want to see with a glass of wine the fire on and with your feet up it doesn't require that much brain-power to follow so is very good after a long day i would say it is very unrealistic if you expecting anything serious then don't bother but it is very funny just the thought that a businessman would go so far as to agree to live in a slum for a while and then actually get to enjoy it i would definitely recommend it
i had heard some not too good things about this movie and had probably seen the low score here at imdb and why i had avoided it today they showed vanilla sky on tv and as i had nothing better to do and as it turned out i would have had a hard time finding anything better to do vanilla sky is a frightening sad and touching movie actually one of the best i've seen in a while i was surprised by how i was affected watching it hard to explain but during the movie your feelings towards the characters and your perception of what is going on changes and quite an emotional journey vanilla sky really touched me in a way that is very rare for a movie or any media for that really recommend everyone to watch this movie regardless of what you have heard about it
what would happened when a depressed cop works with a shrink on probation may be a lot of fun this movie set a benchmark in the genre of the argentinean cinema dearable characters probable story and a pace that between laughs has some thrill i recommended it for a pleasant time of entertaining peretti and luque join their efforts to fight against a cold and daringly foe in a time when difficult to trust someone this movie will surprise you the other side of the coin of analyze me but not alike with nothing to envy and if you like to know there where few scenes of downtown and the city center
perhaps the best isabel book house of the spirits describes an alternative chilean history this one full of magic a mystic veil plus some kind of omnipresent sadness this movie gathers a great cast plus a great art direction with a script that cannot contain all this quality unusual for a nearly unknown country like chile to get so well represented as it is by this movie whose perhaps only sin is to aim too high and because of that left the illiterate public a little upset mostly because they understood very little
sure this movie wasn't like blocks inside man an american haunting it was a great mystery that can happen to anyone of us i found this movie really great and live exactly where they filmed this movie san pedro california and we have heard true stories based on incidents of this dunno if you've heard of the famous boat in long beach queen mary well that boat is haunted i believe in spirts illusions and parallel or however u spell that is real in there own the mind is a powerful recommend to watch this movie great and not bad directing at those who rate it a they don't understand the film its meaning its plot its view and how bad the ocean life can be for each and everyone of
a great flick parker posey is fabulous in this story about the nightlife in manhattan that requires so much cash posey gives an amazing performance as a librarian and a night crawler this is a good light movie for saturday night before you go out the soundtrack rocks the outfits are out of this world the script is funny and the actors do a great job the redeeming value you can make it in this world if you try just find your niche i believe parker posey is the perfect actress for this kind of character young fabulous and broke must look up the movie clockwatchers if you watch party girl you are bound to have a good time enjoy
dont read any plot summaries because in words the plot might seem trivial brain-dead and pointless the film is excellent the acting by both denzel and dakota will go sky high trust me on just fabulous and the plot is mind blowing actually fabulous is a small word to use for such talented actors the film is just based on actual facts and some characters are not fictional a fact that adds up to the shock that i was having during and after the film if you are fond of both actors and of somewhat deranged films you still haven't watched your favorite one me in the end you will have a weird and inexplicable feeling the film is awesome see it rent it buy it or don't miss it
in this installment of the series edmund blackadder is stuck in the regency period in britain the later portion of george rule this time prospects are much instead of royalty a servant to the very very thick george iv price regent unlike the historical accounts of george iv this one is about as bright as a tomato and as a result able to take advantage of him and scheme to his content the only major difference in style between this one and earlier ones is that the series ends on a very very very different just have to see it to believe it other than that all the usual story elements are there and the show is hilarious the only reservation i have always is that this show is not appropriate for the kids due to its crude language and adult situations
this is like crouching tiger hidden dragon in a more surreal fantasy setting with incredible special effects and computer generated imagery that would put industrial light and magic to shame the plot may be hard to follow but that is the nature of translating chinese folklore to the screen certainly the overall story would probably be more familiar to its native audience however an intelligent person should be able to keep up moreover the martial arts scenes potency are amplified by eye popping cgi
i saw this movie on the bifff festival in brussel spring what a surprise this german production a stylish and imaginative shocker is one of the scariest flic i have seen be warned this is not a joke this terrorizer has a big cast of good actors an martell as a european guru has a strong presence excellent direction nice production design a very good soundtrack and a lot of heavy gore sfx like italian horror movies in the eighties flesh ripped clean to the the blood runs red this savage heart stopper will grip give you some dark dreams a must-see
george cukor directs a brooding and cynical classic the distinctive ronald coleman is at his best in this piece of noir about an actor who loses himself in his roles the acclaimed anthony driven his wife with his highly fueled temper and erratic behavior but the two manage to continue working together to please their audiences things begin to change as john is becoming bored with his career he reluctantly agrees to play othello he gets deep into character as a jealous and murderous man he begins walking a thin line between illusion and reality and ends up confusing his role with his own life and eventually kills his has no memory of the dastardly seems faultless in this role winters is very impressive as the young woman determined to get away from her squalid life also in the cast edmond o'brien ray collins joe sawyer and whit bissell
this is one of my favorite films of all time i read the book and liked it but this movie expands on everything the book made famous the acting is fantastic especially from jon voight who plays mr sir a very evil character this film has a certain way of storytelling that keeps you hooked throughout until the end where everything is pulled together for a great ending i also love the way this is directed by flashing back and forth between the modern day and ancestors stories the story was written by louis sachar yes but it seems that this story is made for film and andrew davis does a great job directing it i definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys good movies
i have never commented on a film before i watched this movie with my girlfriend last night i've read comments saying this movie stays with you it does been almost hours and i am still completely affected this movie left me questioning my own self how can i possibly compare myself to a character such as ben who is totally selfless i loved this movie i love movies that keep me guessing and wondering until the end i feel two emotions predominantly happiness and sadness an amazing feel good movie and a very sad one too i so wanted ben and emily to be together but in the end they were forever if you haven't seen this movie get it and watch it just make sure you have no distractions you'll want to see every nuance in this picture one for my library
wow finally jim carrey has returned from the died this movie had me laughing and crying it also sends a message that we should all know and learn from jeniffer aniston was great she will finally have a hit movie under her belt if you liked liar liar you will love this movie i give it
i first saw this movie about years ago and have never forgotten it beautifully filmed and the story keeps one riveted for the entire time difficult to believe this was made in as the tale is still fresh today and really makes one think i'm not very knowledgeable regarding film technique however the special effects in this film are terrific considering when this was made in addition the acting is superb and the use of english and american actors quite astounding i recently purchased the dvd so now i'm able to watch whenever i wish i highly recommend anyone interested in post-war british films to watch this
the synopsis for this movie does a great job at explaining what to expect a very good thriller well shot tough to believe it was bill directorial debut though some shots do look exactly like a storyboard version there are a few shots that really look good and show some real imagination on the part of paxton a solid story with some great twists at the end several of them all believable all fun and best of all obscured well enough to make them true twists child actors in the movie do a great too i'm usually wary of movies with kids in starring roles because all too often they come off as nickelodeon rejects but both these kids do a good movie is not gory not very scary but it is very very creepy
ingrid bergman is a temporarily impoverished polish countess in paris who finds herself pursued by most popular general and a glamorous count and on top of being engaged to a shoe magnate such is the failproof premise that entrains one of the most delirious plots in movie history there are backroom political machinations by the handlers a downed balloonist and ecstatic bastille day throngs but the heart of this gorgeously photographed film is the frantic intrigues involving randy servants and only slightly more restrained aristocrats yes rules of the game redux before all over even gaston modot the jealous gamekeeper in rules puts in an appearance as a gypsy capo no less things happen a little too thick and fast toward the end resulting in some confusion for this non-french speaker but what the heck elena and her men is another deeply humane renoir masterpiece
this a superb self-contained work that is unconnected with anything before or after brat pack crooning and club exclusivity are not my biscuits of choice but in this law-free world they make an alluring ambiance the film is packed with our guys distinctive actors who add distinction to this work with winning performances the dialogue is a joy in fact a new vernacular one of the few films that can be watched repeatedly with deepening include billy british loutishness ben vulturine brassware squirmishness and the survey of ad hoc philosophies
i saw this movie when i was a child it blew me away this was before the days of television so a movie of this magnitude could send a young kid into orbit it so impressed me that i went to see this movie for twelve consecutive days the special effects used at this time were far ahead of its time sabu was a real delight as was rex ingram as the genie i found myself singing i want to be a sailor for months after the film left town i would recommend this movie to any and everyone i forgot to mention conrad veidt who was as villainous a character as you'd ever want to meet also june duprez was never lovelier than she was in this picture the color was outstanding give this movie an aaa
this is an excellent film about a traditional working class family in northern england filmed on location in bolton it stars james mason as the father who is the dominant force within his home or so it seems cleverly the film based on the play portrays the complexities of family life the supporting cast is terrific as well with many familiar faces lending support
i just came back from a pre-release viewing of this excellent sci-fi film noire style is definitively unique and very well made it is filmed with actual actors but transformed into a black and white comic-strip style you have never seen before it goes one step further than sin city and it does it well a successful combination of french comic and movie cultures the story and mood remind of blade runner and if you liked that one you will surely like this one too the storyline is intelligent never boring and has some nice little twists this film is a must-see for any cinephile except perhaps those who absolutely don't like sci-fi or
i thought hugh o'conor was astounding as the young christy brown and really deserved greater recognition for his role i couldn't believe how well he played the part of course daniel day-lewis was brilliant too my favourite scene is where the boys are playing football and christy uses his head to stop the goals and then kicks the penalty amazing performances by the two christys other also
not wishing to give away here i would just say this technically excellent flawlessly acted and uplifting little flic will reward the viewer with an excellent hour and a entertainment it will amuse surprise possibly embarrass occasionally and almost certainly tug at the heartstrings from time to time as it approaches the inevitable but not obvious ending without becoming clichéd or predictable in any way most definitely previous comment gives out of for the film and out of for both branagh and outstanding performances i agree entirely
i'm surprised how many people give this move less than they just don't understand the story is about growing up in a difficult is a crazy grandmother who really wants the best for your good reason why so many critics like this the reason is because they understand the feel sorry for the low scores given by some wish i could just write a brief summary of a movie but imdb requires you to write frankly don't have anything else to say
the kennel murder case starts off at a run and doesn't stop until the very end everybody had reason to kill the victim and several people tried william powell is terrific as philo vance gentleman detective mary astor is refreshing as the put-upon niece who only wants to marry her scottish gentleman and enjoy her inheritance this movie comes paired with nancy drew reporter on dvd which is also fun if you have to rent the disc check it out from your local library do it pure entertainment
while browsing the internet for previous sale prices i ran across these comments why are they all so serious just a movie and not pornographic i acquired this short film from my parents years ago and have always been totally delighted with it i've shown it to many of my friends they all loved it too i feel privileged to own this original black and white silent film of shirley before she became popular or well known after reading the other comments i agree that the film is racy big deal i only wish it was longer it seems that i must be the only person who owns one of these originals for sale at least so i wonder how much worth
so fox pulled the plug midway through a lame is that do they expect us to invest our time in their new shows when there is a realistic risk of never finding out what happens why weren't the remaining already filmed episodes aired in the us they were broadcast fox are you listening this was a great show but you left us hanging if you're going to introduce new at least air a conclusion before abruptly ending mid-theme every time something like this happens it seems to happen a lot with you fox there are more of those who will wait and see before investing their time this means you will see an artificially low interest share and are more likely to end the series see it is a vicious cycle don't let us down again
this low budget digital video film has strengths in the right and acting in addition the digital photography is the best of the lot so far in low light conditions the characteristic video umber tone prevails but surprising it rivals film stock for brightness clarity and saturation in brightly lit situations this is grass roots film making at its best with snappy dialogue carrying a midnight cowboy kind of story about grifters doing whatever it takes to survive in urban san francisco
no rubbish no where even near rubbish not an original thats the last thing that could be said of certainly not although it was somewhat an unusual series for the bbc it was hilarious funny and witty i particularly liked belinda lang and john pickard who i believe preformed olsen was also very good and so were all the other cast never quite new why it was can-celled till reading here today about gary death at a relatively young age i do wish that they would make more of comedy of this type much more of them show them here in way up
sudden impact is the of the dirty harry films and one of the best traits of these films is that they don't really degrade in quality from one film to the next thus sudden impact provides another thrill ride through the life of dirty harry callahan this time harry attempts to solve a series of murders while on vacation always on the job it seems clint eastwood plays harry as he plays all his men of action slow deliberate and without fear as the first of the dirty harry films to be made in the sudden impact lacks a bit of the feel that characterizes the first three films this doesn't mean that quality is any less bottom line brimming with intensity and action sudden impact is another worthy addition to the dirty harry series
i first saw a track from this dvd at a hifi show nov in london i was not really into cream until was through a high end arcam sounded great with had to get this dvd and i'll tell you this is by far the most exciting music dvd i have ever performance of cream at their age was just mind blowing and sound quality is the best i have heard on a music does not matter what type of music you one will definitely grow on the sheer brilliance of their performance that will make you watch it again and new musicians don't cut the mustard these days as these old rockers do
the title of this film nearly put me off watching it not being a manchester united fan the mere mention of beckham was a bit off putting however i put my prejudices behind me and i'm glad i wasn't expecting much of a film but i was pleasantly surprised the film sped along with me never looking at my watch and i enjoyed every second of the film if you liked east is east then you'll love this film ok so the storyline is nothing new and the classic storylines are contained within the film but all done very funnily and with a breath of fresh air the film moves very fast and keeps the audiance entertained the occaisional funny moments are a good chuckle and not some poor attempt at humour and best of all a good british comedy
based on an actual mining disaster this early german talkie english subtitles still remains one of the most effective docu-dramas ever filmed featuring many non-professional actors kameradschaft gives a chilling view of the friendship that binds the mine workers regardless of which side of the border they may be from a deadly accident brings out the very best in everyone nullifying any superiors orders a fellow miner in need will receive the help of his comrades even at threat of great loss including film reminds of the self-sacrificing heroism shown by the nyfd following the attacks putting aside any formal rules and regulations these men and women in uniform knew only one cause to save lives and to find their fellow-fire fighters more than years later kameradschaft still has the strong and timeless message a friend in need is a friend in deed
kusturika made it again another masterpiece a coral comedy full of his own landmarks with a frenetic rhythm and many glorious moments we laughed and laughed what a party the music is everywhere and also the shooting the animals the crazy bastards sex and amazing gadgets and inventions everything colorfully visual to entertain only pure cinema in essence a wonderful experience to watch and one is specially grateful since good comedies are so rare and so wonderful well this is one and if you enjoyed previous films you'll love this although as in all comedies it is about a chemical reaction and you have to be in the mood for it
this movie re-wrote film history in every way no one cares what anyone thinks about this movie because it transcends criticism every flaw in the movie is easily overcome by the many amazing things the movie has going for it it is an extremely beautiful movie and i doubt many of us will see anything like it again i've seen it more times than i care to count and i still become transfixed every time with a feeling which is hard to describe one for the ages
this movie is a it is pretty is a good on the true story of how a bunch of norwegian saboturs managed to stop the heavy water production in rukjan norway and the deliverance of the rest of the heavy water to movie isn't perfect and it could have been a bit better the best part of the movie is that some of the saboturs are played by you're interested in history of wwii and film this is a movie worth a look
he is the quintessential narcissist and manipulator in this case portraying attorney murderer tom morris is sympathetic as victim anne marie fahey but in the beginning is a bit too much the victim we are sorry for the situation but become simultaneously disgusted after seeing his victimization of several other women rachel ward as sad part is where she is actually getting help with her self-esteem issues and capano actually had her psychologist killed pretty hard to believe but this was based on a true is a cameo with olympia dukakis as mother all in all an interesting story because it is based on a true murder and you will want to read ann book to get the accurate details
what a surprisingly good movie this one turned out to be this is the type of film that i've been looking for ages particularly important for me was the fantastic-looking chicago which i still keep thinking about the back cover doesn't do this film justice superb and in my for sure
hamlet is by far my favorite of all of works branaugh is one heck of an actor his portrayal of this was just amazing his soliloquies were breathtaking for as long as it was it is rare for a film to hold my interest however i was engrossed in this particular piece i recommend this to anyone both fan of shakespeare and those not so much this has everything the modern world looks for in its films murder betrayal and deceit not to knock mel version but branaughs touches the whole work this leaves no stone unturned when you finish the film it will feel as if you read the play yourself um how you say two thumbs up
i too have gone thru very painful personal loss and this movie portrays the gut wrenching reality of that experience very well life out of balance nothing makes sense well meaning relatives was nice to see ally again she is one of my all time favorite movie laughed and cried as the story unfolded great story and cast well done
my boyfriend and i both enjoyed this film very much the viewer is swept away from modern life into old japan while at the same time exposed to very current themes the characters are realistic and detailed it has an unpredictable ending and story which is very refreshing the story is made up of mini-plots within the life of several geisha living together in a poor city district i highly recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in a realistic romance or life in old
this is a reunion a team and a great episode of justice from hesitation to resolution clark has made a important leap from a troubled teenager who was afraid of a controlled destiny to a superman who like green arrow sets aside his emotions to his few loved ones ready to save the whole planet this is not just a thrilling story about teamwork loyalty and friendship this is also about deciding more important in life a lesson for clark i do not want the series to end but i hope the ensuing episodes will strictly stick to what justice shows without any rewind pushes and put a good end here of a wonderful beginning of this episode however we should have seen more contrast between lex and the team nine stars should give it enough credit
this was a delightful presentation hemo as a greek god was so well played by the animation with vanity arrogance snobbish superiority and innocent wonder the quote scene i recall vividly is when hemo tires of all this plumbing you haven't learned my secrets at all and threatens to storm out the scientist answers him in a single word thalassa salt water which horrifies the fiction writer but mollifies hemo and segues so neatly into the chemical aspects of blood a splendid blend of entertainment and information make this a classic as fresh and engrossing today as the day it was released stimulating the interest and imagination is fundamental to teaching kids to love learning
i'm not a steve carell fan however i like this movie about dan an advice columnist who goes to his parents house for a stay with his kids and ends up falling in love with his girlfriend its a story thats been told before but not like this there are simply too many little bits that make the film better than it should be the cast is wonderful and even if carell is not my cup of tea he is quite good as the widower suppose to know everything but finds that knowing is different than feeling and that sometimes life surprises you at times witty and wise in the way that an annoying hallmark card can be the film still some how manages to grow on you and be something more than a run of the mill film worth a look see
when i first heard about this series on have to say that out of all the shows that i have one tops it all off i had to see this that is what i really did when i got the first volume of this was the best i really liked the all the fight scenes were awesome i have to say that my favorite characters in the show were archer and of course i also like illya and of the episodes on the volumes were very cool another thing i have to say about the series is michael for others playing the voice of berserker he does have a cool character and i even watched the entire series all over again before watching the final volume so if you to see something see this the best
one of the most heart-warming foreign films i've ever young girl is an amazing talent stellar performances by her the old man king of masks and liang living the deplorable treatment of children especially females is the music the original chinese dialog heightens the emotional intensity of the performances and the is a must see enjoyable family film although not for very young children would have rated the dvd release even higher if the soundtrack had been transferred better onto the dvd and the transfer had included the widescreen version
i fell in love with emily watson in breaking the waves then grew even more fascinated by her range and adeptness in hilary and jackie now comes this stunning portrayal of a rich girl who spurns breeding and convention in favor of mothering the tortured soul of the child of a man clearly in need of mothering her eyes are the mirror to his soul what gentle and beautiful eyes they who take things literally will find marleen gorris poetic and allegorical direction quite frustrating romantics who are willing to go with the amazing kinetic energy is this filmed allegorical poem will be well rewarded
i didn't really know what to expect when going out to watch the film apart from the slightly surreal basic plotline that a lonely man orders a russian bride over the internet that and it had nicole kidman in it i absolutely loved the film though and came out thinking down to earth the film moves along nicely with a few suprises at each corner the relationships in the film are believeable with nicole and chaplin working against each other beautifully the humour is subtle with some great office'-like scenes at the bank and the thriller element add tension without being the film is about real people in an unusual situation less about heroics and more about delicate relationships brit-filmmaking at its
excellent endearing film with peter falk and paul reiser joining forces as father and shows up one evening to state that after over years of marriage mom dukakis has left rest of the film depicts the father and son on a day trip to get thoughts off what has occurred with them away the daughters can play story shows the adventures of father and son in their discussion of life what should have been why mom was complaining about dad as they discuss their philosophies of see an unexpected fishing trip and pool playing which leads to a near brawl both men seem to break out of their daily end is a downer as we learn why mom suddenly left it becomes a story of courage and the human spirit in the face of adversity never too late to change
i have screened this movie several times here at college and every time i show it the number of people watching with me grows exponentially in addition to the virgins anyone i've already shown it to needs to see it again it takes a little while to get into it but by the end the whole room is screaming shouting yelling rewinding scenes repeatedly repeating dialogue and just totally and completely engrossed in the moviegoing experience that is pia zadora in the lonely lady scene after scene after scene of the most ineptly filmed poorly written horribly acted trash is thrown at you in an all-out assault that ranks as the campiest thing i own small statement friends for me nothing compares u pia and i don't suppose i'm the only one ever felt this way
every kid has that movie that he pops into vhs when he has nothing to do or when there is a babysitter around this was that movie for i can tell you the whole plot exactly i must have seen it times at least and i can say it is a good still have the tape i haven't watched it in years but maybe i'll get around to it this week and be a kid for the you just have to love the care bears and their
a clever undeniably entertaining romp starring peter ustinov as a career embezzler with his sights set on a us conglomerate in london abetted by foxy deceptively sharp maggie smith and threatened with exposure by jealous company man bob newhart this is a heist film with a lot of brains ustinov is exceptional as is smith and newhart is quite funny the real surprise is karl malden as the pill popping executive vice-president malden has seldom been so loose cesar romero and robert morley pop up in some funny cameos the excellent music score is by laurie johnson eric direction is brisk and the script by ustinov and ira wallach is first-rate very smart a swinging good time

this movie was so good leon phelps is hilarious i went out after and bought a case of cognac i went out after and bought a case of went out after and bought a case of went out after and bought a case of went out after and bought a case of went out after and bought a case of went out after and bought a case of went out after and bought a case of went out after and bought a case of went out after and bought a case of went out after and bought a case of went out after and bought a case of cognac
an excellent film with great performances from zack lochley much to their displeasure mine garibaldi arrived on station due respect to jerry doyle but in seasons i lost sympathy for the character it doesn't take him long to start criticizing zack i love best of all on the taking charge i'm sure zack could have coped the soulhunter plot is fascinating especially if you believe in heaven as zack does the humour supplements it nicely
carlos carmen is one of the finest achievements in world let alone spanish cinema it manages to excite interest in flamenco in its wonderful staged adaptations from bizet with powerful physical force at the same time we see the impact of the creation and rehearsal of a new interpretation of carmen on the and the principle dancers the fine line between life and art is dazzling
when i went to watch this movie my expectations were really low but i was pleasantly surprised thought i was going to watch a boring teen-flick but in fact the plot is interesting and well executed the acting was somewhat convincing especially from melville who really shows his talent in this movie and the fight scenes were for a low budget movie very well done think this movie deserves a broader audience than it has received it is a movie which can be seen by the whole family maybe not the smallest of kids since it contains some rather rough scenes a movie about love and the problems that can occur when you go against your family traditions the movie is very much like bend it like beckham but i actually think this movie pulls it off better
the men in white movie is definitely one of the funniest if not the funniest comedy movies i ever watched i watched quite a lot it is about two garbagemen who become men in white and then stop an invasion from space it is also a parody of lots of classic movies such as men in black star wars or dr strangelove anyone who says that this movie is crappy has something wrong with his head there are tons of funny gags and jokes here and you might actually get injury to your mouth from laughing too hard happened to me if you can watch this movie on tv watch it now you certainly won't regret it
i loved this movie great storyline and actors and good movie sets it told the story in a way i can easily understand and pay attention to without falling asleep i would like to know where i could get the soundtrack i can not find it anywhere please email me if you know where i could get the soundtrack other than not being able to find the soundtrack i thought the movie was fascinating swayze did a great job i think this is some of his best work his past movies were ok but this one really told a story for a change this will go down in history as being one of the best tv films ever aired congrats to the producers and writers of such a great piece of work
shot on an impossible schedule and no budget to speak of the movie turned out a lot better than you would expect certainly much more true to the peter o'donnell books and comic strip than the previous two films you can read the strip currently in the reprints from titan books or in comics revue monthly it is one of the greatest adventure comic strips of all time the movie isn't great but unlike most low budget films it makes the most of what its got and it holds your interest on the dvd extras the interview with quentin tarentino who is obviously stoned is a gas some people have faulted tarentino for associating his name with the film but without him it would never have been made he is a modesty blaise fan and picked a good writer and director all things considered worth stars
i disagree with previous comment about this movie i think it was cute and fun and it carried a good message for young girls like my daughter you don't have to dress like a cheap hooker to be cool you can be smart and pretty and classy all at think the cast was good and the story was fine for the target audience all-in-all my wife daughter and i each thought it was a good movie i certainly recommend it it also has encouraged my daughter to start reading the original nancy drew mysteries which i am sure she will love much as i loved the hardy boys was a struggle to get her to sleep tonight because she wanted to start reading right away i can't think of a better outcome for that movie than rekindling interest in that classic series
anyone who doesn't think bill and bogus journey is one of the greatest movies of all time needs their head checked it somehow manages to be both completely inane and no-brainer but also terrifying knowing and clever at the same time one of those rare films that actually improves upon it predecessor bogus journey can be enjoyed again and again notable highlights include the duel with death and the ending which is highly emotional keanu wants to forget all that matrix rubbish and get down to doing what he does best ted theodore logan in bill and ted the return
harvey best performance so far the new century very nicely photographed a beautiful snap-shot of pre-castro cuba the story revolves around the nephew of a local minor crime boss who develops a friendship with an american with hollywood connections really about the moment when a boy awakens to the fact that the small circle of people he knows actually live in a much larger much more complex world that he doesn't yet script is strong and filled with humor the direction is crisp over all a really professional job that fits in well with the tradition of latin american cinema the one weakness is the decision to shoot in sync-sound english rather than spanish probably to improve sales in the us unfortunately this just makes the film a little less convincing but if you can see beyond this you will find a heartfelt trip to another world recommended
comfortable way of rolling out blunt comments often with expletives to describe things that he is more knowledgeable about than most is quite refreshing there is one other character in the film that constantly tries to verbalize complicated issues using more language than necessary this guy should never have been given a thesaurus cut to noll and you know you're in for a way the pioneers of big wave surfing are portrayed is very evocative of a lost era nevermind the fact that no one knows how these guys made a living much less took care of issues like medical care the use of old film clips throughout was masterfully done
been a while since i've watched this movie and the series but now i'm refreshing my memory this was a very funny movie based on the classic series johnny knoxville and seann william scott were hilarious together bo and luke duke help uncle jesse run moonshine in the general lee when boss hogg forces the dukes off their farm bo and luke sneak around local construction site and find samples of coal they soon realize that boss hogg is gonna strip-mine hazzard county unless the dukes can stop him with the help of their beautiful cousin daisy my only two problems with the movie was that burt reynolds wasn't right for the part of boss hogg and sheriff rosco p coltrane was way too serious other than that i highly recommend the dukes of hazzard
i just saw this at the toronto film festival and i hope it gets wide release because i want to see it again it is a character-driven film and andrew and david are more than up to the task any discussion of the plot might spoilers so i'll just say that the storyline is clever the acting is superb and the effects are amazing well-filmed and well-paced too one of the best films i have seen in ages and very refreshing in this summer of it had the audience laughing the whole time see it if you can particularly liked the candy bar candy bar scene
minutes of pure holiday terror okay so not that scary but it sure is crypt keeper kassir tales a tale of holiday fear giving us all christmas goose gossebumps that is bwahahahahha you should really be careful what you axe santa for have a scary christmas and a happy new fear okay i'll so in the story a greedy wife screamer in the world mary ellen trainor kills her husband bell the coach who gets towel whipped to death in anoes for the money but her plan is ruined when a crazy killer dressed in a santa suit dr giggles drake comes her you look it up on youtube you can watch it for free but most of you have already seen this third viewing but if you haven't seen it i suggest you do
this episode from the first season slightly edges towards controversy with the whole gender bending imagine there would have been a significant amount of editing before this was finished to appease story itself is original and well written and the directing is complemented by the fine lea makes his x-files debut though not as agent krycek but as a victim called michael i especially enjoyed the built up to and the ending different but any bad reviews you may it for yourself and make judgement then
i instantly fell in love with pushing daisies this show manages to put a smile on my face with great storytelling witty dialog and great acting but not all it also manages to keep you until the end the basic idea behind the show bringing people back to life with one touch ending the undead status with a second is interesting and could still be in later seasons but the suspenseful murder cases the unique look of the show and the highly proficient narrator add to the experience but pushing daisies is more than parts it has a certain charm that i really enjoy and i'm looking forward to enter the world of ned and chuck for a second season
it is not the same as the other films about dancing a few normal people found themselves from dancing unlike the dancing films in hollywood the characters in this film are not handsome or hot young people they are someone that you may see everyday in your offices they are some depressed about their lives and finally find themselves and their dreams from dancing this touches me very deeply
so i consider myself pretty big into the anime scene with very few shows i simply will not show however i would recommend to possibly the most original series to date got just about everything i could ask for a side story so to speak about an unconditional love that will not be admitted to a very blatant comedy and a very well put together voice acting cast japanese and american not for the terribly funny aspect to it it would be just another or less as i have noticed a love it or hate it very few people i have seen introduced to this series will end up with a distaste for to the core with everything you could ask for in an afternoon bet the house on this series i'm ready to assure you that you will enjoy it
i didn't know what to expect from ned kelly but absolutely loved it it was dark dramatic and gripping it also felt very authentic i felt that i had been transported back to the i've never been much of a heath ledger fan having only seen him in teen type movies however he is quite compelling in this role ledger plays ned kelly with dignity and intensity showing us how an highly spirited boy became most notorious killer naomi watts is great in a supporting role as society lover highly recommended and from an aussie
tintin and i first of all struck me as a masterpiece documentary the photography and the editing are truly breath-taking follow the life of tintin drawer hergé through an open-hearted interview from the tintin series was drawn on the background of the great ideological fights of the twentieth century in the midst of these hergé has his own demons to fight with and much of his drawing activity seems like an attempt to tame these and to escape into a world of though there are spectacular photographic panoramas of drawings from tintin albums and also some reconstructions and reading of passages from the albums the story of hergé is told entirely through interviews and archive material and never through lived the turbulent life of a true suffering artist but the fantastic world that came of his imagination will continue to amaze readers again and again
i recently discovered that this childhood favorite was available as a dvd although i've seen a great deal of high quality movies since then was in this three-episode low budget thing still stands fun is that i now watched it with my year old daughter and she experiences just the same as i remember from back then the creepy music had to hold my hand even though been raised with watching lotr and resident evil the ever changing theories of who the culprit actually is and also complaining about the theatrical voices from an era before norway discovered the difference between stage acting and movie is the one and only good science fiction movie series ever made in norway and still worth watching
basically this movie is one of those rare movies you either hate and think borders on suicide as the next best thing to do rather than having to sit through it for two hours or as in my case you see it as a kult hit one of those movies wherein the humour the plot the acting is actually very hidden but for those of us willing to go looking for it trusting the director well the reward is u laugh your a of the fact that u have to find the things mentioned above actually makes the movie even more funny because u get the impression the director isn't even aware of how funny his movie is which doesn't seem likely and therein lies the intelligence at the helm of this magnificient project called spaced invaders
if you love kung-fu films and you haven't seen this movie you are cheating yourself this movie is one of the only kung-fu cheapies that could be recommended for fans of all types of film normally it takes a die-hard fan of the genre to see anything in these films but this one has it all the story is well told and complete the fight scenes are great and tend to end before you're completely bored with them crouching tiger throw in a little mystery and torture and you've got yourself one heck of a movie see this one at all costs heck my wife even enjoyed du out of
for a first film in a proposed series it achieves the right balance it is done with style and class showing early days as a refugee and the start of her rise to power in the criminal world i think it is a very portrayal of her character exactly as the writer peter o'donnell intended alexandra staden as modesty is stunningly beautiful and an excellent choice she acts very convincingly as the tough survivor with an exterior of and full marks to tarantino for choosing an unknown actress for the role much more believeable to have a new face creating the part i'm looking forward to the next film
this stirring western spins the tale of the famous rifle of the early west that was coveted by one and all james stewart is the cowboy who wins the prized winchester in a shootout only to lose it in a robbery the story details pursuit of the rifle and a certain man through the film the rifle changes hands time after time as though the owner is fated to lose it through violence the picture has plenty of action and suspense as stewart closes in on his quarry a great cast supports stewart here namely stephen mcnally dan duryea millard mitchell john mcintire and jay c flippen shelley winters seems miscast here and the purpose of her role is rather obscure tony curtis and rock hudson teen heartthrobs in later years have brief but good roles
this has to be one of the best movies to come out of hk in a long time i was eagerly waiting to get my hands on this movie just looking at the title loads of fantastic actors in this show and i was particularly impressed with sam impossibly believable insane behavior and portrayal of a killer machine which totally reversed his normal idol image i would definitely recommend to those looking for a stylish and action packed movie however i must warn you this is also an equally depressing movie as every character in the movie is in some kind of dead end and trouble of their own and struggling to breathe makes you think about what is life about really
i don't know who could find fault with a simply human and funny film like this with lots of delights for your heart i enjoyed each minute of it and guessed the ending half way through the movie but that did not disappoint me at all it will not only touch your heart but such a good family friendly need many more like these
the only part lacking in this movie is part as the daughter wanting to follow in her footsteps as a daytime soap star otherwise it would be a perfect seems that every actor enjoyed their parts and overacting to fulfill their own enjoyment as well as the script i have to wonder if a little ad lib'ing wasn't taking place in parts it was well cast and there are some classic lines that will stick with a fantastic movie everyone should see at least once i'd recommend not drinking anything that would sting coming out your definitely want to watch the last scene closely nurse nan has a little secret she'd rather not have shared with you love daytime soaps or despise them this move pokes fun in all the right places
a super comedy series from the series were made in total that suffered in the uk ratings due to poor scheduling when you are up against established comedies like minder even the best new comedies are going to struggle to get i caught the series from episode one and followed it avidly i mentioned it to friends and family at the time but everyone seemed to have been watching something else very very i loved both series and never forgot i looked it up on the internet and found that an ultra-fan was trying to get both series released on his both series are now available on
i am a very big jim carrey fan i laughed my ass off during liar liar and ace ventura i also like him in his serious movies especially truman show this one is a cross between his very funny side and his serious side he is of course very funny in this movie but there are parts that are very serious and he pulls it off with a lot of ease he is truely a multi-function for the rest of the cast i was happy with jennifer acting i think she is more than just a couple of nice tits and great ass morgan freeman makes a very cool god as for steven carell his limited scenes are very funny especially in the anchor i would have to rate this a good acting funny script and some very serious situations make this a very good film
with the amount of actors they have working on the project they have a wide variety of cast nice starship cgi in places but their green screen needs some work anyone heard of adobe after effects they should buy it get their keying are well thought out plenty of trek elements in this to keep it in the right context but but the idea of two guys kissing makes me wind forward the episode im not homophobic but i cant help that i don't find men kissing entertaining mind women anyway for a fan series this is good stuff with minor improvement in their green screen brush up acting and some guidance ratings this series is stunning anyway i recommend this series to who ever enjoyed tng and
james dickey is a wonderfully descriptive author when one reads deliverance one is instantly transported into the lush backwoods of the deep south when one watches john film version of the book one realizes just how accurately he captures the essence of the book the camera is as descriptive as the narration the characters are fully realized and the portrayals are fantastic i first saw this movie in after my freshman year of college i was in a phase where i was watching movies that were all released within a couple of years of my birth in among them were patton papillon and all the men fine films all of them this one was easily the class of the group that says a lot
as a kid i remember being nine or ten and loving this movie it was the all round bollywood movie it is a imitation of bad boys obviously the whole swapping identities but the arrival of two other twins throws everything out of the window and then the arrival of colourful villains who dance and sing the action scenes in the film aren't revolutionary but still amazing scenes the film is genuinely very funny and was the great comeback amitabh bachan needed govinda is a gem like always and this is probably his best work to date he shines as the side kick nd delivers the best comedy scenes available in indian songs are both funny and laughs when you least expect bachan surprisingly is very funny and will make you laugh as bade language chutki naab re daal is the best
if you love cult sci-fi the way i do or if you like movies such as repo man or buckaroo bonzai than you're going to love this one a stream of consciousness sci-fi spectacular including a century junkyard and the earth a million years from now this movie is pure put on steve fly like an eagle or pink dark side of the moon and you're ready to go
first a quick shut up to those saying this movie stinks you can't go to every movie expecting citizen kane this was actually a fun movie jason lee is good in everything he does the only flaw in this movie is i don't think there was enough chemestry between lee and julia stiles they should have dwelled more on that other than that the movie is good fun selma blair needs to eat something worrying me but she still looks beautiful so yes i recommend this movie for a date or light saturday afternoon fun go out of
i absolutely love this game to death ever since i was years old am now it has great graphics characters magic weapons additions and don't forget the ultimately awesome dragoon forms i am still waiting for a remake prequel or a sequel to this spectacular video game play as dart a young swordsman who has the potential to be quite the hero on this adventure you encounter wondrous creatures and boss fights you also encounter some friends on the way who have their own special element such as fire darkness earth light and wind there are also items known as dragoon spirits which allow you to transform into magical creatures of legend dragons wizards creatures called winglies and evil creatures you'll have to face on this adventure of action-packed thrills and excitement one of my all time favorite games the legend of dragoon
great movie when i saw it have to say one of my favorite movies of all time i saw it like times in the theater and got the dvd as i got older and saw it again i realized that the movie is average compared to movies that are known ad good comedys this is nothing i mean rock was hilarious in the movie and the whole switching with the racial stuff breaks a little barriers which is great also the thought of how the movie goes is a nice way of thinking like most thought of a movie but also a little twist which is a very nice touch i like the movie overall so i give it a good for me
george and kim are traveling with their young son miles to a remote cabin in upstate new york when their car hits a deer and swerves into a what seems to be a mere occurrence of misfortune marks the beginning of a terrifying myth becomes reality and a flesh-eating animal and half man a small by larry fessenden is a thought-provoking horror film that often into a somber family acting is characters are well-developed and there are some bone-chilling subtle glimpses of wendigo are handled effectively and never clear what is real and what is even if the story is taking place entirely in miles is my first contact with larry work and surely won't be the this film a you don't mind watching something out of
the true measure of any fictional piece of work is whether or not the characters grow from their experiences and emerge from the experience altered in some significant way that this change need not be positive or beneficial at the that measure enchanted april is a resounding success as a film in general it succeeds quite well-excellent ensemble cast well-developed characters you come to care about wonderful script and beautiful sets and locations in short the film is well enchanting although all the performances are first-rate three must be mentioned-josie lawrence jim broadbent and joan plowright it says something when miranda richardson does her usual fine work and yet is overshadowed by so many others in the cast most highly recommended particularly if you are a romantic at heart further deponent saith not

i would have rated the series a perfect for outstanding and consistently high quality story and character development had it not been for the last episode of season final episode of the season unending where would certainly appear that the asgard have been killed-off in a very rushed unconvincing and very unceremonious fashion left me in disbelief the extremely rushed end of the series obvious that many of the story arcs were originally scheduled to occur over at least one more season my guess would be that they rapidly accelerated these stories to position the stargate franchise for the two upcoming direct-to-dvd the asgard return in a future movie a very good explanation of the apparent extinction i think that the fans have been cheated with a poor clean-up of end to an otherwise brilliant sci-fi series
hey guys have been looking every where to find these two movies and i can't find them anywhere in my local area am australian could you please help me and tell me where i can buy it from in general home ward bound and are the best movies i have ever seen and are good for people of all ages it was my favourite movie wen i was and it still is even now when i am a teenager it is a great movie for the whole family my entire family loves this movie except for my younger sister because i have watched it that many times that she is sick of it i love this movie and i cant wait till i can buy it again on
the movie is okay it has moments the music scenes are the best of all the soundtrack is a true classic a perfect album it starts out with go for the beginning as a great party song and very up-tempo take me with fun pop song the beautiful cheerful ballad probably the closest thing to on this whole album computer somewhat angry anthem towards appolonia darling of the funniest songs ever it very vaguely makes fun of appolonia when doves climax to this masterpiece i would die u baby i'm a star and of course purple true classic a very appropriate ending for this classic album the movie and the album are both very good i highly recommend them
this series was a cut above the rest of the tv detective series of the day but somehow didn't find an idea of a blind detective may not be totally new but added so much to the story and who could forget pax the beautiful guide dog in the the stories themselves may have been no better than the average series the settings in new orleans the acting and the music note the comment about the music score in other comments i remember that clearly all work to make a good television series even you never know one day paramount might just dig into its archives and release it on dvd
i thought it was a very funny movie i love dog movies and comedy movies so combined they were twice as good and pi are my favorite movies jim belushi is hysterical and jerry lee is hilarious and adorable they make a great team the only downside is that i really didn't understand how wife died she died before this movie but how if they said it i must have missed it other than that i give it two up those dogs lee and zeus must have had a lot of training they were so funny and all the noises jerry lee would make when dooley was talking to him was so funny my favorite was when jerry lee sang and when he would bite peoples privates to get information very very funny lol
first off i didn't know what to expect when i started the someone brings back a cult type movie genre and adapts it into the present something gets inexplicably lost in the not the case here this movie just starts off on the right track part familiar territory but manages to take it over the top as well crockzilla scene anyone that has to be seen and just try and keep a straight face this movie takes some of the old fun cult movie classics and manages to blend it seamlessly into a modern production good to see someone is filling the need in this market very well
i'd never seen an independent movie and i was really impressed by the writing acting and cinematography of closet emotions were very real and intense showing through a eyes the harsh impact of definite never seen an independent movie and i was really impressed by the writing acting and cinematography of closet emotions were very real and intense showing through a eyes the harsh impact of definite see
back to the roots with like it is in heaven what are the real values of life these swedes carve out a message that appeals to every heart we've seen it twice now in a cinema packed to the last seat love pure and joy within the music of a choir simple yet full of power once everyone finds his or her inner tone the glitter of fame to the school of of his youth now empty and ready to be adapted as his new home after collapsing on stage daniel wants to start listening and is drawn into the lives of the simple warm and rough people of the wins the hearts with music and gains the capacity to love and be loved go see it if you've been normed to hollywood this stuff contains no extras just your laughter your compassion your tears
a wonderful and gritty war film that focuses on the inner torment of blinded marine al schmid although it is tough and unpleasant it is in the end heroic triumph over disability and depression the battle scene was superb but one bone to pick no matter how many bullets they fired i never saw any water or dirt being kicked up by the impacts it hurt the realism but i can live with it fine performance by eleanor parker again as his girl friend
the cast was good and i thought it was a good performance from christopher lloyd whom i like from previous movies the movie was a great family movie nothing that would make you worry to show it to younger kids a good story line lots of laughs lighthearted and enjoyable if you want to entertain children without being bored to tears this fits the bill kid pleasing and not difficult for a parent to watch either
first of all when people hear guy ritchie they immediately think of snatch yes snatch was a good movie but the problem is that everyone associates guy ritchie to snatch they don't expect him to explore new frontiers this movie revolver is different than snatch much darker and is very complex the reason i gave a rating of is because i've had to watch revolver times to understand everything so this movie toys with your head very cleverly movie is different than snatch it was done wonderfully the cinematography is beautiful and you can recognize guy personal touch of directing in won me over was the complexity of the protagonist and how we are left with more questions than answers
robert duvall is a direct descendent of confederate general robert e lee according the movie database after seeing this film you may think appearance is reincarnation at best one of my most favorite films i wish the composer peter rodgers melnick had a cd or there was a soundtrack available wonderful scenery and music and all too-true-to-life especially for those of us that live in or have moved to the south this is a real moment in time life moves on slowly but strangers we do not remain
i think the team behind this film did a very good job with the limitations they had only and weeks to write film and edit the whole thing which i think is an achievement in itself although this film is not for the masses a young innocent teenage girl is killed and there is homo-eroticism involved in the story i think that this film is a heart wrenching tragedy and the more deeply involved you get in the story the more sadness you feel more so towards heaton because of the love he feels but is not is one of my favourite british films that i enjoyed very much and would watch again i think that a shame that is film is not very well heard of at all
i loved dedee pfeiffer that spelled right in cybil haven't seen her for awhile and forgot how much i missed her i thought she did a great job in this the supporting cast was pretty good too in some angles the daughter even looked like a young nicole kidman the abductor was pretty creepy and the story generally had some good twists the young boyfriend was a hottie i thought the husband definitely had something to do with it for got the lifetime movie network for christmas and am loving these movies kept my interest and i'll watch it again when they rerun it can anyone else recommend any similar movies to this you can post on the board or send me a private email if you want thanks in advance aboutagirly
a movie you start watching as a late night cable porn it is hot in that department but it has even a lot more it has a sense of humor some action in and out of the bed and it has reasonable acting as well as a story worth definite adult only movie but well worth watching
this movie is to halloween what the hilarious christmas story is to christmas both are relatively low-budget no-big-name-stars type both are two of the absolute greatest and funniest movies available both seasonal classics spaced invaders comes galloping out right from the start with warmth and humor and a superb cast of five goofy martians klembecker the realtor russell the deputy vern at the fuel dispensing depot and so many more you just have to see this movie to believe it and like christmas story it just keeps getting better and better with each viewing and you pick up on fun little things each time most definitely a ten
now many would think to stay away from this movie just because of the title if you do not have the stomach for gory movies then what are you doing reading this review anyhow i borrowed the video from a friend of mine and fell in love with this movie immediately this movie is chock full of wonderful gore plus the usual other ingredients that make up a b-movie add up to one hell of a viewing experience if you're a lover of good quality experiences then by all means watch this great flick
lovely piece of good cinema this is one of those films that you see smiling and you do not know why well one of the reasons could be that we are before one of the most surprising directors today and he is able to film you are watching the film you can feel what mr straight was feeling when he took the decision to go to visit his brother with his marvellous john deere what changed in his mind what changed in your mind when you watched this beautiful fraternal love story
i really enjoyed this movie the acting by the adult actors was great although i did find the main kid a little stiff but he carried himself very well for being a new talent the humor is very sublime and not in your face like most hollywood comedy junk the nutty professor if you have a short attention span and are used to the typical hollywood stuff you probably wouldn't like this as it is a bit slower paced i picked it up on blu-ray and i have to say the image quality is top notch probably one of the better looking blu-rays i've seen so far the extras were cool too they deleted quite a bit but probably a good thing as most of the deleted scenes didn't really add anything
this video rocked eddie is one of the funniest comics i have ever seen not only does he have class he makes some of the funniest observations on history and culture that i have ever seen eddie is the most original and most intelligent comic i've seen in a very long time tell all those other stand-ups to get off the stage and let this executive reign
simple rules for dating my teenage daughter is my opinion is an absolute abc classic i'm not sure i haven't seen every episode but i still enjoyed it hard to say which episode was my favorite however i think it was always funny when a mishap occurred i always laughed at that despite the fact that james garner and david spade were good i liked the show more when john ritter was the leading man if you ask me his sudden passing was very tragic everyone always gave a good performance the production design was spectacular the costumes were well-designed and the writing was always very strong in conclusion i hope some network brings it back on the air for fans of the show to see
ok basically this is a popcorn sci-fi movie but from the outset its obvious that it has been directed with a great deal of intelligence you can count about clichés that the film is building up to but it only delivers on about three of them and a couple of them have a twist to them that lets you know once again that the director hasn't assumed that you are an idiot kurt acting is truely superb and brings a depth from the character that is suprising and rewarding recommended if you've just seen something really stupid and want to rebuild your faith
i sure would like to see a resurrection of a up dated seahunt series with the tech they have today it would bring back the kid excitement in grew up on black and white tv and seahunt with gunsmoke were my every have my vote for a comeback of a new sea need a change of pace in tv and this would work for a world of under water by the way thank you for an outlet like this to view many viewpoints about tv and the many any ole way i believe i've got what i wanna be nice to read some more plus points about sea my rhymes would be lines would you let me leave me out to be in doubt and have me to this is so then i must go so lets do it
early hollywood at best a classic kipling poem is transformed into an epic adventure featuring memorable performances by a stellar cast i think the measure of a good film is how many times you can watch it and still genuinely enjoy it i've seen it a dozen times and still cry at the end and admit it you do too
i was watching this movie at one of my usual time which is real real late at night usually if a movie doesn't interest me i start falling asleep and have to raid the fridge to stay first i thought what i had to do since this pacing started off slow along with the fact that its shots tended to linger with the character for a long time but after a bit i start getting more into the movie as more is revealed about the main character through his story telling by the end you feel like you've known him your whole life the movie kept my interest so much that i didn't even know the sun was about to much of bizzare style but there is enough of quirky characters to make the film amusing
this movie kept me constantly entertained in comparing this to serial mom mr waters has gone back to his grittier side this is not nearly as is a dark side here a message about how success and fame changes a person but more importantly how it changes the people around is not a false moment in this characters are somewhat cartoonish but i want to believe that is what mr waters is trying to is fascinating to watch how mr waters has evolved this is truly his finest work
contrary to some summaries the women depicted in the film are not geisha they are oiran living outside the most famous pleasure districts and their lives and experiences represent the lives of a great number of tokugawa era women i can't say the stories were particularly enlightening but their charm lies in just how typical they are the themes are universal and everyday love friendship and did greatly enjoy the art direction and the acting i felt like i was getting a glimpse of a time and place i can never otherwise glimpse the actors especially the women who played the main oiran were a thrill to watch i'd only recommend this movie to people who want a taste of japanese culture or to those who enjoy quiet and emotional stories a great example of both
it appears that no middle ground on this movie most of it takes place in a dream and like most dreams often foolish and illogical also a gorgeous production with some great songs and fine performances especially by our deadpan unknowing insults and various other faux pas at the dream reception are hilarious and her jitterbug with binnie barnes is a surprise and a delight at one point she gets to sing a snippet from carmen followed by the final trio of faust a lapdog for some strange reason then aloha oe on the beach a surreal entertaining if you can get into the groove
this has to be one of the most beautiful moving thought provoking films around good family entertainment and at the same time makes you think very hard about the issues involved every time i see the ghost of zac riding the bike through the puddle at the end i can't help but cry my eyes out john performance is so touching and it is a shame he is no longer with us gone but not forgotten a outstanding film full marks
what can i say oh yeah those freaking fingers are so weird they scare the heck out of me but it is such a funny film jim carrey works the grinch if you havent already seen it then what you waiting for an invitation go go and get watch it you dont know what your missing
another example of the unique talents of cary grant a performance worthy of oscar consideration yet once again shunned by the academy mr grant runs the gamut from silly to tender in this marvelous comedy about a man who decides to move out of the big city the pitfalls of building a home are well chronicled and became the basis for the more modern tom hanks vehicle the money you like good old fashioned comedy without the cursing and the gratuitous sex this movie is a must see
this is the story of australian commandos who are captured out of uniform after a raid since they are out of uniform they are justly treated as spies as such they are tried convicted and sentenced to death the japanese court-martial out of admiration for their heroism authorizes that they be given a death of course under the code of bushido this means that they are to be beheaded a fate for which as westerners they are unprepared
this is a great movie for all ages its the story about three animals how have to find their way home there is a bit of a twist at the end and mainly throughout the whole movie you never know what is going to happen next this movie makes you cry and makes you laugh you just don't know what going to happen next the trek home is all beautiful with all the wonderful wildlife scenes they producers also spent a lot of money for this movie and it shows too the animals in this movie were well trained and are great themselves everything about this movie is great out of the whole way rent or buy it today i can guarantee you will love it the whole family will
i grew up watching this movie and i still love it just as much today as when i was a kid don't listen to the critic reviews they are not accurate on this murphy really shines in his can sit down with your whole family and everybody will enjoy recommend this movie to everybody to see it is a comedy with a touch of demons a little bald kid with god like movie takes you from to tibet of into the amazing view of the wondrous temples of the mountains in a beautiful view so go do your self a favor and snatch this one up you wont regret it
tripping over i must say at first i was a little disappointed in the first few episodes but having faith in the show and abe unquestionable talent i continued to watch i can safely say i'm now glad that i did the story did develop quite well and all the characters have a strong base and most don't have any information only thing i can fault in this production is the somewhat annoying voice and pronunciation possessed by the character good acting coupled with a stellar plot really gets this show over the line to hoping for another season
i love this movie because i grew up around harness racing pat boone behind the sulky reminds me of my father who was drawn to the trotters because unlike thoroughbred jockeys men of normal height and weight can be drivers the home in indiana is a better movie but also a very different movie april love is light and easy to watch a feel good movie though that pat views prohibited him from ever kissing the girl quite a change from standard fare home in indiana with walter brennan in black and white with no hint that anyone will ever burst into song captures the stress and struggle better thereby making the ultimate accomplishment more satisfying but it requires a bigger emotional investment
being that this movie has a lot of fine entertainment qualities i think it should some more credit than it has been given on your basic who done it thriller with sex and murder but it keeps you guessing right to the end i like these kinds of movies and i certainly think this one meets the me it was worth watching more than once so i'll give it an on imdb
the great and underrated marion davies shows her stuff in this late silent comedy that also showcases the wonderful william haines davies plays a hick from georgia who crashes hollywood with help from haines they appear in cheap comedies until marion is discovered and becomes a big dramatic star a great lampoon on hollywood and its pretentions davies haines are a wonderful team bad they never made a talkie together and the guest shots from the likes of charlie chaplin douglas fairbanks william s hart john gilbert elinor glynn and marion davies have to see it are a hoot a must for any serious film buff or for anyone interested in the still-maligned marion davies
the italian is an astonishingly accomplished film for its time stunningly shot with lighting effects that are truly sublime this is an early gem that clearly reveals reginald barker to be a pioneer director of equal standing to griffith and maurice tourneur how much control thomas ince exerted over the production is hard to know but this film still has extraordinary power the simple story of an italian immigrant struggling to keep his family alive in new york is very moving the themes of social injustice revenge and forgiveness are completely relevant today the use of close-ups is outstanding and the powerhouse performance of george beban is electrifying what we need now is a really good print transferred to dvd so we can truly appreciate this early masterpiece of cinema
beautifully done a lot of angst friendship may not endure all but in the end all that matters or so a group of friends learn i have watched it over and over again the music is also amazing when kei loses the one friend he has he gives up until he meets sho an orphan boy who is not repelled by his true nature in the lawless streets of mallepa they struggle for their own place among a melting pot of asian races and learn that sometimes being on top can cost you more than you are ever ready to pay a surprise ending that grips as much as the whole movie does i couldn't get enough of it gackt and hyde do a wonderful job of acting proving they are more than pretty boys who sing
to the wrestler a degree of verite and cinematic skill that disarms the viewer and then hypnotizes as dialogue is minimal but the pauses and silence conflict in a balkanized denmark is volatile as we saw recently jihad murders in the netherlands and riots in france while i harbor no love for islam the departure from the west from christian values holds no cause for director of this film managed to mirror the two societies in a way that belabored neither emphasizing the development of aicha as an individual who became a champion not so much in the ring but to all those around her even her worst i will stop here to avoid the spoiler
this is probably my favorite movie of all time it is perfection in its storytelling it will break your heart not because over sentimental but because you will truly feel every emotion these characters go through you feel for doggie because of the hopeless situation that existed for young girls in china at that time
tears of kali is an original yet flawed horror film that delves into the doings of a cult group in india comprised of german psychologists who have learned how to control their wills and their bodies to the point that they can cause others to be healed through radical techniques can trigger nightmarish hallucinations and physical pain and torture to release the pent-up demons inside film is shown as a series of vignettes about the taylor-eriksson above-mentioned cult group the first segment is somewhat slower than the rest but serves fine to set up the premise for the rest of the film the rest of it plays out like a film with some of the key staples thrown in the mix nudity some gore to keep you say check this out may not be spectacular but concept is pretty neato and it delivers in the right spots
a woman left alone after the death of her husband finds herself attracted to her friend and handy man in a slightly twisted story the woman begins sleeping with the handy man in an effort to revive herself the twisted part the handy man is also her on and off love if this wasn't strange enough the mother manages to fall for this man and when her daughter finds out she blames not only her dysfunctional relationship but also her messed up life on her poor you may think badly of this woman the truth is movie manages to portray her in a positive light beautifully played by anne reid this character has dimension and portrays great truly brilliant performance and an enjoyable
they all laughed is a superb peter bogdanovich that is finally getting the recognition it deserves and why their are many reasons the fact that set in new york which truly sets the tone the fantastic soundtrack the appealing star turns from ben gazzara and the late john ritter who is superb and of course no classic is complete without audrey hepburn the film is a light and breezy romantic comedy that is very much in the vein of screwball comedy from the thirties film is essentially about the odyssey detective agency which is run by gazzara who with his fellow detectives pot smoking and roller skating eccentric blaine films co-producer and john ritter basically the gazzara falls for a rich tycoon and ritter falls for beautiful dorothy stratten who sadly murdered infamously after production they all laughed is essential viewing for bogdanovich fans
i'm biased towards any movie that paints a luxuriant picture of italy in my opinion the most romantic country in the world unfortunately the movie was rather short unusually so for a period piece and a little sparse on the cinematography aspect however the excellent story makes up for it the four ladies embark on a much-needed relaxing vacation with problems on their minds over the course of the movie they realize their problems and begin fixing them they believe san salvatore the castle they stay in has an enchanting effect on people a tub of love says lottie wilkins you can watch their gradual change from dissatisfied to exuberant as the italian seaside works its magic on their problems and their solutions are plausible the actresses were great the background music seemed very appropriate for an romantic italian locale all in all a movie for me
this movie is one i strongly recommend about a boy stanley yelnats lebeouf who is wrongly convicted of a crime and sent to camp green lake a boys detention center there he is forced to dig holes feet deep and feet in diamiter while there he meets the other boys of the camp magnet armpit squid x-ray and zigzag all of them are digging not to build charactor but to find outlaw kate treasure throughout the movie book stanley learns more about the past more about himself and more about digging holes i give this movie a because i am very picky when it comes to books to movies want the movie to follow the book exactly but still it did real well
i enjoyed this film very much many korean people will feel familiar with this film because many of them have tutors when they go to school cinematography was average the movie would have been better if the angel or the movement of the camera was more irregular editing however was very neat and acting was also very good kim ha neul usually played an innocent weak girl in the korean soap-opaeras but this time she plays a cute tomboy very well kwon sang woo also plays his role very i like the most about this film is the emotion of the characters are not too exaggerated there are many korean romance films that the characters cry river before the audience and i always thought it was very stale there was no such crap in this funny and well-done
this movie is one of my all time favorites cary grant victor mclaglen and douglas fairbanks a cast not to mention sam jaffe as gunga din drama action adventure and comedy all rolled up into one the final battle scene still to this day gives me chills and the ending always leaves me in tears if you haven't seen it i'd strongly recommend it
gandhi as a husband and father has always been discussed by people in india father is a story that only a few would have known to such details surely an insight into personal i liked the movie for story and cinematography jariwala akshay khanna and shefali shah have all done a good job most scenes of the movie would be nice desktop job traditional indian folk music as background score during certain parts of the movie gives a good feel of the what i didn't quite like was the narration style at several points i found the tone good work by anil kapoor productions i would recommend it as must-watch-once
i remember seeing this years ago when it first came out and i was floored by parker performance and the movie was pretty good also for anyone spent a little too much time in the scene this movie will have a special charm for you not too serious mostly funny and parker posey definitely blazes her talented way through this indie especially liked the diaz character me of every single struggling dj i've ever known and many other movies could take a cue from this movie on how to preach the virtue of responsibility without being boring and bland about
i have no idea what the other reviewer is talking this was a wonderful movie and created a sense of the era that feels like time travel the characters are truly young mary is a strong match for byron claire is juvenile and a tad annoying polidori is a convincing beaten-down sycophant all are beautiful curious and decadent not the frightening wrecks they are in works as an independent piece of shock film and i loved it for different reasons but this works like a merchant and ivory film and was from my readings the best capture of what the summer must have felt like romantic yes but completely rekindles my interest in the lives of shelley and byron every time i think about the film one of my all-time favorites
secret of the lens is perhaps a pretty campy all-time favorite of mine the best and funniest from kajawari yoshiaki who is known for splatter anime and sleazy hentai-ecchi anime i wish he did more campiness like favorite scenes are the psychedelic cg sequence the parts where lord helumis blows up his failing henchmen the party riots that bill causes of the funniest scenes and whenever my favorite character worsle this is not for serious sophisticated anime fans
a quiet sweet and beutifully nostalgic movie on how it is to be confronted with old friends and surroundings from your youth with all that memories and the problems and sorrows of the present with you a movie that makes you feel good all the ingredients are here old jelousy rivalry friendship and loyalty mischief nightly fridge-raids and all the other fun stuff that we all remember from our summer camps all the characters get the opportunity for a week to experience this again as the old camp-leader now is retiring and want to meet the children from the golden years of the camp all of them are now in their thirties and in the middle of their careers
i also just got back from an advanced screening of redeye and i must say i haven't had so much fun at a movie in a long time wes craven is at his best ever he brings us an amazing end of summer thriller i was so desperately craving this is the thriller of the doubt the actors are amazing and the action is realistic and fun the were great it steadily built suspense i was on the edge of my seat most of the movie been a while since i heard an audience cheer and clap and get excited in a theater your looking for and a good plot this summer redeye delivers go see it
the devil dog hound of hell is really good film it has good acting by the cast including richard crenna and music is spooky and gives that devilish liked the effects on the dog and i think the creature itself looked really cool with its like part on his neck and acted really you like horror films and haven't seen the devil dog hound of hell before and are able to find and buy this rare film then do so because its a good movie and i don't think you'll be disappointed
carter wong plays a noble hero on a quest for a book of healing which leads him seeking ultimate vengeance the pacing is good in this film and there are a lot of fight scenes to keep the movie going the flying guillotines look wicked and the main villain has no problems using them although the story isn't strong the action is fun and draws you to the very end i felt could've had a and dark this is great ol skool kung fu
the horse is indeed a fine animal picturesque depictions of wild horses and their grace could never have been more majestic in an animation animation is simply stupendous the fine animation forms the backbone of the beauty that the horses embolden across the flick more so when the stallion traverses diverse terrain jumps across cliffs and braves waters too is very impressive the wonderful instrumental music lures you to appreciate the movie say the story of the west was written from the saddle of a horse huh well the story of a fine horse sure was written from the saddle of the west in all this movie is clearly up there with the best it is one of the best animation flicks i have watched would be a very fine choice on a lonely night an easy
with all thats going on in the world sometimes we need an escape curly sue is just that not a complicated plot or deep meaning however it is not devoid of substance there is more than furious action or heart pounding dramas there are the charming little shows you can watch with your kids and have enough substance to enjoy with your date try it you may like it more than you think the little girl is really smart and cute the dad and the girl go thru some slapstick routines when a jealous boyfriend steps in trouble brews for curly and the life shes known may be torn asunder fred thompson and kelly lynch play good roles as the upper crust and alison porter and james belushi are a interesting fable like duo portraying street wise homeless drifters their worlds collide and comedy ensues
what can i add that the previous comments haven't already said this is a great film and the light sabre duel star wars tribute has to be seen to be believed there are moments of genius throughout this movie if you can see it now thanks again to rick baker who gave me this movie many years ago
what a good movie at last a picture revealing a unknown side of rock illusions of fame well-known rockers are getting old and forgotten not the music and with a good sense of humour have you ever danced on bill rock around the still crazy is probably the best movie about rock n'roll i have ever seen far much better than spinal tap for instance why because in still crazy people are mature they have a different point of view about rock about love and about life they want to catch up with their crazy youth they miss so much beyond the story itself we see characters with their own personality weaknesses and dreams like anyone of a good time watching this to the awesome soundtrack and finally thinking of your own
as i saw the movie i was really shocked to see what the was about i know i may be wrong about some things but it seemed like the really had an effect on people of the time some people said they would want to go back to the from what i saw i would say yes for the excitement and no for the outcome but my opinion
one of the most interesting movies to be classified as blaxploitation coonskin is a rich text full of wonderful insight he wrote it in collaboration with scat man crothers and barry white who appear in the film as well the racist imagery can often be disturbing but the message of the movie was so powerful that the naacp gave it an endorsement only highly recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in an examination of the pervading atmosphere of racism that bakshi attempts to deconstruct wonderful stuff
the journey of hope is about a trek that many nomadic and poor turks make so they could live the good life in switzerland these people are so desperate to live like westerners that they'll give up their life and lives in an attempt to reach the promised land so many of them are swindled by greedy crooks who make their living off of charging huge fees for desperate people who are in a no win situation one family braves the cold the treacherous mountain range and predatory criminals only to discover that not always a shining white light at the end of the tunnel this problem exists world wide not just in america some people tend to forget that a heart breaker of a film that'll leave you wondering why at the recommended
i am a huge john denver fan i have a large collection of his music on vinyl i saw this christmas special when it was originally on tv and loved it i have the original vinyl album and cd i have the original cd and later release the later release is missing several songs though i see that it has been released this year with all original songs to my surprise i found the original cd for sale at wow to think that a christmas cd would be worth that much to me no amount is worth selling this treasure it is my favorite christmas cd i have never been able to find it on vhs or dvd i would love to have either version if anyone has one available please let me know thanks
well i thoroughly enjoyed this movie it was funny and sad and yes the guy andie macdowell shagged was hot interesting realistic characters and plots as well as beautiful scenery i think my mum would like it i still think they should have been allowed to call it the sad club though
domestic import was a great movie i laughed the whole time it was funny on so many levels from the crazy outfits to the hilarious situations the acting was great alla korot larry dorf howard hesseman and all the others did an awesome job because it is an independent film written by a first-time writer it doesn't have the clichés that are expected of other comedies which was such a relief it was a unique and interesting and you fall in love with the characters and the heart-warming story i heard it was based on a true story if so then that is hilarious amazing i highly recommend this movie
it breaks my heart that this movie is not appreciated as it should be its very underrated people forgot what movies are really about nowadays they only think about bum bum movies which can be quite fun watching with popcorn and friends like transformers movies which are oriented with hyper mega high budget like or even higher on special effects only and which are dumb movies without storyline its the kind of a movie what i despite most of course it is fun watching greatly made cgis but we do not gain anything essential from that kind of honestly think that performance was excellent especially busy philipps alongside with erika christensen and victor i respect made this movie an oscar worth emotional performance by busy philipps was astonishing its such a shame we wont see oscar in her hands which she deserves
i found this movie thought-provoking and its ambiguity refreshing in a world of quick-fix films where we are manipulated into loving the good guy and hating the bad guy scott cohen a very handsome television actor does a great job of portraying the family black child who aspires to gain his love and respect as well as that of his widowed sister-in-law with whom he apparently has a history judd hirsch plays against his usual good guy image as a father who triangulated his sons and now is left with the one he always i saw this at the tribeca film festival i was enchanted by the lovely way the sawdust was used to portray a family tradition as explained by the is a fitting successor to the classic ordinary people i just realized judd hirsch was in that too
i know that you've already entered this in film festivals at least i think you have i may just be making that up but i think this should get best animated short film in every one bravo i can't wait for the full film i realize that you may not hear this often enough because of the bizarre nature of your animations but hear it now and accept it as the truth kudos my friend okay now i'm just trying to get ten lines of text though i still mean it and here comes yet another and i cannot stop here yet this is extremely annoying and yet at the same time i have nothing better to do in fact i'll probably watch all of your movies in yet another spasmodic jason steele marathon i do have a lot of
lots of reviews on this page mention that this movie is a little dark for kids that depends on the kid this isn't a movie for a year old more geared toward the years and older crowd i saw this movie when i was i absolutely loved it at the time most animated movies were a little too childish for my tastes this movie deals with more serious issues and therefore has a little more emotional impact in this movie characters can die and be sent to hell this gives a little more emotional weight to the scenes where characters are risking their lives the good guys aren't always perfectly sweet and nice other cartoons they have real motivations like revenge and greed but also compassion and friendship shows that things aren't always black and movie
this is one of those rare movies lovely and compelling dignified and quirky a true gift i consider it a prerequisite for any trip to italy or any vacation at all because it reminds you to open yourself up to a broader experience find the magic i especially loved josie lawrence as lottie wilkins but every lead and supporting actor is flawless in this film further the costumes if you're drawn to fashion and costumes are extraordinarily well done i just wish they'd release it on dvd because i'm wearing my tape version out well worth your time just make sure to settle in to watch it without any interruptions
a lovely little b picture with all the usual joe lewis touches people ripping up pillows and auras of lurking fear also alas an ending that comes out of nowhere because apparently the auteur has lost interest in the movie or perhaps because as a b picture it has to fit into a slot
when the grinch came out i was excited though i thought it was going to be a happy go lucky film and it was though it did have a little nightmare before christmas touch to it you know kind of dark and spooky i loved this film because it helped fill people with the christmas spirit so mostly the grinch saved christmas and what happened then well in whoville they say that the small heart grew three sizes that day merry grinchmas

now i've always been a fan of full puppet work but i have to say that robot jox is one of there better projects yes you heard me the story works wonderful the atmosphere really works and the actors do a first rate job gary graham who really makes his mark on tv in shows like alien nation the series and star trek enterprise shows that he can be an action star who kicks ass and takes name the stop motion effects could have been a tiny bit better the color was wrong they look plastic to me instead of the metal they were suppose to be but that is a minor complaint compared to the whole that is the robot jox if you like gary graham or other full moon movies then you will like this movie stars out of
the last wave is one of those movies that relies heavily on the mind the title refers to the aboriginal doomsday theory there will be one last wave that wipes out burton chamberlain is a sydney lawyer hired to defend some aborigines accused of murder around this time there has been unusually heavy rainfall in australia while defending the aborigines david learns the last wave theory and begins to wonder whether just last sequence is a metaphor for descending into the depths of mind peter weir created a perplexing but thought-provoking movie aboriginal actor david gulpilil you may have seen in walkabout crocodile dundee and rabbit-proof fence provides an interesting supporting role as one of the you get a chance watch the making of feature on the dvd peter weir explains some of the undertones some of which relate to richard background
whilst it is universally acknowledged that fearful symmetry was heavily influenced by the kolchak episode they have been they are they will be whether this makes it a rip-off or a homage is an altogether more controversial point as a huge fan of both series i subscribe to the latter belief although the less charitable may not do james whitmore was brave to take on the task of directing such a difficult episode invisible elephants and gorilla suits sounds like a recipe for disaster but he pulls it off with style the teaser being an absolute gem lance guest does a great job of making a credible character out of kyle lang and jack rader seethes with menace as ed meecham forget fearful dubious originality and just enjoy it as a deeply satisfying x file
honestly this is the best reality show anyone has ever come up with in order to win the money you have to actually be intelligent not only that you've got to be brave athletic cunning etc it actually requires skill not like some lame-ass shows that are on these days and yet they only have two seasons of it need to bring this show back they'll have a hard time pulling anderson cooper away from cnn he was seriously it was an amazing show you never knew who would be going when and it was so much fun trying to figure out the mole yourself it was a show you could actually play yourself if you wanted back the mole bring back the mole
the only complaint i have about this adaptation is that it is sexed-up things that were only hinted at in the novel are shown on-screen for some weird reason did they think the audience would be too stupid to understand if they were not shown everything out-right other than that this is very good-quality all the actors do marvelous jobs bringing their characters to life for the shallow women out there worth watching at least because toby stephens as gilbert is the sexiest thing ever if i were helen i would have conveniently forgotten i was still married the minute i laid eyes on of a the ending scene is a funny reversal of what happened in the book
there are few movies that appear to provide enterntainment as well as realism if you've ever wondered about the role of snipers in modern war take a look at this one just loved the scene where hundred soldiers get shooting at the jungle no-one quite sure where that shot they nicked one scene to saving private ryan so it has to have some merit in the
first i was caught totally off guard by the initial lyricism and then i became totally enchanted with the unfolding story and engrossed with the brilliant directing the characters were all fully developed not bigger-than-life but just like the people we live among anywhere we are in the world in sweden in turkey or in america all completely believable human beings with foibles and nobility hollywood could learn so much from this beautiful film it shows that there is no need to go into every little detail behind every action to bring out the whole theme clear and bright and that shows the brilliance of the director hearfelt thanks to kay pollak and the wonderful cast for this superb treat
is just as good as the original very nearly achieves greatness because of remarkable ear for music and dialogue skewers the self-important swagger of the hip-hop poseurs the group niggaz with hats are every rap group you ever heard and utterly self-parodic wardrobe is unbelievable buy the oop soundtrack if you can
a sweet-natured young mountain man with a sad past thomas comes upon an abandoned baby girl in the woods and instantly falls in love with her the town elders generally support him in keeping the child though a local temptress seymour thinks little of the new family a determined little girl on a long walk and a sinister travelling salesman strathairn at his creepiest have parallel stories which converge in a fateful way this is a charming slice-of-life in the ozarks in the same vein as where the lillies bloom the dollmaker all three were shot on location in those beautiful hills and cover the lives of simple-living but not simple-minded american folk a minimum of strong language and brief but pointed violence make this fairly-safe family viewing
most people especially young people may not understand this film it looks like a story of loss when it is actually a story about being alone some people may never feel loneliness at this character johnson reflected the total opposite of sandlers character fineman where johnson felt trapped by his blessings fineman was trying to forget his life in the same perspective jada is a wonderful additive to the cast and sandler pulls tears cheadle had the comic role and was a great supporter for see oscars somewhere here a very fine film if you have ever lost and felt alone this film will assure you that you're not
if you only read a synopsis of the plot this movie would sound like quite a typical one of the the story would seem quite contrived the subject matter maudlin the strength and beauty of this film is in the direct earthy performances of the have seldom seen jean harlow display such a range of feeling rich and subtle nuances float over her face if you watch their faces during the wedding ceremony in the chapel there is such an obvious depth of feeling between the principal characters the raw emotions are so sincerely portrayed so true the final sequence is almost unbearably poignant when clark gable looks down with such joy and surprise at his son lifts him up and proudly says my kid i couldn't help remember that mr own son was born to him posthumously this is one of the finest examples of depression era cinema
this is a really old fashion charming movie the locations are great and the situation is one of those old time preston sturgess movies fi you want to watch a movie that doesn't demand much other then to sit back and relax then this is it the acting is good and i really liked michael rispoli he was in rounders too and while you were sleeping the rest of the cast is fun just what happens when two people about to get married meet the one that they really love on the weekend that they are planning their own weddings i know sounds kooky but it is and what makes it fun to watch it will make your girl friend either hug you or leave you but at least you'll know
guys you got to watch this awesome movie at the end of this movie you will have a strong passion and profundity imbued into yourselves the acting of the two characters billy sunday and carl brashear deeply touches the heart from inside this movie is about principles dignity patriotism and honor you will hear chief carl brashear say the navy has greatest tradition of all honor practiced thoroughly by these two characters mere glances of these characters during the movie fills you with enthusiasm dialogue delivery of this movie is perfect you can't find any flaws in the dialogues what the master chief billy says roams in and out of your mind for a long time after watching the movie please watch this movie
i would say for time this movie was yes if you have no desire to become a christian then why bother watching it i saw this movie after i had already been saved and found it to be very moving i see now they have taken these movies to another level and have created the left behind run a close comparison and definitely are more modern to reach people i think in order to actually judge this movie you should see are or of them in the series if i am not use our comments to judge see the movie for yourself god will bless you if that is why you are watching them
for me this movie was powerful i don't want to be a spoiler but i had a friend years ago we were like brothers this movie brought back some vivid some reason i couldn't place my vote for this movie which would have been a i kept getting a message like no votes have been placed and yet i saw in the stats that there were will try again tomorrow flaws i overlooked it was the relationships between the characters that got me beautifully acted and real situations i've been in a couple of small gem of a movie just like spring forward is another overlooked gem i'm very glad movies like these are still being made about relationships between people well written sensitively unfolded with first-class acting and direction after all isn't that what all about
i first saw this movie about years ago and i was expecting something funny similar to i was blown away i was on the floor laughing my butt off this movie is so great way better than the characters the songs the plot everything top notch independent film that was given two thumbs up by siskel and egbert if two old white guys can understand the humour in this flick you know good
for me too this christmas special is one that i remember very fondly in i snatched up the cds i found of the soundtrack recording giving one to my sister and keeping the other for myself part of my christmas tradition now and i would love to be able to actually see the show again rather than just remember it as i has been noted elsewhere that john denver made a number of appearances on the muppet show and they did more than one special together the good rapport between denver and his fuzzy companions comes through clearly here in a charming and fun show that is good for all ages
shot into car from through the windscreen someone is playing someone else their latest song someone else didn't react according to the voice-over i just wonder how that came to be made there were too many scenes in this movie that i wondered about how come a camera was there if the scenes shot where the warhols descended on a bjm post-party are true then that was inexcusable exploitation to the max if not then it was a total fabrication either way it made me uncomfortable if that was the purpose all the way thru this movie i kept wondering how the footage came about taken at face value a nice portrait of the genius we all believe ourselves to be
i saw this independent film when it was in philadelphia and it was a pleasant surprise i left the theater with a smile on my face one of the things that made it so funny was that it was based on a true story it has some great character actors in it too mindy sterling is in it and is very good i loved her in austin powers howard hesseman is also terrific i remember him from head of the class i am tired of all the dark edgy movies that keep getting made this is fun and light and i can watch it with my family and not be embarrassed i keep checking to see when it will come out on dvd i will definitely buy it
i've seen this film literally over absolutely jam-packed with entertainment powers boothe gives a stellar performance as a fan of actors such as william shatner and ron liebmann the academy never thought an actor could capture the intensity like shatner and liebmann in those roles until i saw boothe as jim jones as far as i'm concerned powers boothe is jim film captures his best performance
after several extremely well ratings to the point of superb i was extremely pleased with the film the film was dark moving the anger the pain the guilt and a very extremely convincing had initially expected to see many special effects and like a caress it blew me away with the subtlety and the rightness of it brian i am again blown away with your artistry with the telling of the story and your care of the special effects you will go a long way my friend i will definitely be the president of your fan etebari the best actor award was the number one choice you made jr lopez look like a child compared to kasadya the acting story line the high quality filming and awesome effects it was fantastic i just wish it were longer i am looking forward to the dreamless with extremely high expectations
this movie is an eye opener for those who can only the glamorous lifestyles of the stars it tells you how people who would like to do good are not able to plus the bomb blast scene is very you read and are taught just does not raise your bp level by actors played their role very scenes may could have been avoided to include movie is quite adult in a movie that can be seen with is great
if i watch a movie and don't once look at my watch or clock to see how much longer it will be running or when i hope that the last scene wasn't the end of the movie got to be pretty good i'm not an movie internalist or cinema dissectionist i watch movies and if they keep me interested till the end then they are pretty good because some of the most critically acclaimed films bore me to death english patient shakespeare in love atonement crash this movie kept me interested and absorbed beginning to end acting is great story is absolutely original flash-back technique very affective there was a bit of citizen kane thrown in tho when hoffman trashes his apartment after tomei leaves him but i forgive that cause i see it as a homage to rather than a rip-off of orson
i loved this film i first saw it when i was which was only four years ago and i enjoyed it so much i brought my own copy the next day the comedy is well played by all involved i always have to rewind and rewatch the scene where mr tsanders explains why he found water at ft in one area and feet in another area also look for jason robards father who plays mr retch talent ran in that family
as i watched this movie and i began to see its characters develop i could feel this would be an excellent picture when you get that feeling and the movie indeed fills those expectations the experience is rare i had that very feeling throughout this movie robert deniro and cuba gooding junior played riveting and amazingly strong parts which were both oscar worthy the supporting cast was equally as strong creating a winning foundation for the picture to grow on i can say without any hesitation at all see this movie it will not disappoint
i don't think i could have enjoyed it more though certain things were disturbing i'm not going to say what if you haven't seen have to find out for yourself at any rate what movie can lack with robert downey puppy-dog eyes all-in-all the plot was developed sufficiently nothing seemed too rushed as movies like this tend to be the characters were like-able and there were plenty of hilarious scenes in it the idea over-all is that the story is very well tied together even if certain aspects may be matter of opinion but like i said before hard not to love any movie with robert downey jr
very intelligent humor excellent performing i can't believe how people could think it deserves a i hope this movie will be shown everywhere so everyone can enjoy it if you ever have the opportunity watch it don't miss it there is a part when the principal actors are driving and singing happy birthday and el payaso plinplin argentinian song for kids think it could also be south american i'm not sure this two songs that have the same melody but people don't usually realize that just grate i tried to write this in both spanish and english because an argentinian movie but the page wouldn't allow me hope you enjoy it
i first saw this at a foreign film festival a beautifully paced nail-biter about a plot to relieve the estonian treasury of a billion or so in gold all shot in a gritty grainy style that hollywood rarely uses but it captures the atmosphere of the newly emancipated baltic states beautifully tallin was actually looking a lot less grim in when i was a lot of humor and some romance too i don't want to spoil a number of startling yet logical surprises so i'll just say this heist film starts from a great script and the directing and performances are top notch darkness in tallin is simply the fastest and most nerve-racking example of its genre i'd put it up against rafifi topkapi and miles ahead of the new though not as glossy rent or buy it now
was blown away by this movie i've been renting on movielink for a bit and decided to check this movie out alot of boxing movies seem to overblow the blood in this movie it shows it at the amature level though i do wish that perhaps more attention would have been brought to perhaps her improving her grades the movie points out the problems some families face with was a bit concerned with the ending but the ending wasn't a disappointment think it was pretty clear by the title that she'd win what was unexpected was that the two of them got back together sort of at the the score for some of the scenes highly
i just saw this movie tonight opening night it was great i'm a big fan of sports movies and this was right up there as one of my favorites dennis quaid was great by the way mr quaid if you read sister lives in austin where you she was supposed to buy you a drink kinda stood you she didn't mean to c that going to believe that anyway a great movie everyone who likes a good sports movie should go out and see it c
loved the film this was my first glimpse at both reese witherspoon and jason london both of which are two of my favorites must say that no matter how many times i've seen this movie i can't help but tear up one of those movies that should become a classic for all
from the beginning of the show carmen was there she was one of the best characters why did they get rid of her the show not the same as before its way best episodes were with carmen in them you can't replace someone from the beginning that is like south park without kyle or play without chucky not right the niece who replaced her is just ugh awful she doesn't fit into the storyline at all she was one of the main characters and the niece can't replace her she was an awesome actress way better than the niece get her back or you'll lose a ton of viewers
one more of those brilliant young men who went all out and dared to make a teen romance can i actually call it it would invoke the devil out of its a micro budget but packed with such taste sensitiveness and maturity peter you deserve more admiration and once again for demonstrating to the powers that be in the industry that stereotypes can be flushed down the toilet one handful of rich characters low that too lighting worshippers of true indie cinema should watch more of this and stop know what
i like many horror fans have been force fed the same banal big budget hollywood remakes and mtv high school slasher tripe for the last years here at last is an original horror genre movie that ticks all the right want a hot lead actress you want vampires you want cool weapons you want cool vehicles and you want blood lots of it by the bucket load you got excellent fight choreography and a supporting role from the hammer horror scream queen herself stephanie beacham this really is fantastic low budget by opting to use mm stock and adding quality cg effects to the mix director james eaves has created something that feels much must for old school horror fans
i watched entranced and mesmerized by the vocal and physical acting the roles each character played were done with words every gesture the sunrise told it movie spoke to me it enlightened me to a different perception of a person who believes in mankind who believes in peace and gentle behavior i was also held in disbelieve by the sacrifices and human dignity was portrayed power without grace is demented and without feelings to want power at the cost of mankind is so unbelievable this movie made me so afraid for the people who are no longer in this world and it is with sadness that i think of them i like this movie for the conversations and face expressions to it all may this movie be blessed
this is not a movie you watch for entertainment at least most people i know would portraits the cruelty to both body and mind that happen in a war pretty well the characters seem plausible especially because you read their minds something more often found in books and rarely in movies however done very well in this piece i would place it next to all quiet on the western front and die brücke in terms of leaving a lasting wish i could screen it at school along with the other two movies however finding a copy of it showed to be pretty hard which is a shame
this wonderful little film has all of the elements that made the spaghetti western so exciting and fun great music one of the not the composer to work in the genre nora orlandi exciting action sequences very vicious ones for the day and beautiful scenery and sets in almeria spain of course it also has a very good story with a nice tragic romance edge to it the actors do marvelous truly standout performances from lawrence dobkin and rosalba neri the most vital role for a female in a spaghetti of cardinale in once upon a time in the west without posting any spoilers let me just say that this movie contains one of the best endings of any film i have ever seen
caught this film at the arizona international film festival i wasn't expecting a lot the director told me it was one of the best films submitted five minutes into it i was sold shot in b w on a shoestring budget this film is hilarious the acting is solid the writing is solid and the look of the film is solid the acting is probably the biggest revelation since most films shot on low budgets tend to have amateur or stagey acting not this one it features one of the most convincing endearing and funny portrayals of a character with syndrome i've ever seen the plot is convoluted without being confusing and raunchy without being gratuitous if you get the chance see this movie filmmakers like majkowski i got that right deserve the chance to strut their stuff to a wider audience
i won't give anything away by describing the plot of this film other than to say that it begins with the return to israel of a young blind woman whose closest friend and companion has just committed suicide it unfolds like a detective story as the blind woman tries to figure out why her friend ended her life as she pursues her investigation and the information accumulates it leads inexorably to a devastating conclusion the film is expertly paced and the acting especially by talia sharon as ya'ara the blind woman is excellent israeli film has definitely come of age and is now fully competitive with other foreign films though few have found a large audience in the
this is the weepy that beaches never was as much as i wanted to love beaches it always seemed too hurried for me to feel for it soundtrack is one of my favorite albums though stella on the other hand moves at a slower occasionally too slow pace and though somewhat manipulative in its tears-inducing tale about a self-sacrificial mother it works because bette and the rest of the cast turn in great performances
the subsequent two seasons of this original series was less than lacklustre the latter seasons disastrous reshuffle contributed to its three season short life span maybe if the plug was pulled after the first season it would've gained a cult from that the first season was truly hilarious witty clever with superb writing it was promising the first excellent brew had the right ingredients storyline and so forth plus a comedy about a paparazzi reporter was original to boot nora and her fellow photographers on the prowl night after night day after day for the lot of things don't make sense to me like how this show and another fav of mine gross pointe never made it if only the first seasons of the naked truth and grosse pointe were released on dvd please anyone out there
husbands beware is a remake of the shemp classic brideless groom the new cooking scene at the beginning of the film is great the stooges are always funny when they cook however after the first few minutes of cooking footage we cut to original footage of brideless groom one thing i noticed about these to remakes are that they do fit with the new story they do an insert shot if the old story line doesn't beware does have a new ending but i won't give it away to those who want to be out of stars
i think this is what this movie wants us to say at the end of the movie or damn australian i still don't know but what i know is that i really liked this movie but that couldn't be my favorite story with great actors but with a terrible end to make you cry and say oh so good still who made it what really happened that guy no answer to these movie with a good mark overall i give it a going on the
i love this show mr blick gordon and waffle are cats so different from each other yet they refer to themselves collectively as brothers i often find myself trying to imitate the tired sighing accent of their butler hovis or even the scottish borough of gordon there should be more episodes made about human kimberly the episode about the cats disguising themselves as pre-teen girls to gain admittance to human slumber party in order to get their thirsty paws on their favorite drink rootbeer is a hilarious classic we can't drink rootbeer in our house now without either doing the catscratch voices or the hanson brothers from the movie slap shot future classic where can i get the first two seasons on dvd
this film recently voted as an audience favorite at the palm springs international film festival is inspiring and moving a famous conductor forced to retire by illness returns to the small village of his birth to become the leader of the church choir and finally find fulfillment in his music drawing on sweedish traits of keeping things within oneself and of the insular character of a small swedish village this film develops each of its characters well superbly directed acted and sung it brought tears to many eyes and smiles to all hopefully it will find distribution in the united you can see it
i've seen this movie at least fifty times and after watching it last week for the first time in a long time i still felt story itself was incredible but came alive by expertise and the fabulous cast including whoopi goldberg oprah winfrey danny glover and margaret avery akosua busia deserved an oscar nomination for her short but powerful portrayal of experience every human emotion while watching this film i laughed cried and got angry like most great movies it was looked over by the academy with a host of nominations but no wins but this movie without a doubt is definitely one of the best films of all time
i love this movie it is great film that combines english and indian cultures with feminist-type issues such as girls wanting to play sports that were previously reserved for men it shows the struggles of both an indian person wanting to break outside her cultural barriers and women wanting to break outside the gender restrictions found in sports especially in england at the time i feel that the cultural struggles are more emphasized than the other contrast to the other comment i do not think this movie is anything like dirty dancing or any other such chick flick this move is loved by many types of people men and women young and old alike
i loved this movie for two reasons jeff combs is absolutely wonderful in it plays the role of the modern wizard to the hilt is absolutely adorable the movie helped to inspire a role-playing game i thoroughly enjoy mage the awakening i've shown it at various larp after-parties and always a big love and jeff-squeeing aside not exactly a masterpiece but well-done and thoroughly enjoyable the plot is fast-moving and engaging in its simplicity the special effects are pretty good for such a low budget and the script while nothing stellar was not too badly done and cheesy in all the right places a good way to spend an evening
tight script good direction excellent performances strong cast effective use of mcgann gives a detailed subtle performance as the man in the centre of a new murder investigation who may just have committed a similar murder is an interesting moral emotional journey happening with his character turner and it intersects with the journey undertaken by amanda burton inevitably they cross over who has done examination of why both in the past and in the present rather than who might have yielded a more interesting dostoyevskian story but hey
surprisingly well done for an independent film an nightmare paints a startling picture of what it would be like to suffer from insomnia wonderfully well written and directed it creates the atmosphere of a dream as the viewer is taken through one night in the life of an dominic monaghan as jack we get to see everything he sees as the long hours of a lonely night drag on the narration is almost hypnotizing and from the opening lines it is impossible to turn away fascinating and slightly disturbing it shows how someone copes with a lack of sleep balancing on the brink between sanity and twists and turns around every corner an nightmare is provocative and engaging it comes very highly recommended
this is a strong movie from a historical and epic perspective while the story is simple it is pure and straightforward in truth it is the standard story of a simple honorable man whose honor comes into conflict with the more educated and wealthier men of the vs rich honorable vs dishonorable a classic but well-told tale without much of the glitz of hollywood stinking up the points just because you can almost smell the people on the screen
i have to say seventeen missing is much better than i expected the perception i took from the previews was that it would be just humdrum but i was pleasantly surprised with this impressive pfeiffer is emilie a mom who insists her daughter lori moss not attend a so-called graduation party one weeknight but lori ignores her wishes and takes off for the party anyway when lori does not come home emilie knows something is wrong and she begins to have visions of her daughter and the events that led to her missing is better than so many other tv movies of this type as it is not so predictable pfeiffer is the reason to see this movie and most of it comes off as believable this lmn original movie premiered last night
i remember seeing this in a the salem movie theater i used to attend kiddie almost every saturday in dayton ohio when i was a young boy and have never forgotten it it simply amazed me and my friends i do wish there were some way i could see it again i have tried to find some compilation of shorts or something like that to no avail i only recently discovered that it was a cousteau film and that blew my mind even more how the heck he accomplished this is beyond my understanding the fish is actually in the mouth at one point if i remember correctly if anyone could help me find a way to see it again i would be extremely grateful
i remember that i was a child when i first saw this movie it was my first horror movie the reason why i can still remember some parts of it i don't remember much about acting nude scenes or other things but i do remember a male has head blown up with a grenade a male dismembered over a tree and a male run down by truck and shot in head schaefer kenny johnson and kevin mcparland i also remember the last scene when jennifer mcallister riped of the killer stomach to get the keys of the truck a movie that gives you the creep and worth a look but where do i find it how can i download it
i found this to be the most enjoyable muppets movie because i felt it was the most light-hearted and had the best comic delivery on most of its lines the muppets try to go on broadway to sell an original musical they've written but along the way they run into the usual problems including memory loss here while there aren't as many great cameos here as in the original muppets movie there are some including joan rivers and dabney coleman simply the timing and delivery of so many of the lines is great and the situations the muppets find themselves in are hilarious the original songs are also good here and the ending is satisfying there is not much else to say about the film but muppet fans should see it for sure it is the funniest muppet movie and is sure to be enjoyed by out of
heres a fun fact i was the baby in the movie the one in the crib i am years old now my parents took me to try out for the part we lived in texas at the think i only made like bucks for it but i wasn't in it very long my parents said i would cry when i was supposed to be happy and would be happy when i was supposed to cry i was all mixed up strange and funny fact i suppose and no i am not a child actress i am livin in san antonio workin at a walgreens i graduated here in texas but i lived in maryland most my life this movie is a great movie though good concept i have seen it several times in my short years
this is my all-time favorite fred astaire and ginger rogers film the dialogue between the two is so cute and funny and very clever not to mention this film contains some of the best songs recorded by the two like i'm putting all my eggs in one basket and face the music and dance if i remember correctly this was the film that introduced me to fred astaire so i suppose because of that it will always hold a special place in my heart for the sentimental but i'm woman so get over in all this film gets an from me the choreography was superb and also the fact that lucille ball is in it makes it even more awesome
i thought it was a pretty good movie and should have been released in theaters first it wouldn't have been a big blockbuster but it would have made some pretty good money the movie has suspense and makes you wonder just how much of this is going on in the real world justin timberlake did a good job i wasn't expecting justin timberlake to do that good a job considering it is his first movie he did a good job this is a movie that is good to pick up and watch when you just don't know what you want to rent that night it should go pretty well the cast was great so i highly recommend that everyone checks this movie out
i admit the first time i watched even cowgirls get the blues i didn't think it was very memorable in any regard but now after viewing it the time i admit that it has very much grown on me the characters of sissy ms jellybean and the countess have become very endearing and the romance between sissy and jellybean seems very sweet though the plot is very weak i think the satirical humor more than makes up for it then the kick-ass soundtrack which features the tremendously talented lang reminds me a little of patsy cline at her best i can't think of any movie that has grown on me after an inauspicious first impression as much as cowgirls has
i got a good laugh reading all the idiotic comments for this obvious that those people who criticized the movie never seen it or were stupid enough to pay to see best reason to watch was on the elvira show a few years back elvira delivered the movie with as many laughs as one an ok monster flick compared to the hundreds of horrendous american flicks made way better
i saw the the bourne ultimatum last summer with a friend and wow i had already seen the first two films and i liked them but ultimatum i damon plays jason bourne a amnesia suffering cia agent on the run trying to discover who he i already said i loved this movie from start to finish no plot holes slow scenes everything was paced just right and it fit in well with the other films but in all senses it was much stunts car chases actors and effects i've seen in an action movie all summer due to spider-man pirates etc but i it wasn't just action in this film jason doesn't just kill and run he has a soul and the audience feels for him so drama is included but that doesn't slow it all the threequels that came out last summer this was the best
this movie has great stars in their earlier years ingor stevens never looked prettier yul brynner was a very convincing jean lafitte conflicted about his piracy and desiring to keep neutrality with the united states charlton heston did a pretty good job as andrew jackson but some moments were a bit stilted really a good flick for students to learn that part of our history and it shows that all happy endings do not include the lovers getting together with each the happier ending is that they sail away and find partners of similar background who will understand them better in the long run i have viewed it every year at least twice for years now and though it is not the best movie i've ever seen i love it every time
nice movie with a great soundtrack which spans through the rock landscape of the and radiofreccia describes a generation it describes life in a small village near correggio of ligabue the singer who wrote the book that inspired the movie it describes life of young people and their problems relating to the world it reminds of trainspotting with a bit of italian touch
as romantic comedies go this was a cute and winning one i thought that the writing could have been stronger to build up the final connection a bit better but that is not a huge tripping point but amanda detmer and scott wolf give nice performances and are as charming as ever these are two of my favorite actors and i was just glad to see them cast as romantic leads i hope to see them cast in more projects this movie won't change your life but is is sweet warm and winning not a bad thing to be at all
i love this movie it was one of my favorite movies the action never stops the whole movie was done very well the ending is really good ontop of it being action filled they even have a surprised put in there for you when i saw what the movie was about on the internet i was kind of not sure if i wanted to see this movie but sense i am such a big luke perry fan i decided to give it a chance i am glad that i did give it a chance because this was a very well though out movie it was very original whoever thought up this movie gets a standing ovation from me the acting was great luke perry did an excellent job once again i give this movie the highest rating
as a pokémon fan i enjoyed this movie very much it introduces new legendary pokémon each movie does and adds depth to the relationships between its characters i however do not expect those who are not pokémon fans to enjoy includes most adults some of the lines were corny but that can be somewhat unavoidable when dubbing the movie over to english the animation was beautiful although there were a couple parts that did not look good and although the villain is kind of corny i think that the movies have done a good job of cycling through different types of villains and i guarantee you that they aren't all like this one those who did not like it i say to each his own but pokémon fans will love it
found this flick in a videostore it cost to buy the whole movie stinks really bad the so-called colonel who would the hero here if the cover could have been trusted must be in his eighties and is barely able to walk he nevertheless manages to shoot some of the dumbest ninjas in the world then the story leaves the colonel which makes sense given the old inability to do anything worth mentioning a now two terrifyingly eighties-looking guys take over in what must have been some sort of story i got lost a hundred times but didn't mind because the movie is so bad real fun to watch zero-budget trash with actors not deserving that name go check it out
this miracle of a movie is one of those films that has a lasting long term effect on you i've read a review or two from angry people who i guess are either republicans or child beaters and their extremist remarks speak of the films power to confront people with their own darkest secrets no such piece of art has ever combined laughter and tears in me before and that is the miracle of the movie the realism of the movie and performance by bret carr is not to be missed the very nature of almost interactive effect will cause people to leave the theater either liberated or questioning their very identity bravo on the next level of cinema
yes this is one of the great musical movies i grew up with with such great entertainers as frank sinatra and gene kelly not to mention the petite and glorious voice of kathryn grayson the music and dancing is superb i understand frank took lessons from kelly and there is kelly dancing with jerry mouse which is quite unique for the time betty garrett plays the waitress who falls in love with sinatra she is one of great underrated stars i saw this again on tv and as well have it in my old vcr tapes never get tired of these old musicals whatever happened to hollywood
this is a great movie i like it where ning climbs down to get his ink and the skeletons chase him but luckily he dodged them opened the window and didn't even notice them xiao qian is very pretty too when he stuck the needle up ma butt its hysterical and when he is saying love is the greatest thing on earth while standing between two swords is great too then also the part where he eats his buns while watching thew guy kill many people then you see him chanting poems as he ran to escape the wolves the love scenes are romantic xiao qian and ning look cute together add the comic timing the giant tongue and u have horror romance comedy all at once not to mention superb special effects for the
this is one of the greatest child-pet movies ever created i cry every time i see shadow yelling wait wait for me peter as the family car is pulling away this is a must see if you love animals best movie ever the lines in the movie are sometimes stupid like when sassy says to chance rule and dogs drool lines like this i could do without but when i was six i bet i loved that line the storyline may seem hooky to some but i like it shadow as the older dog preparing chance to take over for him when gone is really moving when you think about it it reminded me of my childhood dog i think everyone can find a piece of themselves in homeward bound
the color purple is about the struggles of life and the love that helps those people strongly affected by the struggles of life every character had an element of the color purple in them the movie touches on love lost hope hate and triumph whether it be celie having lived through hell and losing her sister and shug coming into her life to show her love again albert not being man righting his wrong toward celie shug shunned by her father and confesses to him in the end sofia and her stubborness good and bad and even nettie they had their emptiness and hardship through the film but was overcome in the end and the sign of a good movie good job to all the cast and crew
no message no symbolism no dark a wonderful melange of music nostalgia and good fun put to-gether by people who obviously had a great time doing it a refreshing antidote to some of the pretentious garbage being ground out by the studios of course anything with the incomparable judi dench is worth watching and cleo brilliant jazz singing is a bonus this lady is in the same league as the late ella this goes on my movie shelf to be pulled out again anytime i feel the need for a warm experience and a hearty good natured chuckle just a wonderful film
i was initially dubious about this movie because of the subject but the richly drawn characters the fabulous scenes of the buffalo hunt and the dramatic conclusion make it well-worth watching i initially had trouble distinguishing between the two buffalo hunters but as the movie progressed they increasingly distinguished themselves i am still haunted by the final scene
i liked this movie it was pretty cool it has it all cars gun shooting fighting and even a token girl it does not excel in any of this things with the exception of the cars a bit of shooting a bit of fighting a bit of smooching around and of car with a great chase near the end the jump you may say is impractical but according to our good friends here at the imdb it is possible so the movie as bad as people are painting it it has some quality and i liked to watch it in fact i loved the film and i need to turn off my brains to watch it i always thinking is this possible or tramp like that in
i absolutely loved this movie when i was a kid i cried every time i watched it it wasn't weird to me i totally identified with the characters i would love to see it again hope i wont be disappointed pufnstuf rocks i was really drawn in to the fantasy world and to me the movie was loooong i wonder if i ever saw the series and have confused them the acting i thought was strong i loved jack wilde he was so dreamy to an year old i first saw the movie not in i can still remember the characters vividly the flute was totally believable and i can still feel the evil woods witchy poo was scary i wouldn't want to cross her path
claire denis debut is both a brave and self-assured one in this depiction of life towards the end of french colonialist cameroon she explores the relationships between men and women black and the black servant protée as the primary object of desire and oppression the film enters taboo territory from the beginning denis builds a picture of life through a series of character relationships that keep the informed viewer fixed to the screen the mood of the film is captured perfectly by the camera-work and of great discourse
i second the motion to make this into a movie it would be great i was also amazed at the storyline and character build in this game i have played it again and again times just to try something different and it gets more interesting every time final fantasy eat your heart out this should be made into a movie if anyone out there wants some help to start a petition to have this made into a movie please contact me i would love to help with that project any day the graphics are great for and even make you forget it is most of the time the multitude of side quests makes it different every time you play
meatball machine is an amazing splatter film it has an original plot with young love buckets of blood and weird alien creatures that mutate people into freakish robotic war the film isn't for everyone people who love splatter films or the movie tetsuo the iron man will applaud special effects can be cheesy at some points of the film but your not exactly suppose to take the film very all in all a lot of fun well if you find budding romantics infested with slimy tumor like gobbles who seek to destroy each other in bloody alien oozing battles
broken bow takes us back to where it all began set years in our future and years before kirk spock and mccoy this installment of the star trek franchise is in my opinion the first series since tos to recapture the feelings of wonder danger and excitement of going where no man has gone before scott bakula is perfectly cast as jonathan archer the first captain of the first star ship enterprise he and the entire cast truly show a true reverence for the star trek legacy john billingsley is brilliant as the alien dr phlox and jolene blalock is totally luscious as the tempting but logical vulcan science officer t'pol broken bow is in my opinion the best premier episode of any of the treks and i believe gene roddenberry would surely be proud
i can admit that the screenplay isn't very good and that it has some slow parts but all of you critics of this movie need to learn how to have some fun first of all the performances are great douglas kim basinger kiefer sutherland and eva longoria michael douglas proves he has still got it and kim basinger plays a very interesting character as the cheating wife kiefer sutherland and eva longoria play the dynamic duo both adding their incredible talent to the pot and second of all this movie is the most fun i have had in years in a theodore its plain and simple if you want to go to the movies and have a lot of fun see the sentinel
going berserk is actually one of the funniest candy films i have ever seen period sure kinda low budget but a non-stop comedic tour de force there are tons of memorable quotes for instance when his soon-to-be father-in-law asks him how much he earns candy says oh i pull down anywhere between thirty thousand dollars a year sir oh course it is delivery that sells it just classic stuff eugene levy also turns in a hilarious performance as a sleazy filmmaker a clip of his horrible low budget movie kung fu u will have you if you are a candy fan and want to rediscover a forgotten gem i can't recommend this movie enough
if you're amused by straight-faced goings-on that are logical within a given illogical situation you'll enjoy this whimsical spanish woman enters a small café the scene looks ordinary but the counterman customers and two musicians seem somehow oddly the musicians play and one man begins to sing the title song dancing across table tops with musical-comedy gestures the customers at first immobile at intervals chime in but gamely with phrases from the song read from slips of paper in their palms on and off they jump up and dance but earnestly in choreographed motions like backup why the woman wonders the answer is revealed as the jacket opens and she sees strapped across his chest just before the explosive if you don't catch the ironical lyrics the situation-perfect performances should give you a grin and a chuckle i'd love to see it again
well this movie was probobly one of the funniest scary movie i have ever seen the effects are so bad you just have to laugh and the acting well lets say its no mel gibson but gary browning who plays an police officer is so damn bad he becomes good i dont know how but he him self makes this movie a you must see it if your in to movies cause its bloody and funny at the same time killer movie
the zenith of two brilliant careers david lynch better known for less accessible material crafts a delicate and exquisite story around the most unlikely premise a man travels to see his estranged brother having no other means of transportation his journey takes him over six weeks on a lawn mower richard farnsworth in his last film delivers a stunningly layered and nuanced performance in the starring role achingly beautiful in its exultation of small things straight story is a classic cinema experience that must not be missed sissy spacek is notable as daughter an impaired middle-aged woman living with the loss of her children
i show this film to university students in speech and media law because its lessons are timeless why speaking out against injustice is important and can bring about the changes sought by the oppressed why freedom of the press and freedom of speech are essential to democracy this is a must-see story of how apartheid was brought to the attention of the world through the activism of steven biko and the journalism of donald woods it also gives an important lesson of free speech you can blow out a candle but you can't blow out a fire once the flame begins to catch the wind will blow it higher biko by peter gabriel on shaking the tree
stumbling upon this hbo special late one night i was absolutely taken by this attractive british executive transvestite i have never laughed so hard over european history or any of the other completely worthwhile point eddie izzard made i laughed so much that i woke up my mother sleeping at the other end of the house
i must say that i really had no idea that i was going to sit down and watch this movie i guess it was the fact that i had nothing better to do between class but for once a tv movie caught my interest more importantly helen hunt caught my eye i really wasn't a big fan of hers prior to this film sure i liked twister and as good as it gets but something about this movie really did it for me i would now see myself as a huge fan this movie comes with high marks give it a chance it won't let you down
kudos to the writers of this film for creating a supremely engaging drama the curious character development is indicative of a nuanced and well schooled writing team the audience member cannot but help but to feel that must make wrenching emotional decisions pitting the cerebral against the libidinal the viewer has an opportunity to develop the character herself though her predictions are rarely is also due to the filmmakers for breathing life into the setting the wood-shop is transformed into a unique persona as the film unfolds with its own traits faults a variety of highly charged relationships and of course a fate inexorably tied to that of the other sure to catch this one at your local art-house
with the advent of the imdb this overlooked movie can now find an interested audience why because users here who do a search on two-time academy award winner glenda jackson can find the return of the soldier among her credits so can those checking out oscar winner julie christie fans of ann-margret can give the title a click as will those looking into the career of the great alan bates not to mention the added bonus of a movie with supporting heavyweights ian holm and frank finlay any movie with so many notables in it is rewarded by the imdb given all the cross-referencing that goes on here so why isn't this movie out on dvd don't the producers realize the internet movie database is a marketing gift for such a film and the return of the soldier is definitely a gem waiting to be discovered get with it people
this short film that inspired the soon-to-be full length feature spatula madness is a hilarious piece that contends against similar cartoons yielding multiple writers the short film stars edward the spatula who after being fired from his job joins in the fight against the evil spoons this premise allows for some funny content near the beginning but is barely present for the remainder of the feature this running time is absorbed by some odd-ball comedy and a small musical number unfortunately not much else lies below it the plot that is set up doesn't really have time to show but surely follows it plot better than many high-budget hollywood films this film is worth watching at least a few times take it for what it is and don't expect a deep story
i am a fairly big fan of most of the films that have been based on stephen books this one rates as one of the scariest and most have just finished rewatching it for about the tenth time and i still find it heart-wrenching as well as scene where gage is on a sure collision course with the monster truck is one which stands out and the no fair uttered by little miko hughes near the end is a touch of
i haven't seen bsg i tried to watch it once in the middle of the show but couldn't get into it however i saw caprica rebirth yesterday i felt a little lost so i decided to watch the pilot today and i must say i was pleasantly surprised i think this is a promising show and the only side effect it had on me is that now i want to watch bsg as what i really liked is that i didn't have to be a hardcore bsg fan to understand going on in caprica from what i have read in the net they were trying to reach the female population since bsg reached way more men and at least in my case it i suggest that if you are trying to watch the show do it from the beginning starting with the pilot
well this is probably one of the best movies i've seen and i love it so much that i've memorized most of the script the scene in the storage unit when jerry lee breaks wind and even with the script in my head i still like to watch it for jerry lee that german shepherd is hysterical and really is put to the test to see smarter the tag line holds true as well not to mention the acting is great though christine tucci sounds different in a whisper filmography under csi if you don't know what i mean too bad that this movie only contained the single issue dooley and jerry lee had to work with it would have been pretty cool to see the tricks that zeus and welles had up their sleeve
i was treated to a viewing of cracker bag last night before a preview screening of holes i don't know who decided to show it but i'm so very glad they did cracker bag is an absolute gem a snapshot of australia in the early as seen through a eye the conversations between eddie and her brother were hilarious and as with the rest of the film so true to life each shot brought a great sense of nostalgia as it reminded me of my own childhood the same age as the director probably helps a little and the audio multiplied the feeling i only hope i get to see cracker bag again some day
i have to say i totally loved the movie it had funny moments some heartwarming parts just all around good me personally really liked the movie because something that finally i can relate to my childhood this movie in my opinion is geared more towards the young gay population it shows how a young gay boy would be treated while growing up all the taunting name-calling and not knowing is something i like most other young feminine boys will always remember and now finally a movie that illustrates how hard it really is to grow up gay so i would definitely recommend seeing this movie probably shouldn't really watch it until a person is old and mature enough to understand it
i watched this movie when i was almost quite a kid and naturally was moved to tears by this story of a fox family the fantastic scenery at hokkaidô the excellent storytelling and last not least the wonderful soundtrack provide a rare intimacy with the protagonists i am still searching for some copy of the gorgeous soundtrack to german viewers it might be useful to know that the defa-dubbing is the only one worth listening to i taped both and br but i keep viewing the first one only
citizen x tells the real life drama of the search for a serial killer dubbed the rostov ripper this great film shows the long journey it took to try to apprehend a killer the film shows how politics may haver helped the killer to continue his rampage for over years over victims mostly women and children the performances of stephen rea as the lead detective and donald sutherland as the overall investigation lead was superb jeffrey demunn as the ripper andrei romanovich chikatilo this is the type of film which will mesmerize you and immediately have you on the internet researching the real case this a film not to be missed it debuted i believe on hbo and never did get a theatrical release to my understanding great film
this is a very funny movie i have no idea whether it translates well into other languages or not however i do think men all over the world can identify with frank and his thoughts to some extent these thoughts are hugely entertaining and women will also enjoy this movie i'm cast members perform well and this film could have been a tremendous hit all over the world if it was made in england or the us but for those of you who are fortunate enough to understand swedish you are in for a recommended
holes is not your average disney very very fun even for adults who usually cringe at the cutesy focus-group designed family entertainment that uncle studio passes off as live-action perhaps the secret of this success is in its faithfulness to the original book which is a little bit darker than your average kid stuff the action begins when stanley yelnats is sent to a boys prison camp where all the inmates are forced to dig holes under the desert sun as a form of rehibilitation but as the story progresses tale becomes interwoven with that of a legendary treasure and this adventure becomes ten times more fun than any disney movie about an all-boy prison camp has any right to be jon voight is especially nasty and colorful and sigourney weaver is beautiful as always
i don't know if this is a sitcom or not but i agree that this is one of the greatest television shows ever great that this show still airs and i love michelle cute on the episodes when she was a baby and she talked and she sometimes said something funny show can relate to children and teens and well families as they struggle through rough times and try to work it out as a family i don't know who would ever turn down an opportunity to watch this show with someone love the episode when i think her name is dd the older girl accidentally stole a sweatshirt and she learned a lesson about stealing that was a great episode an example that this tv show shows the family working things out as a recommend this show for everyone
this show is wonderful it has some of the best writing i ever seen it has brilliant directing by dvid trainer who also directed another smart television series called boy meets show is with out a dought one of the greatest like company roseanne and the famous cosby show this will be on television for a long time to perfectly crafted jokes to the great performances you would only dream of this is a wonderful show for people who lived in the seventies and the people who didn't this show appeals to the young and the young at heart a perfect show
after the initial shock of realizing the guts of mr branagh to film this i was literally shaking with the excitement of having this epic just ahead of me i was not disappointed so true to shakespeare and yet so accessible it blew my mind i always enjoy seeing or rather listening to branagh and it made me this movie dubbed in other countries that would be like painting a moustache on the mona lisa
adam sandler is usually typecast in in a deeply moving there are people who showed courage facing post september plays widower who is lonely and lost in his own practicing his old college wants to catch up on old in rain also gets emotional and withdrawn in stressful to be a comfort and psychological crutch for him to lean looks certain pleasure and ease missing in his also feels unhappy and unsatisfied in his the same also wants to make sure his friend does not fall through the social came away from this a different outlook and more sympathetic compassion for grieving families
i loved this movie i am biased seeing as i am a huge disney fan but i really enjoyed myself the action takes off running in the beginning of the film and just keeps going this is a bit of a departure for disney they don't spend quite as much time on character development husband pointed this there are no musical numbers it is strictly action adventure i thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone who loves disney be they young or old
the pilot is extremely well done it lays out how the characters bond in future episodes i don't think anyone could have created a better pilot for this show it displays remarkable creativity on the writers part although not everything was straightened out because it was the very first episode a lot of events that happen in future seasons were demonstrated in the pilot an example would be ross and rachels future relationship even though the nervousness of a first episode appeared it was overcome by an amazing plot and outstanding cast great start to an unbeatable comedy
what an awesome movie it was very scary great acting well-written nice plot twists interesting characters very good direction and a surprise ending that will leave you with a smile on your face this is one popcorn horror flick that may not be appealing to non-horror fans but is still one of the best thrillers out there today i highly recommend it to only fans the horror an actor or actress featured in out of i am sick and tired of people comparing this and other modern horror movies with scream ya know what they didn't want to be like scream like oh they copied scream well if i am not mistaking scream also copied other movies too in fact just about every horror movie copied an earlier one scream however was a good film but still stop comparing and enjoy it for what it and rent this
the movie within the movie a concept done many times in the history of cinema it is accomplished here as well as in you love carmen you'll love this you love flamenco you'll love this plot of the classic opera is played out in the actual rehearsal of the opera by a flamenco troupe the music is authentic the direction you like dancing you'll love this is tragedy there is passion there is
a pleasant surprise i expected a further downgrade along the line the rock air especially for such an overhyped film perhaps the reason so few approved of this new type of bruckheimer fare clever dialogue instead of snappy one-liners decent instead of shake-n-bake stereotypes and when the chase came you really thirsted for it fanboys expecting an armageddon rollercoaster stay away this is one for the more intelligent action fans it didn't even bother me jolie appeared so little
very possibly one of the funniest movies in the world oscar material trey parker and matt stone are hilarious and before you see this i suggest you see south park one of the funniest cartoons created buy it you will laugh every time you see it pure stroke of genius if you don't think its funny then you have no soul or sense of humor out of
shintarô katsu who played the blind swordsman zatoichi in a total of movies ends the hanzo trilogy with this excellent film in which he gets to make love to a ghost mako midori big stick used often in the pursuit of justice is retired was his usual impudent self as he pursued those who would steal from the treasury to lend at usurious amounts to those who could not afford to usual amazing swordplay and skill of the big guy was present along with the going to miss him
pressburger and greatest movie david niven plays the raf bomber pilot who misses his own death but is granted a second chance at life when heaven notices that he is awol and dispatches an angel to investigate the scene when the young soldiers men and women black and white all killed in action arrive in heaven to be processed for eternal life is unbearably poignant watch out too for roger livesey a deeply under appreciated actor and kim hunter as the love interest of course zira in planet of the apes incidentally steven spielberg cast the actress who played the chief angel byron as the elderly wife of the eponymous private in saving private ryan half a century later an act that speaks volumes for his cinematic literacy
according to the director this movie was popular in asia it is somewhat difficult to take these mats helge movies seriously since most of his films are shot on a very tight budget almost no usd at all but it is fascinating to establish that mats helge eventually completes something which can be called an action movie the ninja mission is i think the best one among all movies directed by him some special effects are quite enjoyable this is not a b or c movie it is a z movie but an enjoyable and fun z movie
great to see jorja fox in a role where she gets to smile a lot also loved hearing her sing nice change to see her out of her roles the movie itself was entertaining but it seemed skip some explanation in a lot of parts several of the characters seemed to be miserable one minute and happy the next and it was left up to your imagination to figure out why each character was quirky though and in some cases i couldn't wait to see what they would do next or hear what they would say next this movie wasn't full of squeaky clean people but rather complicated realistic people who could make mistakes feel bad about them and then find a way to fix them
now this is what i'd call a good horror with undertones this nice low-budget french movie caught my attention from the very first scene this proves you don't need wild fx or lots of gore to make an effective horror plot revolves around cellmates in a prison and each of these characters their motives become gradually more interesting as the movie builds up tension to the finale most of the action we see through the eyes of carrere who has just entered prison and has to get used to living with these other won't say much because this movie really deserves to be more widely seen there a few flaws though the fx are not that good but they're used effectively the plot leaves some mysteries open and things get very confusing towards the end but malefique redeems itself by the time thought his was a very good movie
fred gwynne al lewis sid caesar and yvonne de carlo star in this funny funny movie the late fred gwynne is truly wonderful as herman munster who lives with grandpa munster lewis wife lily de carlo and his son and daughter sid caesar is hilarious as the owner of a wax museum that has a whole section dedicated to the munster family when the wax figures of herman and grandpa begin to terrorize the town everyone blames the two the two now have to clear their names before too late you'll laugh out loud just like i did
i loved this movie you have to respect midgets that dressed up like tiny martians sure the story may have been thin at times but you can't take away from the way it was done i used to watch this over and over again when i was its a kids movie and besides it has some of the greatest quotes ever home on the range rendition is awesome well done if you ask me of
i'll keep it short and brief the people who wrote the story lines for this show are genius the actors are just perfect for the roles they play character is legendary and they have so much chemistry on screen which makes it what it is a very successful i saw first saw the new episodes which is probably going back just over months i wondered what had happened to paul i was gutted to find out that he had died when i browsed google he was so funny and played his character to perfection an over-protective dad who likes to keep his daughters out of the limelight and away from comedy i think has gone from strength to strength even without paul in i think most people would enjoy this watching it
i loved this movie and i am one of the older people who is not supposed to enjoy it or so it seems no this movie is not deep who cares these kinds of movies never are but strangely there is a message in it that we each have the potential to be whatever we want to posey is great in this movie i've always thought that she bears some resemblance facially to katharine hepburn so great to see that both hepburn and posey made movies about librarians is the desk set all librarians especially those with a sense of humor should see party gave this movie an it is not by any means a great film by cinematic standards although there are some nice shots in it but it is incredibly charming and entertaining
beyond the excellent the predictable drama lies an essential message in the leads all the way in order for the voice to harmonise with other in in order to approach discover the needs of any situation or it appears that the script writers are conveying a leads to an awareness of self it awakens the other senses especially vision expands the soul too can be discovered the artistry of this movie as it is in heaven magnificently displayed the unfolding of only its joy ultimately the hope of life all this by the leading first instruction to the leads all the way
dudley moore is fantastic in this largley unknown classic this film is very witty film that relies hugely on the actors talent without dudley moore john gielgud liza minnelli and a few others this film could have been a disaster it is not always well shot and at times has some very corny music that tries to force a mood music at the wedding fight but the acting overcomes it the character arthur is hilarious with his drunken comments but he develops well into a more mature well rounded character as he learns to live by his own free will the end is fairly corny though i wont give it away but it could be improved worth seeing many times
i've waited to see this movie for a long time and at last i could manage to see it in istanbul film festival maybe because i expected too much from this film and why i was slightly disappointed i was not the best movie from korea but still it is really worth subject was nice and the film makes you keep watching without getting bored though it is long but there are gaps in the movie and you jump from one point to another however the acting of jeon do-yeon is incredibly beautiful it was was one of the best performances in the early cinema history and i think this movie wouldn't be that nice if she was not in the leading role
this is a great movie to see with your girlfriend my friend and i both love dance and ran into this movie at the video store we had to get it with no violence and such a warming story its a great movie to relax to and just enjoy your night i would recommend this movie to any family or just a bunch of girls looking for a cute movie
this is the best mob film ever made it deserved more then what it got at the oscars nominated for things like its score art direction supporting role this film could have easily been nominated for best picture director actor supporting actor and law and won hanks gives one of his best performances and the kid who played michel jr was so good that i'm surprised i don't see him in more movies today critics themselves didn't give this film enough credit but besides the incredible performances another real star of this film is the incredible music this was by far the best score of the year it was nominated but didn't win this is a great film that should be seen by everyone my
this movie surprised me some things were clicheish and some technological elements reminded me of the movie enemy of the state starring will smith but for the most part very good mix with jamie foxx and comedian mike epps and the wannabe thugs julio and ramundo some comic relief this is a movie you can watch over again-say some wednesday night when nothing else is on i gave it a for entertainment value
a life is like a favorite candy bar chock-full of great little bits that add up to something really story couldn't have been better clever has heart and every character has a nice arc growth or change by comparison the only characters in toy story to have an arc are buzz who learns to love being a toy and woody who overcomes his resentment of buzz there are tons of laughs and cute moments in a life all of the actors turn in great voice work and the animation both the motion and detail is serious movie buff doesn't throw around lightly but this movie certainly deserves the i gave it
have just seen the australian premiere of shower at the sydney film festival the program notes said it was a perfect delight made touching amusing dramatic and poignantly meaningful i couldn't agree more i just hope the rest of the festival films come up to this standard of entertainment and i look forward to seeing more chinese films planned to be shown in sydney in the coming months
russell my fav is gorgeous in this film but more than that the film covers a tremendous range of human passion and sorrow everything from marriage to homosexuality is addressed and respected the film makes the viewer realize that tolerance of other humans provides the route to saving humanity fabulous love story between lachlin and lil i replay their scenes over and over again anyone who has ever been in love will empathize with these people all characters are cast and portrayed excellently
young erendira and her tyrranical grandmother provide for a great fantasy from the new world this interpretation of gabriel garcia incréible y triste historia da la cándida eréndira may not rub marquez purists the right way eventhough the story stays intact and still carries the full force of the work the strength of this film is in its acting especially papas as the grandmother marquez fans and marquez novices alike will enjoy this movie for its real gritty brand of witt
the ladies man is laugh out loud funny with a great diverse cast as well as having some very stupid but excellent scenes the funniest love song ever is his usual quality self in a brilliant side meadows plays an idiot surprisingly well and has written himself some of the funniest lines you'll find in any comedy out is definitely worth a purchase as watching it every months or so will lead to you still laughing as hard as you did first time am distraught to think at the time of writing this that it has a meagre and i urge you to vote remember theres more motion in the ocean
this is one of my favorite family movies loved it when i was little and it still holds up with me now that i'm older i still laugh at all the same old jokes and might even shed a tear a times i never have much cared for animals talking or at least un-animated ones but this one i'll stand up for a pretty old movie but it will always hold a place in my aren't any other live animal movies that i can think of at the moment that i even could compare with let alone like as much as this one i might be giving too much praise to this movie but i don't think show i really holds that great message that home is where the heart is or at least the message i gained from it definitely recommended for a good old family movie night
this movie should be required viewing for all librarians or would-be librarians all of the best lines are directly related to librarianship the public library vs academic library argument is a classic argument waged among librarians and library school students it also breaks many librarian stereotypes librarians might even be capable of having fun even if they don't have sex in the romance languages section best movie about librarians desk set with katherine hepburn and spencer tracy of course
this is a strange cerebral surreal esoteric film if there is such a thing as intellectual horror cinema this film is it i started to get scared and wish there was someone else watching it with me and it barely has a plot i'm going to have to see this film again multiple times before i feel i really understand it if you're the kind of person who likes my dinner with andre and films by godard or if you do a lot of mind-altering drugs you will probably enjoy this film wow
normally the best way to annoy me in a film is to include some reference to orson welles but here is a sci-fi comedy quoting the war of the worlds broadcast and it is gold the very concept of a small bunch of and stupid aliens being mistaken as kids in halloween dress is magnificent don't be fooled by the notion that because it seems like a kids movie it is unsophisticated it isn't a lot of hidden treasure a gem
after chicago i was beginning to lose all respect for richard gere and then along came the flock just so far a nice smile and a couple of stock facial gestures can get you but he proved to me that finally gotten hold of his craft and can act with the best of them clare danes was also super as his some have suggested there was too much unnecessary violence but i don't see it that way nothing i saw detracted from the power of this film i was really shocked i hadn't heard of it being released in theaters and came across it at blockbuster instead really an exceptional film with just the right blend of action suspense thrills and social consciousness as good as well maybe and you'll see better acting out of gere than ever gotten out of pitt
i so love this movie the animation is great a pokémon movie the cgi looks so awesome i love the music in the movie so great they kept the japanese for the story its great it has a great feeling of friendship celebi is a very cute and powerful pokémon ash is really great in this movie and i like his friendship with sam the only thing i didn't like was appearance he just suddenly pops up helps ash co a bit and leaves they could have made his part in the movie a little overall awesome movie can't wait to own the usa version on dvd
this is one of the great movies of the in my collection that i think about all the time running man is one of best and most different films even to this day and when i first saw the running man i was so excited to see a movie like this i just adore all of the fights and this is truly a special movie it also has jesse ventura the legendary professor toru tanaka sven-ole thorsen the beautiful maria conchita alonso yaphet kotto kurt fuller richard dawson and thomas rosales jr who seems to always like death in his movies because he has been killed in such films as universal solder the lost world robo cop predator and among others all arnold fans should love this film from the beginning to the end because its action packed star filled and its one its one of best to date
i watched this film so many times through my child hood that even to this day i can pretty much re-sight all of the dialogue and when i watch it now it just makes me happy and surprisingly still laugh i think amazing how they managed to train animals especially the cat to the extent that they are able to play the main role of a feature film however watching it now i can also unfortunately notice that it isn't the masterpiece i once thought it was but i prefer to remember how i felt about it when i was younger watching it on vhs on my fist tv that would cloud the image in yellow and and bearing in mind it is a film that is why i would still definitely give it
it seems to be a perfect day for swimming a normal family wants to gain advantage from it and takes a trip to the beach unfortunately it happens that the father is trapped under a pier and neither his wife nor the small son is able to help him out of this whereas the tide is rising the woman stanwyck takes the car and searches for sturges short movie minutes is powerful because of unanswered questions stanwyck finds a guy who could help but there is a price she has to pay for this there is a double question the movie poses how far would you go to help the man that you love and on the other hand observing behaviors towards the stranger does she really love her husband like a good short story this movie leaves the viewer to himself with questions he can only answer himself
sniper gives a true new meaning to war movies i remember movies about vietnam or wwii lots of firing everybody dies bam bam sniper takes war to a new level or refinement the movie certainly conveys all of the emotions it aims for the helplessness of humans in the jungle the hatred and eventual trust between beckett and miller and the rush of the moment when they pull the trigger a seemingly low-budget film makes up for every flaw with action suspense and thrill because when it comes down to it just one shot one kill
i hadn't laughed this hard for a movie in a really long time the garbage that hollywood has been putting out lately drives me up a wall this one was definetely fresh and witty if you look at the demographic figures for the ratings only a few women have voted i don't want to ruin the movie for you but i'm sure that every guy who saw this ran to their computers to rate it and gave it a poor score why because the movie puts men in their place why if more women vote for this movie because of its actual humor value and not because it is damaging to could easily be a rated movie
a long time ago i watched this movie from the middle on cable i then had a crush on mary moronov i saw her again in eating raoul i was convinced that the hottest woman on maybe biased about this movie out of the only movie i own on original tape
typically kids films have some annoying quality to it that makes it way too sappy and unbearable for someone over but then again before holes hit the scene sure it has the very same moments that often times give a kids movie its aforementioned quality but this film does a good job of staying away from such conventions the acting was decent and the uneasy dynamics that stanley had with some of the other campers was more realistic than what most movies seek to portray what i especially liked about this movie was the fact that this film didn't try to break your heart or make you cry the emotional power was a little more natural than most would imagine kind of like the shawshank redemption in many ways holes also has a similar redemptive ending to it the only down side the hokey looking lizards overall however an
this is just as good as the original if not better of course cruella steals the show with her outrageous behaviour and outfits and the movie was probably made because the public wanted to see more of cruella we see a lot more of her this time round i also like ioan gruffudd as kevin the rather bumbling male lead to use paris as the climax of the movie was a clever idea the movie is well worth watching whatever your age provided you like animals
i had heard this movie was good from a lot of my friends that saw it and they all said it was amazing so i had very high and nancy drew exceeded those high expectations it had funny parts it kept me entertained with the action and all the dudes trying to kill her and emma roberts was amazing as nancy drew the rest of the cast was very good also i would definitely recommend this movie i wonder why those guys were trying to kill us corky yeah i was wondering that too actually kinda creeping me i hate when people try to kill me so drew
the emotional impact of this movie defies words it is elegant subtle beautiful and tragic all rolled into two hours this is will smith as he matures into his acting ability the full range of it who knew i saw the pursuit of happiness and thought this must be a fluke for the blockbuster over-the-top actor smith his performances in both movies portray a whole other dimension to smith a refinement of talent the selectivity of scripts i'm not sure but i view him differently now seven pounds is one of those movies that in order to fully enjoy its essence you have to suspend your belief don't watch it for the plot watch it for the fragile condition of the human heart both literally and metaphorically it is a story of human guilt atonement love and sacrifice
victor performance is one of the finest in film think we can all feel for gypo because we've all struggled with what is right and what isn't and been wrong this was one of the first art-house pictures to be released by a major american movie studio radio h cinematography is at its very best here however stunning portion was mostly overlooked he didn't receive the oscar nomination he rightly is a psychological drama with thought philosophy sadness all conveyed with as little words as possible
this is a very intriguing short movie by david lynch and saying the name david lynch is probably enough for a lot of people this is your typical lynch short a blonde and a brunette are in a dark room the blonde has been crying the brunette is talking in a threatening way to the blonde and about a lot of silent moments but with the haunting music from angelo badalamenti there is a strange form of suspense this short feels a little like mulholland dr a movie i loved and therefore i liked this one as well it is probably especially for lynch fans but there is a chance you like this
if you know the story of grey owl you'll love the movie annie galipeau is a great actress and pierce is better than never in grey owl but in this movie no real scene of action i think this movie should be nominated at the oscars welll go see this movie a classic
if you want a serious laugh pain watch this movie and the things bruce inflicts on his fellow newscaster the deleted scenes are priceless i don't know why they didn't include them in the original movie it can't be because of time since the movie is only minutes long morgan freeman is a brilliant actor who has been overlooked for too long jim carrey needs meds
i went to the cinema with two of my friends and picked this movie out of hat totally not knowing what to expect and it turn out into a very enjoyable die-laughing experience an excellent movie with very unexpected story very good dialogs and crazy humor all characters are obviously made in alan ford satiric comic style but that haven't bothered me for a second in fact this kind of loser-bums line-up made a movie quite unique and interesting sam rockwell gave very good and convincing role willian macy too clooney is hardly recognizable and brilliant but real star is actually guzman he made a role of his life in this movie the scene when his character cosimo dies in the movie is so hilarious that it made me choke and almost die with him highly recommended for all alan ford fans
i'm really surprised this movie didn't get a higher rating on imdb one of those movies that could easily get by someone but for romantic comedy moonstruck is really in a class by itself setting and ethnic charm are things people seem to take for granted the casting alone makes it a nearly perfect movie few movies in the were as good as funny too out of
not a movie for everyone but this movie is in my top i am a lover of black comedy with a cast including richard dreyfus jeff goldblum larry bishop and gabriel byrne brass balls london in the leads the lines can't help but be dry the supporting cast is nearly dead center counting the minor flaws in the movie ellen make-up gave her face has a washed out look there were a couple of gimme cameos by joey bishop and richard pryor that served no purpose and michael j screen time was too short over all the cast was just incredible without egos to wreck a fine script if you have seen larry director film underworld dark crime flick you will enjoy this one his next outing director actor is hell ride with michael madsen and quentin tarantino
when i saw the dentist i thought it was very cool but this movie is not for everyone especially people who do not like gory scenes as the dentist has lots of gory scenes why it has rating about a beverly hills dentist dr alan feinstone who finds his wife brooke cheating on him with the poolman best to go to your dentist before you watch this but if you don't like going to the dentist already then best not to watch this as you may be put off going for life the dentist has the best bloody revenge in it that i've ever seen who has ever seen a movie that has a dentist pull out all his cheating teeth and cut out her tongue with no anesthetic overall awesome flick but not for everyone
why didn't dynamo have any pants where did they go it was never explained why this movie was so awesome plus starsky gave his kids the aids great acting too richard dawson deserved to win best supporting actor a i d s my favorite line from the movie was that hit the spot a i d s this movie was for the birds i tried to give this movie the stinkeye but it continued playing what am i doing wrong i thought the hateboat was funnnny lol i would like that for a show why wasn't dynamo wearing pants i know his arm was skewered but up with those crazy futur nets why didn't that family feud guy ray combs get a net he could have used one aidsssss
well yet again a film that plays with your sentiments and you come out all soft as opposed to a rocky film but i'm a sucker for those so i gave it a good score the acting was very good and there were a lot of feeling the violence is kept to a minimal which makes a change i'd have given it a if it were not for the salute at the end all in all a good movie with very good
my brother and i have pokemon on dvd we watched it like a couple of times and it was the best too bad it a new pokemon didn't talk this time i'll get used to iron masked marauder was pretty mean when he captured celebi with his dark ball good thing ash and sam managed to snap him out of his was only one song in the ending credits called cele-b-r-a-t-e performed by russell became a success since the three previous films and people will always love that film
after you see vertigo then watch bell book and candle made within months of each second favorite kim novak film with picnic coming in as three performances are great vertigo being the best of came to my nowhere kansas prairie town near by at salina kansas in the to film picnic book and musical score i believe is one of alex perfect for this bit of vertigo stewart and novak did this comedy how amusing to note the dramatic your time if you like kim novak the greta garbo of my youth
if you think weird al yankovic is hilarious you won't be disappointed by the compleat al not only does this rare mockumentary feature many of more memorable videos a surgeon and i love rocky road among them but they are inter-spliced with funny vignettes supposedly highlighting the rise to fame yankovic is not for all tastes but his humor is harmless and imaginative enough that even non-fans will at least be lightly amused die-hard fans will love it not only for its content but also for its relatively early look into now nearly three decade career suitable for all ages kiddies will no doubt love the funny visuals
this movie is so great its set back in probably the and meg character struggles to be known as smart plus tim robbins is so cute in this movie and everything about it has a magical feeling towards it everytime i watch it i feel happy definitely a girl movie and i'm a girl so i like it i also love the music the violin is awesome but besides that i think a cute story and everyone should watch it
i really loved it although while reading the reviews it was quite disturbing to as an anime art fan i can totally understand this perfect art work even though some of it was against my cultures and the world of art the beginning of the film is very and hard to understand the contents which make me respect the one who made someone who is extremely opened can do such daring absolutely not for though the characters are cute and adorable but they go through some disturbing adventures that cannot be if the spelling is ones memory
this is a gem of a movie not just for people who like fun and quirky premises but who love the history and traditions of sci-fi and classic hollywood movies each alien of the martian crew is the embodiment of a classic sci-fi character or member of hollywood royalty and pure pleasure watching them bounce of each other and the residents of big bean
i think a great movie because you get to see how life at home is she got so much aggression and she wants to prove that girls can fight too i think she and adrian were great actors because of this movie i am boxing too it really impressed me the only negative part i think is the end because alright between diana and adrian but you don't get to see how it is at home and i didn't really like it that you also don't get to see how her father is doing and her brother but i think it was a great movie and i think i'm going to watch it a lot more i recommend it to anyone even when you don't like boxing you get to see a lot more than only boxing i had a great time watching it
i wish that show would come back on television it was the greatest show ever they should make episodes between the other episodes but of course that would be confusing but i wish it would come back and make more episodes please come back the show was absolutely hilarious you couldn't laugh without seeing an episode there is a really funny part in every episode and plus the show was so much better when hyde and jackie were going out with each other those were the best episodes that show is the best it will be and always will be the best show ever it was really sad when the show ended they should make new episodes
lost carnivale desperate list goes on and on these and a bunch of other high-quality shows proves that we're in the middle of a golden age in television history lost is pure genius incredible layers of personal and psychologically viable stories underscored by sublime cinematography to use this word when describing a tv-show a killer score great performances and editing anyone who isn't hooked on this are missing one of the most important creative expressions in television ever it may have its problems when watching only one episode a week but the dvd format is actually an incredible way to watch this hope they keep it up i'm sure they do
this isn't the comedic robin williams nor is it the robin williams of recent thriller fame this is a hybrid of the classic drama without over-dramatization mixed with new love of the thriller but this isn't a thriller per se this is more a vehicle through which williams attempts to locate a sick boy and his starring sandra oh and rory culkin this suspense drama plays pretty much like a news report until character gets close to achieving his must say that i was highly entertained though this movie fails to teach guide inspect or amuse it felt more like i was watching a guy as he was actually performing the actions from a third person perspective in other words it felt real and i was able to subscribe to the premise of the in all worth a watch though definitely not night rates a fiend
if you like sci-fi monsters and ancient legends then you will love this movie special effects are by far the best i have seen since juarassic park hit the big screen years ago while the acting may have been a little less than desirable the story line and effects adequately compensated for wish now i had seen this at the movies on a theater screen instead of our inch big screen you like non-stop action awesome visuals and taste for myth and have to see this movie
robert taylor as the mad buffalo hunter charlie gilson is the main character in this film at the beginning i was thinking that charlie would end up redeeming himself like john wayne in the searchers or james stewart in the naked spur but as the film goes along gilson keeps doing more atrocities until you realize there is no hope for him stewart granger is sandy mckenzie who wants to stop hunting because he realizes that the buffaloes will soon be gone and he becomes disgusted by the act of killing gilson is a natural killer who makes no distinction between animals or human beings debra paget as the indian girl is a surprising character considering the self imposed censorship of that time she lies with gilson in total resignation even though she hates him the last scene of a frozen gilson is unforgettable
this is a small film few characters yet it says something about ireland that you won't find film is ireland in all grubiness boys master doyle sp o'donell the cannon senator daughter gar and above all know in the pub with them or kneeling to pray with them they are our sad history and they are our present
i was taken to this film by a friend and was sceptical about a swedish film with subtitles however i thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this beautiful film the unnecessary cruelty that man is capable of was portrayed confidently without overwhelming images although animal lovers may have to shield their eyes for a brief couple of seconds somewhere during the first minutes a traditional story of humility versus brutality and hope versus tragedy was illustrated from a satisfyingly fresh angle using a spectrum of characters with very natural flaws and features i particularly liked how the film managed to address multiple aspects of hypocritical human behaviour that concern bias discrimination and sanctimonious pretence an absolute gem of a film that i will promote to all who will listen
i'm on the opposite end of the previous of all i don't think this was intended to be a straight sequel to the jerk i mean not titled the jerk the jerk too which leads me to believe that while a lot of the character names are the same it actually revolves around a completely different about it virtually no connection to the previous movie other than character names a totally different story different cast and the fact that a partial say give this movie some credit it does have plenty of laughs in it mark blankfield at his prime
this is a bizzare look at life back when he still a hyper the home videos of al as a kid are great and the commentary from his life parents gives a nice glimpse of just how weird al wound up as screwed up as he is this video is a must own for any devoted al-coholic
the movie itself made me want to go and call someone so they could enjoy it too it was extremely funny angelena jolie was wonderful as juliet the parents are are caterers as well as kids play the parts of romeo and juliet in the church fall in love and their parents try to keep them ahead i think they sneak off after a party and do it surprisingly they still want to get married in the end of the movie if you don't like stereotypes and the defilement of classic literature don't watch if you don't mind those you will have a blast watching this one
it is an excellent thriller from turkey which can make job from gokbakar of want to point on screen screen play in most films from turkey is not gen has the best shots to be said also transition parts are really the other has a great topic that influence woman who wants to be a psyciatrist in a sanitarium has a mother that is a habitual causes and psychological consequences are given in only thing you have to do is to combine all the is an impressive aggression part doga rutkay and sahan gokbakar performance may be more realistic than bellucci last thing i want to say is watch this get confused
strange enough all the previous comments merely described the beginning and left the details over i feel a necessity to confirm that this is a family work since marina vlady was also robert wife and the excellent jazz music was written by te father andré under these circumstances no wonder it was a really good thriller seen when issued and immediately identified with the music the suspense was flawless and maintained throughout until the end robert hossein at the time one of the best european players managed to impose himself also as a top screen and stage director still putting up great stage shows with a preference for religious carasso paris france
against all flags is every bit the classic swashbuckler it has all the elements the adventure fan could hope for and more for in this one the damsel in distress is well not really in distress as spitfire stevens maureen o'hara is at her athletic best running her foes through in defiance of the social norms of the period anthony quinn rounds out the top three billed actors as the ruthless captain roc brasiliano and proves to be a wily and capable nemesis for brian hawke for the classic adventure fan against all flags is a must-see while it may not be in quite the same league as some of errol earlier work blood and the sea hawk for instance it is still a greatly entertaining romp
this is a great movie but there could be more about soylent green there should be more scenes of what they do to people how people act in i think it would be neat to see if all this does happen in the year and beyond even if you still know what the secret is it is a great movie so go rent or buy this movie right now
it has been so many years since i saw this but i do feel compelled to defend this gem against those who lambast is interesting and unusual to observe the diversity of opinion here that is what humour does i suppose it is subjective it either charges through your funny bone at volts or it leaves you cold and wondering why you gave it the show has some of best comic actors put together in a story that is silly and irreverent and the outcome is hilarious the dialogue and visual comedy is beautifully delivered and the two leads and lowe are superb together this was made for can't really say anymore other than to implore you to find this and watch it you won't be disappointed and in a world devoid of genteel humour this is a classic inane and harmless piece of comedic brilliance
i teach japanese for an online high school and i include cultural activities so that the students can learn about the country as well as the language and watching gung ho is one of the requirements the students can either buy or rent the movie stereotypes or not this helps the students to see that other people view the world and their lives differently than we do many of my students have told me that they enjoyed the movie so much they are going to get a copy for themselves it is really interesting to see what we value in this culture and what they value in their culture i just wish i could get a cleaned-up tv version i'm not really into the crude language the auto workers use all the time
one of my best films ever maybe because i was well into the punk scene in the late and went to many of hazels concerts but the film was a good story line and very good acting by hazel and a up and coming phil daniels not sure about his latest project eastenders excellent performance by lots of unknown actors who if you keep your eyes peeled will see them in many of the uk soaps today exp carver out of the bill the more i watch it the more of them i spot well if you have not seen it yet have a night in with the video don't forget to dig out the safety pin for your nose and heavy black eye makeup and shave your head mochanian
i've been a fan of xu ke tsui for many year since school this film is the best fantasy movie in years i dont think action is the right genre though there're lot of action and kongfu scenese wait did i mentioned this is an oriental fantasy moive please keep in mind that do not use hollywood formula to rate this film and for the guy who poo around i don't blame you cause you still young and need to know more about culture
who would have thought that such an obscure little film could be so haunting and touching i am really impressed a shame that more people have not seen it i loved as always hans score and what a directorial debut by bernard rose yet i wonder if i should call this a horror film it could easily be argued that it is a fantasy or a drama as well well regardless i love the interpretive potential it has everything and everyone in by charlotte represents a real conflict in her house itself the tree mark the lighthouse etc it is the many details such as these that make the film so good for repeated viewings i hope i come across another little movie as loaded with emotion and psychological meaning as this one some time soon
i had never heard of this film before a couple of weeks ago but its concept interested me when i heard it an american man meets a european woman on his last night in europe and they spend the night together talking it sparked my interest but i never expected it to be this great before sunrise is a masterpiece and also one of the most romantic films on record to my surprise it completely lacked the cynicism of the impossible to really talk too much about it since there is no real plot so to speak there are plenty of thoroughly interesting things you could talk about it is sort of like my dinner with andre where there is a conversation but not just the conversation that matters but let me just say see it see it
this is one of those movies like dave american dreamer and local hero that holds a interest time and again lightweight movies seldom win oscars but whoever did the casting for soapdish deserves one even after one has seen the movie and knows what is coming still enjoyable to watch how the various plot facets develop true all the drama is melodrama but entirely fitting for a movie with a soap opera background my favorite line comes from whoopi goldberg now why can't i write like that i think unfortunate that the tv and website censors insist on all this unnecessary sanitation
a beautiful film touching profoundly up the simple yet divine aspects of humanity movie was almost perfect and seeing as nothing in this world can be truly perfect that is pretty good the only minor thing i subjectively object to is the pacing at some points in the middle of the story the acting is also very good and all the actors easily top actors in high-profile films the actual directing seems to have been well thought through and the script must have been amazing there are some truly breathtaking moments of foreshadowing and a quite gorgeous continuing circular composition of the moment in the movie when the main character achieves that feeling of being in heaven is the perfect ending to a truly brilliant yarn
i'm not tired to say this is one of the best political thrillers ever made the story takes place in a fictional state but obviously it deals with the murder of kennedy a truthful and honest district attorney by yves montand does not believe that the murder was planned and executed by the single man daslow and though all other officials want to close the case he continuous to investigate with his screenplay is written tight and fast and holds the tension till the end just the part dealing with the milgram experiment about authorities is not uninteresting a bit out of place the ending sequence explaining who icarus really is partly shot in slow motion and intensified by a morricone soundtrack is the most powerful sequence i have ever seen in a movie
hi for all the people who have seen this wonderful movie im sure thet you would have liked it as much as i i love the songs once you have seen the show you can sing along as though you are part of the show singing and dancing dancing and singing the song one is an all time fave musical song too and the strutters at the end with the mirror its so oh you have to watch this one
this is sad this movie is the tops this should at least be in the top movies here this is still the best action movie ever done the action movies of today are badly done the actors and action directors do not no how to do it fighting and stunts properly only some no how to do it mostly from hong kong like jackie chan the stunts are so clever and wild i do not think we will see the likes of ever the start where chan and his team go down the hill car chase through the hill town is just amazing the end fight stunts are for me the best fight stunts ever put to film the end stunt sliding down the pole crashing through the glass jackie was badly hurt
this is a really cool movie i remember first seeing it when i was really young and i used to watch it all the time like once a was my favorite character in the movie homeward bound is really funny and its really cool how they train the animals to do all those things parts of the movie are sad though as when sassy the cat falls down the waterfall and when shadow falls in the hole at the end i have seen the second homeward bound but i gotta say its not as good as the first shadow is the smart one sassy is well sassy and chance is the funny idiot i recommend this movie to anyone who likes comedies or talking animals this is one of my top ten favorite movies
rohmer returns to his historical dramas in the real story of grace elliot an englishwoman who stayed in france during the apex of the french revolution one always suspected that rohmer was a conservative but who knew he was such a red-blooded reactionary if you can put aside unabashed defense of the monarchy that is not an easy thing to do given that for instance the french lower classes are portrayed here as hideous louts this is actually an elegant intelligent and polished movie lacking the money for a big cinematic recreation of century france rohmer has instead the actors play against obvious painted cardboards it is a blatantly artificial conceit but it somehow works and newcomer lucy russell succeeds in making sympathetic a character that shouldn't be
you like to solve mysteries you like complex narrations this is for you brilliant clever movie by francis of a legendary french canadian signer felix leclerc flashy photo and clever editing is the word of leclerc strongly helped by roy dupuis dythirambic in the lead plot is about alexandre tourneur veterinary in his who just woke up from a coma after being unplugged by somebody unknown tourneur is struggling to remember who hit him as he was ending a sufferings on the road throughout the struggling he has weird behavior and it seems like something took over spooky but very mysterious and well played movie i have my hypothesis on the think the indian caused the accident but this ending was open to any strongly recommend it
such a shame that because of title this film will be avoided by people who hate football bend it like beckham is much more than a cheesy sports flick the story line is touching and intelligent without being soppy the jokes were laugh out loud funny and the characters are well acted parminder nagra and keira knightley are brilliant as teenagers jess and jules putting in great performances both on and off the pitch anupam kher is wonderful as jess worried father and jonathan rhys-meyers who was so amazingly evil in ride with the devil comes across so well as the nice guy for once making full use of his gorgeous irish accent even if you don't like football go see this film if anything it'll make you smile
in world of digital fabrication there is no computer than can replace the actor and writer alas this type of character driven film is far too rare these days performance as well as james earl jones are faithful to their high expectations i wonder if this movie was made for tv it has a close-up personal quality to the narrative it is an understatement to say that the performances are all outstanding the only thing that keeps it from being a cinema masterpiece is the lack of a great cinematographer but pretty pictures are not everything how can talent the likes of jones and duvall continue to produce such fine work in an age where actors pose for the digitizing
i'm really getting in the midst of watching this year old wonder what my grandchildren will be watching years from an old they don't make em like that not only the the acting both by young and cast it would born to play their many to mention them role played by the judge oliver stands seen in other roles over the artful moody as and mrs movie not only won took a few golden globe awards you decide to see this yourself a a few if not all the see this masterpiece
many people have commented that this movie was nowhere near as good as the first well maybe it isn't to you however how does your child react to it well mine loved it more than the movies of the past can sometimes be a little harsh for little kids example mother getting shot this movie was really great for my sensitive little girl who likes humor and happy you want to be snobby about what should be standards based on the past skip this movie you have a sweet little girl or soft-hearted little boy you really want to please buy this movie and treat your small children this film is great as a bedtime movie for happy dreams instead of nightmares i'm happy with a movie that pleases my kid doesn't need to impress the parents all the time
the version i saw of this film was the blockbuster rental with a similar title but a swear word in film was funny as hell it was also true to the bone if you have ever spent time in hollywood or the area around it you will understand the humor if not you may not get it at story of two people in the business struggling to make it until they finally reach a breaking point it is a rare gem it states it is a drama but it is a drama as much as deer hunter is a dean is wonderful as always as a supporting actor jamie kennedy was able to hold his own well his performance is especically impressive during the poodle scene the only downside was carmen electra but we can't have everything
of all the versions of the odyssey of any greek mythological story for that matter this in my opinion is the best of them all almost true to the original storyline with some minor deviations and omissions the absence of scylla charybdis and the fact that eumaeus the swineherd recognizes odysseus in disguise in his hut realistic acting and authentic scenery and costumes all contribute to make this a truly memorable some hollywoodish sword-and-sandal b-flick notwithstanding the fact that the dialogue and subtitles are completely in italian if one is familiar with the storyline he can still make heads and tails of what is going on and what the actors are saying you have a good handy text of the odyssey at hand at least i did and so much so that it has inspired me to study the italian language to better appreciate the movie even more
i think this movie is well done and realistic i you are used to watching hollywood action movies and use that as a standard to rate this movie you are bound to be disappointed this movie is much closer to real life than of what hollywood can produce and that is what lifts it above the average action movie i have no experience with swedish military whatsoever and can therefore not point out any mistakes in the way they act but as i have seen the making of extra i'm convinced that there has been done a lot to avoid any mistakes this is a movie i will recommend for others to watch high quality realistic story and movie
i was at the same screenwriters conference and saw the movie i thought the writer sue smith very clearly summarised what the film was about however the movie really didn't need explanation i thought the themes were abundantly clear and inspiring a movie which deals with the the ability to dare to face fear especially fear passed down from parental figures and overcome it and in doing so embrace possibilities is a film to be treasured and savoured i enjoyed it much more than the much-hyped somersault i also think was a bit unkind to hugo weaving as a bloke about his vintage i should look so good i agree that many australian films have been lacklustre recently but peaches delivers the goods i'm glad i saw it
idiotic hack crooks a babe a safe a plan and a baby add them all up and you get the best comedy you've never heard of with some a-list star power least b-plus this movie got very little that does not diminish its writing solid delivery and a believable group of characters some truly classic lines and a fun twist at the is not some watered-down nutty professor comedy these are low-life bad guys they speak low-life bad guy language and they do low-life bad guy things but they do it for your amusement and entertainment and they do that of the best comedies i've ever seen
kurt chameleon-like performance coupled with john flawless filmmaking makes this one without a doubt one of the finest boob-tube bios ever aired it holds up too the emotional foundation is strong enough that it'll never age carpenter has preserved for posterity the power and ultimate poignancy of the life of the one and only king of rock and roll been a borderline elvis fan most of my life but it wasn't until i saw this mind-blowingly moving movie that i looked beyond the image at the man himself it was quite a revelation elvis remains one of the top ten made-for-tv movies of all time
diego armando maradona was and still remains as the best football player the game has offered not just an athlete but an artist this documetary if the world cup will forever live in the memories of every football fan around the world because of his tremendous and unbelievable goal which he scored against my own absolutely no point of diminishing this star although i dont undersand spanish i can appreciate the argentine narrator he actually cries of happiness and can barely express his emotion anything i wrote can be senseless and difficult to comprehend but have to watch this to know what i mean
anyone who has experienced the terrors of divorce will empathize with this indie protagonist a scared little boy who believes a zombie is hiding in his closet is jake mesmerizing anthony demarco simply transferring the trauma of two bickering parents to an understandable image or could the creature be real shelli ryan neatly balances both possibilities and keeps the audience guessing her choice of using one setting a suburban house adds to the feeling of desperation and bloom and peter sean bridgers are highly convincing as the angry but loving parents however it is the creepy minor characters mrs gruen an unhinged babysitter and sam stone bode a sleazy real estate agent that linger in the mind closet is a darkly inspired portrait of childhood as a special kind of hell
the danes character finally buddy have the awful truth leave me alone kiss men if you want to she screams self-righteously in front of everyone thus destroying the man who has been in love with her for so long nice girl this might be the place to reconsider all of the giggly charm that danes pours into this character great reason to feel sympathy for her lying in bed and dying but hey remember there are no mistakes except maybe seeing this film a minute this irony is intended this is actually a masterpiece of ironic wit yes but somehow i doubt what the creators of this film had in mind sadly maybe there are a few mistakes after all
but watch mary performance closely her body language her fine body movements her subtle but powerfully effective reactions this is an accomplished artist at the top of her craft and the rest of the cast were pretty damned good too is perhaps the or viewing for me and i see more in it each time what this world coming to anyway
old people show i'm and have been watching the show since i was recoding it onto my box everyday from hallmark and bbc i really wish they hadn't cancelled it they didn't even get a proper farewell but what an adventure all those episodes i think i've seen them all and not one comes to mind that i didn't like and a shame the bbc keep swapping between diagnoses murder and murder she never watched it and don't intend to anyways he characters in diagnoses murder are so in-depth and the chemistry between the actors is amazing it really was a sad day when they cancelled this show
all the a stage and its people actors in something like that who the hell said that theatre stopped at the orchestra even at the theatre door why is not the audience participants in the theatrical experience including the story film was a grand experiment that said hey the story is you and it needs more than your attention it needs your active participation sometimes we bring the story to you sometimes you have to go to the no one listened but that does not mean it should not have been said
there are few really hilarious films about science fiction but this one will knock your sox off the lead jack nicholson take-off is side-splitting the plot has a very clever twist that has be seen to be enjoyed this is a movie with heart and excellent acting by all make some popcorn and have a great evening
as anyone old enough knows south africa long suffered under the vile racist oppression of apartheid which completely subjugated the black population one of the most famous anti-apartheid activists was steve biko who was murdered in jail following the murder reporter donald woods sought to get message out to the cry freedom woods kline befriends biko washington before the latter is arrested on trumped up charges when woods attempts to spread word he and his family begin living under threat of attack and they are finally forced to flee the country the last scene gut-wrenchingly shows police firing on one of two movies with a world apart that helped galvanize the anti-apartheid movement cry freedom stands out as possibly the best ever work for all involved
before i watched this tv movie i did not know much about one of my favorite actresses after watching it i realized how sad lucille life really was it had great moments too but i didn't realize how sad it was this movie was very good and told the story of the beloved lucille ball very well i highly reccommend it
rock n roll high school was one of the best movies ever made i think the only reason it was so awesome was because of the ramones you couldn't have made the same movie and put something like the sex pistols or the clash in place of the ramones it just wouldn't have been the same dey young clint howard vincent van patten mary woronov paul bartel and the hall monters just added to the movie the whole entire movie is about the joey so everybody showed see rock n roll high school if your a huge fan of real punk not the sissy new the loud and fast kind the kind only the ramones could do in peace joey ramone dee dee ramone
elephant walk starring an early peter finch as lord of the manor in some god-forsaken plantation where there is always the danger of elephants or mad englishmen staying out in the midday sun and going berserk well eventually they do after the typhoid or cholera outbreak of course and much mayhem ensues taylor replaced an ailing vivien leigh in this pot flick when the elephants storm the house and trap liz on the grand staircase i still get goose bumps thank goodness dana andrews is around to save the day one of my favorite guilty pleasures in color too
valliant effort to use a mining catastrophe as a vehicle to pronounce this distaste for war the audience not only learns a great deal about early mining rescue procedures but we learn that europeans at the interval between wwi and wwii had concerning lack of a better term the speeches given by both representatives of each country at the end of the film are inspiring given the time although the revised edition through the transfer technology of early foreign films cuts-off characters heads at times this film holds own in many different aspects character analysis lighting techniques historical content and a scenario that has tested and inspired many a writer and went on to direct and put to screen weil three penny opera starring the original star lotte lenya
well i do disagreed with the other comment posted piedras is much much better them magnolia or any of the other films that were about non real characters i think that someone just wrote that only because he never lived in the spanish society like i did i'm not spanish is a very real film with real characters very well done by one of the best spanish actress antonia san be a european film in contrast with an american film well we different societies personally i dislike american modern films a lot like the classics and some of the andy american films but they are very a film about the continuous constitution of a person liked or not we all make mistakes but some can learn about the mistakes
the memory of the the last hunt has stuck with me since i saw it in when i was it is a movie that was far ahead of others at the time in that it addressed the treatment of the natives the environment and the ever present contrast between the short and long term effects of greed it is as relevant today as in a cinemagraphic discussion of utmost depth and relevance to top it off the setting is beautiful and the cinematography excellent the memory of this movie will be with me to the end of my days
this was by far the best war documentary ever made from the very beginning of the first episode when sir laurence olivier described the horrific events in oradour-sur-glane the day the soldiers came to the final days of the war when the mushroom clouds appeared over japan i never missed a second of this classic series and i remember it well even though it was screened way back in each and every aspect of this tragedy was covered in detail this whole series should be compulsory viewing for as many of the children as possible so that the tragedy of world war two is not repeated and that bigotry hatred greed and intolerance are not confused with patriotism or religious zeal
this movie is was enchanted i should say and surprised because of how uniquely it was done the cast the sequencing the magnificent i mean it was a love story yes but what made it outstanding from the rest was that it was told in an entertaining wholesome me it is the representation of modern fairy tale like the modern peter surely would buy a copy of this the moment it hit the movie is really a double must see one stars for that
highly well written funny film which will appeal to everyone out there with a sense of humour give it a go good to see an independent british movie more than holding own against the big established studios definitely worth adding to any film collection there are scenes in this film that i'm sure a lot of people will be able to relate to you will laugh out loud at the antics and enjoy the great soundtrack i especially enjoyed the version of jimmy vietnam and the tower of take on freebird on give it a go you won't be disappointed
i just saw this recently after an interval of nearly forty years it holds up well especially lionel outstanding songs will buy with magical counterpoint just one of many disagree with the other post that decried its g rating the ratings system brand new at the time never intended the g rating to mean completely devoid of it as unsuitable for kids reminds me of the description i once saw of the wizard of oz a girl arrives in a strange land and kills the first person she encounters she then goes on a road trip with three male companions and kills again
this is one of the first and best columbos starring robert culp and ray milland robert culp appeared on another columbo as did several other villains including patrick mcgoohan william shatner and jack cassidy ray milland also made a later this one ray milland is convinced his beautiful wife played by patricia crowley is having an affair so he hires culp to investigate culp has a blackmailing business on the side so he gives milland a fake report and threatens crowley with the real one if she doesn't pay up they get into a huge fight in home and she winds up murdered enter does everything he can to get columbo off the case including offering him a job but columbo is on to him from the episode
this movie is far better than the original the jerk i would highly recommend it to anyone who like quirky humor we have incorporated almost as many lines from this movie into our daytime discourse as we have from monty card game with the hobos and then with mr suicide the scene at the dinner table and his distaste for turtle soup the original the jerk was too choreographed ans staged while i like steve martin he seemed like he was trying to hard the jerk too is a spoof and will be enjoyed by anyone the jerk too is family friendly unlike the original the jerk
bela lugosi appeared in several of these low budget chillers for monogram studios in the and the corpse vanishes is one of the better plays a mad scientist who kidnaps young brides and kills them and then extracts fluid from their bodies so he can keep his ageing wife looking young after a reporter and a doctor stay the night at his home and discover he is responsible for the brides deaths the following morning they report these murders to the police and the mad scientist is shot and drops dead shortly have got almost everything in this movie the assistants consist of an old hag a hunchback and dwarf sons a thunderstorm and spooky passages in house bela and his wife find they sleep better in coffins rather than beds in the corpse vanishes is worth a look especially for bela lugosi fans great stars out of
dig is funny fun amusing interesting stylish and very well done knowing that it was made on such a shoestring budget over years it is amazing that such a story can be told especially with such style and substance if you are a music fan or documentary fan this is a must on the brian jonestown masssacre and the dandy warhols over the years is a brilliant way to show the contrast between a decent band who meets with moderate success through perseverance and the ability to compromise and a genius megalomaniacal lead singer backed up by a varied cast of characters who sabotage their own success through drugs alcohol and insanity if i did not know that this is footage of real people i would swear it was an incredibly well written and imaginative scripted piece the story is compelling concise and simply amazing
fay the sister of the notorious nobel prize-winning smut poet simon grim still loves henry fool their son receives an ingenious orgy-in-a-box from an undisclosed sender and a chase across three continents ensues involving a supremely sad-sack collection of government agents terrorists flight attendants and posey delivers a perfectly timed comic performance including some brilliant physical work with strong contributions by jasmin tabatabai and saffron burrows fay grim proves in the best billy wilder tradition that nothing is funnier than a beautiful woman in good score by hartley thanks in the credits to the american academy in berlin where hartley served as a fellow in fall
another comment about this film made it sound lousy given talking pictures were so new i think the script and acting were good davis was so young and fresh she had not yet found her own style that we had grown to expect yet it is great to see her this way still learning the many clichés came from this film and it seems this film blazed some trails for the next years my vote is see it and remember how young this type of film was keep and open mind and you maybe shocked at how troubled the characters were in this picture for being and how we view the early part of last century as uptight i love it and hope you make up your own mind about it not influenced by others negative and one note comments
kudos to fawcett to taking on roles that at the time were considered controversial to my recollection rape was still a taboo subject in the and rights and emotions were rarely so deeply examined during that is simply a woman who is followed then stalked by actor james russo he is adequate as the obsessed psychopath but at times a bit scarwid has a bit role as does alfre woodard as the house mate woodard worries about the legal consequences when fawcett the rape victim takes revenge on the culprit the scene where she throws a frying pan of hot oil at russo is classic and as the rapist he deserves it she then keeps him in bondage and the consequences must be very real story reflecting the emotions and rage of rape victims who have been violated physically and mentally highly recommended
i love paul mccartney he is in my oppinion the greatest of all time i could not however afford a ticket to his concert at the tacoma dome during the back in the tour i was upset to say the least then i found this dvd it was almost as good as being there paul is still the man and i will enjoy this for years to come do have one complaint i would of like to hear all of hey paul is not single greatest concert dvd out of
an excellent series masterfully acted and directed but unloved am told by mr deighton and withdrawn by him after a single presentation it is now only viewable in private collections and via the british film institute at special request very unfortunate as ian nuanced portrayal of the weary-but-determined bernard samson is superb one of his very best performances the supporting cast including the young amanda donohoe and hugh fraser are superb with mel martin playing the conflicted and traitorous wife and michael degen as the mercurial werner the story positively simmers with the tragic and fateful personal consequences of the great game
i can agree with other comments that there wasn't an enormous amount of history discussed in the movie but it wasn't a documentary it was meant to entertain and i think it did a very good job at agree with the black family the scenes with them seemed out of place like all of a sudden it would be thrown in but i did catch on to the story and the connection between the families later on and found it pretty it wasn't a re-enactment of the it did bring into the light very big and important landmark periods of the decade i found it very entertaining and worth my while to watch
thought at first this film would be your typical western film however it turned out to be very interesting and kept me spellbound right to the very end which turned out very unusual charlton had past experiences with james and zach never forgave sam and would stop at nothing to make sure he caught up with him and paid him back unfortunately barbara portrait of a managed to get caught up in this situation and found herself among sex starved men who never seemed to leave her alone sam burgade had to make some very hard decisions and and i was quite surprised at the conclusion this is a very entertaining film and the acting was outstanding
this show will succeed because it appeals to all adults no matter where they are in their relationship as a man married for years i empathize with patrick character he loves his wife but he assumes she knows that i also enjoy his monotone delivery never gets too excited or too low a nice ensemble of characters this will be a nice addition to the monday night don't know how david spade will be in his role he is best enjoyed in small doses he also seems a little old to still be trolling for enjoyed the pilot and i look forward to seeing how the series develops
i saw this movie in the theater and was thoroughly impressed by it then again that was when claire danes was a good actress not the foolish arrogant hollywood-ized bitch she is today anyway this film really struck me as one of the more raw realistic beautiful friendship films how far would you really go for your best friend i was moved to tears at the end and still tear up when i watch it now own it i remember as soon as i left the theater i called my best friend and sobbed to her how much i loved her this is a great film to watch with your best girlfriend however be prepared for the almost certain conversation afterward where she turns to you and asks if you'd do something like that for her
this film i thought was the great journey that forrest gump should have been a rare treat to watch a cable movie in the middle of the day and come across a foreign film that is done so well this film is very well acted and i strongly suggest it to anyone who can take sub-titles
a wonderful film filled with great understated performance and sharp intelligent dialogue what really distinguishes the film however is that undercurrent of sadness throughout the story is underscored by affairs loneliness suicide disappointment the fear of losing ones job in a world where that had disastrous consequences most of all it was set in a world that no longer existed having been ripped apart by the beginning of world war ii in fact the film is barely a comedy at all if you compare the percentage of serious scenes to the comic scenes yet funny it to margaret harsh dismissal of jimmy stewart and watch his pained expression as he replies that her comments were a remarkable blend of poetry and meanness funny pointed and sad all at once a remarkable achievement and one of the ten greatest screen comedies ever made
this along with hare tonic ranks as one of the best bugs cartoons indeed one of the best bugs ever there are some comments about how bugs in these cartoons is basic meaning i guess that he is as yet not fully developed i actually prefer this basic version from the jones was the best version who is actually more rabbit-sized and far more amusing than the eventual long-legged version who towered over yosemite sam and daffy duck the latter-day bugs came to be too suave and sophisticated for my liking also check out hair raising hare and rabbit punch for great examples of classic bugs and classic chuck jones
this is the best version far that you will see and the most true to the bronte work dalton is a little tough to imagine as rochester who jane eyre declared not handsome but his acting overcomes this and zelah clark pretty as she is is also a complete and believable jane eyre this production is a lengthy watch but well worth it nearly direct quotes from the book are in the script and if you want the very first true romance in literature this is the way to see it i own every copy of this movie and have read and re-read the original the filming may seem a little dated now but there will never be another like this
i grew up with this as my all-time favorite film the special effects are incredible for the era and won awards i can remember the dialogue as if i'd heard it yesterday it is simply a great timeless adventure the music is by miklos rosza who is cinema best sabu is the thief conrad veidt is the grand villain i have a copy within reach for the next trip down memory lane whoa there rex ingram wants out of his genii bottle
a guy thing may not be a classic but it sure is a good funny comedy the plot focuses on paul lee who wakes up the morning after his bachelor party with no memory and becky stiles lying naked in his bed before he can figure out what happened he rushes becky out of his apartment because his fiance karen blair is coming after that as you could imagine chaos every single scene in a guy thing delivers loud laughs the funniest moments come from when paul imagines what could happen if he tells karen selma blair is a truly talented comedian and the worst thing about this film is that she goes underused although she turns out to be more funny than stiles character who actually isn't that interesting of course not every comedy is i said a guy thing is no classic but not bad either
i didn't expect much from this but i have to admit i was rolling on the ground laughing a few times during this film if you are not grossly offended in the first ten minutes this might be a film for you ditto if you are the type that would enjoy watching amanda peet shuffling cards for an hour and a half certainly not a momentous work of comedy but given the low-budget indy genesis this is masterful to level the playing field for comparison imagine all of the studio films with their budgets slashed by a factor of or so and see what you get kudos to peter cohen and his network for seeing this through i look forward to his next effort
amazing movie i saw this movie for the first time on a flight and could not believe that i had not even heard of it before getting on that plane while it may seem at first to be a chick flick it is a film that everyone should see and will enjoy men watch this movie with someone you love you will enjoy it as much as she does and it will score you big points
this movie is one of my favorites because it makes me think of all the choices i have made and how my life would change if my choices had been different it plays right into the multiple universe only thing that doesn't ring true is how larry burrows james such a hard time understanding what is going on that everything has
a must see for anyone who loves photography stunning and you in ore seen it twice once in a cinema and now on dvd it holds up well on dvd but on the big screen this was something my two daughters to see this and they loved it my oldest cried at the she was the one who wanted to see it again tonight when she saw it at the video shop its simple telling of a love for nature and in particular a fox is told well in some ways it reminded me of the bear in its telling a story not documentary formate which works for children very well not being preached to is very important you make your own mind the star of this film is the cinematographers how did they do what they did amazing just amazing
this short was nominated for an academy award and i wish it had won basically a filmed jam session between some very talented musicians including lester young and joe jones the music is incredible hollywood quite often embraced jazz animation believe it or not but this is a rare look on film at an improvisational jam this has been added to the film preservation list and deservedly so tcm runs this as filler periodically and runs it every march sometime for its days of oscar tribute from downtown at the buzzer swish nothing but net and the so smooth the net barely moved most solidly and highly recommended
i saw this film tonight in nyc at the landmark sunshine i didn't know what to expect i'd not read much about it as i knew i would see it no matter what all in all it is very well done it doesn't focus on the generalization of anti-war statements which to me left the politics out of it the soldiers mainly spoke of their awareness of toxicity in their training in boot camp and how hard it was once they returned to civilian life it was really good to see paul rieckhoff and camilo mejia tell about the difficulty in surviving not only the war but refusing the command to go back when it was against personal morals make no mistake this is not an anti-war film anyone who says it is hasn't seen it or is not living with the scars of war on their souls
i thought this movie was the fact that corrine and sean are newcomers to the was packed with action and a little there were some points when corrine didn't speak very clearly she threatened sean with the gun and she clenched her she was supposed think the roles of joseph and sonny were portrayed very there was an obvious i watched next action am certain that corrine and sean did their own were performed very am looking forward to another movie by the they make a great perhaps a sequel to bet your life-possibly called making it big in the big could this time be about your life is excellent
from start to finish i laughed real hard throughout the whole movie amazing that the groove tube is possibly the granddaddy yet raunchiest of all comedic skit is the way i enjoy watching tv without being bored at flipping channels only to suffer from insomnia for minutes the weird strange humor never stops just think of how all this nonsense laughing can help you enjoy life easier way way better than comedy central or any prime time show do yourself a favor and trash all those soft lame romantic comedy movies into the wastebasket better yet tell your box office manager you want the groove tube back on the big screen
it takes patience to get through david eccentric for a life-affirming chronicle of alvin journey but stick with it though it moves as slow as john deere when he meets the kind strangers along his pilgrimage we learn much about the isolation of aging the painful regrets and secrets and ultimately the power of family and reconciliation richard farnsworth caps his career with the most genuine performance sad and poetic flinty and caring and sissy spacek matches him as his slow daughter rose who pines over her own private loss while caring for dad rarely has a modern film preached so positively about family
i found this film to funny from the start john waters use of characters reminded of some of the down to earth characters from fellini films christina ricci has once again expanded her abilities in this film if you are looking for a fun movie without preaching i recommend this film
the acting in this movie was superb but mixed with the truth about the condition of many africans in south africa made it heart wrenching it was good that the writer isolated boesman and lena from others run from their homes so we could share fully in their triumphs and defeats the conflicts they shared as they grew together and apart worth seeing when you put the movie in proper context
made in the same year as vertigo this is an equally bewitching movie though in a much lighter vein set in an enchanted new york during the winter kim novak is a witch who casts a spell over james stewart but gets caught in it instead the interesting sidelight is that rival is played by janice rule who originated the part of madge in picnic on broadway part that novak would make famous on film
i must say that i had wanted to see this film for a long time and i was not disappointed the acting of dominic monaghan is simply fantastic as a part insomniac myself i can relate with how the story develops i have never experienced anything of the sort but some awake moments overlap the sleeping and it can be scary it was a great film worth every penny i hope that one day i can work with tess myself it would be an honor and beyond i can recommend it for everybody maybe not small children as they may get scared but if you are an insomniac like me you'll understand the world the mysteries and the fear you'll love it
although this was obviously a low-budget production the performances and the songs in this movie are worth seeing one of few musical roles to date is a marvelous dancer and singer and he demonstrates his acrobatic skills as well watch for the cartwheel also starring jason connery a great story and very likable characters
most people miss point of concept if a hero can stimulate heroic deeds to the mind of a child within the confines of the law then i approve of the lessons being taught by doc all times of conflict or war the public and government look for heroes to decorate the motion picture industry brings heroes to the screen for people to identify with such as doc savage james bond superman batman spiderman and others doc savage is remembered by more than one generation as being the best of the best before james bond superman or any of the others all others that follow doc savage are only a part of the character not the man of bronze
watch on the rhine is one of the best anti-nazi propaganda films made during world war two paul lukas was certainly deserving of his oscar bette davis shines brilliantly as the great actress and beauty she was i would recommend this film to those interested in that era and of course the fabulous films of the late great ms bette davis
the best treasure island ever made they just don't make this anymore or ever no one makes films like this a novelty this film is funny frank and fascinating yet and morose this is one of my favorite pictures must have had some idea what it is all about but leaves room for your own impressions and interpretations while leaving little left to the imagination why not made more films like this i have no idea me of some of the best noir it is one of a kind but not for the lazy or simple
the film cross eyed by adam jones propels the viewer on a ride of redemption as the main character takes back control of the wheel and sets his life in order adam jones has found an imaginative and refreshing way to empower his character and actualize what matters most these truths become apparent to both the characters and viewers as you laugh and gag to the credits with them the simple yet attractive keep you guessing about what you will see next you can't help but smile and laugh at the antics that take place in this movie i can't wait for his sophomore effort it is only a matter of time before jones strikes again bravo
kudos to cesar montano for reviving the cebuano movie panaghoy sa suba is very good it has the drama the action the romance and scene that will make you the story is not that original love triangle or make a four-cornered-love japanese occupation rebellion american as lord its presentation is something cool especially it uses it original language bisaya for the filipino nipongo for the japanese and english for the movie will go as one of this best pinoy watch this
i have seen a lot of saura films and always found amazing the way he assembles music dance drama and great cinema in his movies ibéria shows an even better saura dealing with multimedia concepts and a more contemporary concept of dance and music another thing that called my attention is the fact that in this movie dancers and musicians dance and music are equally important the camera shows various aspects of music interpretation examining not only technical issues but also the emotional experience of playing the interest of saura on the bridge between classical and contemporary music and dance is one more ingredient in turning this movie maybe the most aesthetically exciting among his other works why i recommend it strongly to those who love good cinema good music good dance great art
what is really sad shows like six and brothers sisters are the true reality tv not that garbage that are nothing more than glorified game shows i think the ground swell of discontent has been there for the past few years with very premature of numerous shows with a cult following but with the more vocal backlash the fans of jericho i also enjoy and other shows networks may start to reverse this trend i am like others i will not support any new shows until they have been given a second season i'll then possibly make a decision to watch and catch up via and online viewing until then abc you have lost me as a viewer to any new show
this is one creepy movie creepier than anything david lynch and that shows what a great director polanski is since this is not his usual type of work and it is all starts of with trelkovski moves into a tenement block in paris he soon learns that the previous tenant a young woman committed suicide and he believes the rest of the people living there drove her to it he also believes that they are trying to do the same to him what results is a amazing and frightening look at whole production has classical horror written all over it from the imagery to the music the viewer can feel poor terror building they all out to kill him or maybe just drive him mad is there a difference find out for yourself
i think this show is definitely the greatest show jessica alba does such a great job in it michael weatherly also does an awesome job as well as the rest of the cast the show is very intriguing and they have wonderful storylines and their stunts are amazing like watching a movie definitely worth watching

this movie is good for tv i like it because i'm a huge fan of disaster films even though this is a family film accuracy on the film from the book is half-and-half they got the characters names right but in the book there was no storm chaser the the car scene involving the hatch family running away from the tornado wasn't in the book instead it involved dan hatch and his friend riding with a police officer on their way to the police station for safety and in the book dan and his friend are both old thats all i can think of overall this was a good movie even though it could of have been a little more accurate to the book did you know the book was based on a true story of a series of tornadoes devastating a small nebraska town in
casomai was the last movie i've seen before getting married just last year was also the first movie i've searched for after i was married because we promised to offer a copy to our reality is not that apart from fiction to all those who wrote that priests like don camillo don't exist in real life i would recommend them to visit my priest pe nuno westwood in estoril portugal all others i would only recommend them to see this movie before and after the i do day ribeiro portugal
one of the best if not the best rock'n'roll movies ever and not just mindless fun there really were a lot of clever jokes in it of course i love the ramones but with all the anarchy and the i hate high school themes the film doesn't at all take itself too is great about first saw the movie in the spring of and i saw it again recently since i went to high school in the late it made me kind of nostalgic i said this film doesn't take itself that seriously and isn't pretentious like so much other teen fare of the seventies eighties and nineties and to speak of not really dirty or disgusting either only pg rated rare for a movie in this category a great cult classic and a truly incredible time capsule
in i visited the lake elsinore glider-port and flew a yellow pratt read sailplane returning to germany the above serious ran on tv and one segment was about the high altitude sailplane flights in california in the early real life pilot was bill ivans i don't know who played him in the series it turned out that the sailplane in the film was the same n-number as the one i had flown at lake elsinore ever since i saw that segment i have been searching for it and have been wondering if it is somewhere available segments in that serious were about the baker ejection seat an instrument to find avalanche victims etc
having seen charley boorman in long way round with ewan mcgregor i was very interested to see how charley would be in his own show i thought charley came across as a lovely guy who is very grounded and down to earth its nice to see that celebrities struggle with their weight and fitness it just their human too i don't know a lot about bikes but this show gripped me right from the start the preparation and organising for this event seems immense the event itself seems very dangerous and i'm fascinated to see why charley and everyone else is doing it and how far he gets i love the pace of the show and the fast upbeat music i can't believe he broke his collar bone i really hope its not the end i cant wait to see the next episode
this movie documents the harlem ball circuit of the mid eighties much more fun than than palazzo volpi though just as diseased this movie is a true gem of squalor one cannot help but sympathize with the characters because of their freakness the sole purpose of middle class intellectuals is to document the phenomenons of the trash and the glitz here the most genius of trash is extremely well documented and duly glamorized the characters penchant for idolatry of all that is glamorous inspires even more adoration of the characters themselves on part of the viewer creating a phenomenon of a phenomenon effect which makes this movie a piece of art
i loved this film when i was little today at it is one of my all time favorite animated films beautiful animation and appealing characters are just two of the things to like about this film although many people might not enjoy some of the songs most of them are well-done and go along with the story it focuses on charlie a roguish handsome german shepard who may seem unlikable to some at first but eventually will win you a kiddie film by any means often very dark and frightening at times a treat for don bluth fans and animation buffs but do keep a tissue in handy adgth never fails to make me cry and will do the same for those who are movie sensitive arguably one of the greatest non-disney animated films of all time along with watership down and my neighbor line a heavenly masterpiece
the plot is tight the acting is flawless the directing script scenery casting are all well done i watch this movie frequently though i don't know what it is about the whole thing that grabs me see it and drop me a line if you can figure out why i like it so much
another norman lear hit detailing the problems that african americans had to go through in the turbulent and esther rolle and husband along with children living in a chicago high-rise project in a predominantly black neighborhood the show depicted what black people were going through with a landlord agent mr bookman as well as prices and the day-to-day problems of just children depicted how people seem to face their problems from the comical jj to the militant ralph carter to their daughter who also aspired to attain success this show was a perfect description of african-american life
this story is a complex and wonderful tale of the last harem of the ottoman empire well told and provoking we see the inner workings of a world now gone and learn about the people who lived enjoyed the story characters acting and scenes a few scenes suffered from quick editing and the sub titles sometimes disappeared too quickly otherwise a wonderful main character safiya is played wonderfully by marie gillain who i am pleased to say did a fantastic job without over doing it the scenes with her and alex descas are charming and recommend this film for anybody looking to watch something less hollywood and more authentic to the world they are emulating
twenty five years ago i showed this film in some classes in entomology and can still remember the excitement of the kids they were spellbound it is not just about the termites who have built and live in the castles of clay but also about the other animals who use the mounds there is a fantastic scene in which a cobra fights a monitor lizard while a colony of mongooses watch it is a not only good for entomology classes but also for teaching about ecology since there is so much about the interactions between the termites and other organisms and the whole ecology of all of the organisms that live in and around the mounds wish it was available on dvd so that i could watch it again and show others
creative use of modern and mystical elements cadillac convertible to transport evil stepmother kathleen turner waters serial mom and the twisted sisters queen mab as the faerie godmother david warner in time bandits in redcoat at court cinderella a babe shovelling coal into an insatiable furnace cinderella and her prince charming both look like act like rock stars isle of man locations
this had a good had a nice pace and all characters are developed watched a whole bunch of movies in the last two weeks and this had to be the best one i've seen in the two character was the best though it was small it was cleverly crafted from the very may be a romantic comedy and i don't like most but the writing direction performing sound design overall in all capacity just was really thought out pretty film scored pretty high out of all the i've seen lately and the rest were big budget or better job in writing
one of the unsung gems of the scenes features razor-sharp satire and outstanding performances from arnetia walker did she not get a ton of roles after wallace shawn a delicious send-up of class warfare and the people in those classes the writing is hilarious and the characters while not subtle are nuanced and sorry but the asian gangs you can call one japanese guy extorting one of the other characters a gang were not put in for sociological value as another review implies they should been the value here lies in what the movie is making fun of and in the sparklingly wicked way it does it i found it creative funny and idiosyncratic
this movie was incredible i would recommend it to anyone much better than what i had already anticipated it was definitely a heart-wrenching spectacular movie it is an amazing story with amazing actors and creators definitely another great movie with denzel washington surprise anyone derek luke did a wonderful job as well
i am not a very good writer so i'll keep this short world at war is the best wwii documentary that i've seen i've seen different wwii documentaries only american and this documentary seems to be the most complete wwii documentary that i've seen i think it could talk a bit more about the great depression and hitler got to power but it does a very good job at covering the war it seems to be complete and to everyone it does not exaggerate or diminish roles of different nations it has a lot of original footage including color footage and many eye witnesses was made in when a lot more were alive it has great music and narrator all-in-all i gave this one because that good haven't seen specials in dvd version so i cannot comment on those
deeply emotional it can't leave you a love story between years old boys but only the body of this movie and been removed you only feel what happened with these boys you feel the soul of the movie with of course some action some sex but this is no pornography too many was only a summer story and it became from love to hate almost to death the most important time of their lives i loved it you will too whatever your feelings are
josef von sternberg directs this magnificent silent film about silent hollywood and the former imperial general to the czar of russia who has found himself there emil jannings won a well-deserved oscar in part for his role as the general who ironically is cast in a bit part in a silent picture as a russian general the movie flashes back to his days in russia leading up to the fall to revolutionaries william powell makes his big screen debut as the hollywood director who casts jannings in his film the film serves as an interesting look at the fall of russia and at an imitation of behind-the-scenes tinseltown in the early days von sternberg delivers yet another classic and one that is filled with the great elements of romance intrigue and tragedy
if you have any sort of appreciation for character and dialogue and any sense of american cultural history you will find a lot of very absorbing material in this film it probably was originally a play and why dialogue heavy but i can't stress enough how these icons that we only have a shallow understand of are made into truly complex and wonderful film is better than any college course for telling you how to create a character-driven
in this documentary we meet roger the rich manager of a factory in china that makes beads and other trinkets sold and traded at mardi gras in new orleans roger claims the factory girls love their work and are grateful for the opportunities it provides but interviews with four of them tell quite another story the girls bleak lives are shown in stark contrast to the bizarre excesses of mardi gras itself filmmaker david redmon should be lauded for getting excellent and rare footage of everyday life inside a chinese factory compound and for landing a revealing on-camera interview with the head of the company that imports and sells the beads the movie is compellingly told and clearly serves its purpose as a window into what lies behind those ubiquitous made in china labels
this movie just pulls you so deeply into the two main characters i popped it into my laptop without even reading the cover alone reviews and was intrigued for two solid hours two lost ships from two different worlds collide the sexual tension that brews between a secretary and a criminal is almost palpable even without hardly any physical contact toward the end i couldn't decide which i wanted more our hero and heroine to pull off their caper or simply consummate their passion rml could've done without a curious subplot and a traditional minutes would have been plenty i'm nitpicking though after a series of netflix blockbuster and local library duds this movie restored my faith in great film making
i absolutely loved this film i was hesitant to watch it at first because i thought it would be too painful i remember how hard it was when john was shot however watching the two of us took me back to a happier time when he was still alive and there was hope and possibility i think that the writer did an amazing job depicting what might have been aidan quinn was adorable as paul and met the challenge head on i was impressed with his accent and mannerisms jared harris is also very talented and was quite believable as john my favorite parts were the scene in the park and the rooftop scene which was so poignant the film left me with both sadness and satisfaction both of which i feel are appropriate given the circumstances
i didn't mind all the walking people really did walk places back then it loaned an air of authenticity to this period piece and some perspective on the technology of the martians i too was disappointed by the effects in particular the thunderchild scene which i regard as one of the most exciting in the book but i can't praise this film enough for its faithfulness to story about time the actors are likable and the performances are charming also this film is very much worth seeing just to hear jamie truly great musical score it was interesting to see the same actor play both the writer and his brother in london
well would firstly like to clarify that kaakha kaakha is a part of a tamil prayer and roughly translated it means to protect khakhee on the other hand refers to the color of the police uniform is the tamil film industry is rather full of purely commercial ventures any rajnikanth or vijay movie would stand testament to that kaakha kaakha is an excellent movie with a great soundtrack certainly very stunning in the final scene especially love the ending is certainly unexpected the gore is rather too much at times but certainly this is a great movie
reading a wide variety of scoop reviews over the past few days i walked into the theater prepared for a subpar outing from woody happily i couldn't have been more wrong granted woody the performer is slowing down a touch or two but woody the is in fine form and found a credible way to integrate his old self into the story judging from the laughter and guffaws the audience ate up one-liners and dialogue in a way that i haven't seen in several years a movie landscape dominated by software-approved story arcs twentysomething tastes and assembly-line formula fare for kiddies a source of both satisfaction and inspiration to see allen pursuing his highly personal and still-rewarding path
i have not seen this movie but i must having read all three of thor books tiki ra and aku aku i am actively looking for a copy of this thesis that peruvians migrated to polynesia is alive and well considering that this crew had no gps and only an old fashioned valve radio with a output their voyage was heroic to say the reply to this message if you can tell me the location of a copy of this would be interested in buying it
i absolutely loved this show i watched it from the time it first aired in the late to the very last episode in my honest opinion it was a wonderful family drama that is so rare these days definitely a show you could watch with a friend or your children yes things have changed a bit with jo since we last saw her in the books but still compelling with great stories and good lessons the actress that portrays jo bhaer burke does a wonderful job as does as the actor who plays nick riley rochfort throughout the series we get to see the developing romance between jo and nick as well as the daily stories and lessons the kids and students learn i recommend this show to anyone
haven't seen the film since first released but it was memorable performances by rip torn and conchata farrell were superb photography excellent moving story line and everything else about it was of the highest standard yet it seems to have been pretty much because uk is an odd market for it but i haven't seen the film on tv or video which is sad has it had more success in us where it might rightly be seen as a quite accurate historical reckon that of a good film is the music and though i'm not certain i think the title theme was a simple but moving clarinet solo of what a friend we have in jesus the film then went on to disprove that am i right or wrong
firstly i would like to point out that people who have criticised this film have made some glaring errors anything that has a rating below is clearly utter is an absolutely fantastic film with amazing film effects the actors are highly believable the narrative thought provoking and the horror and graphical content extremely disturbing is much mystique in this film many questions arise as the audience are revealed to the strange and freakish creature that makes habitat in the dark rat ridden tunnels how was craig created and what happened to fantastic film with a large chill factor a film with so many unanswered questions and a film that needs to be appreciated along with others like days later the bunker dog soldiers and forward to more of these fantastic films
this is one of the most spiritual movies i have ever seen i headed up with about people to st george and we saw this movie in the visiting center of the st george temple not one person had dry eyes in the audience also there were some religious and anti-mormon people in the audience who felt the spirit of the movie and were touched by the captivating music and reenactment of the story of the pioneers and the hardships they faced because of their recommend this movie for anyone who wishes to understand more about joseph and the hardships that the pioneers went through after all it is apart of american history
what a real treat and quite unexpected this is what a real thriller movie is all about i rushed into the video shop grabbed a movie without reading the entire blurb on the back and hoped for the best i was totally surprised and delighted i really enjoyed the actors and their characters i thought they all gave a great performance and made their characters realistic the plot was well thought written and directed it kept you interested from start to finish and never got boring for a single highly recommend this movie for those that like thrillers especially thrillers that are well paced and ones that keep your attention definitely a out of from me
a wonderful film by powell and pressburger whose work i now want to explore more the film is about what we perceive as real and what is real and how the two can be so difficult to distinguish from one another beautifully shot and acted although david niven doesn't seem to be years old as his character claims to be fun to see a very young richard attenborough this film made me think while i was watching it and afterwards
in her first nonaquatic role esther williams plays a school teacher the victim of sexual assault she gives a fine performance proving she could be highly effective out of the swimming pool as the detective out to solve the case george nader gives perhaps his finest performance and he is so handsome it hurts john saxon is the student under suspicion and although he gets impressive billing in the credits edward andrews as his overly-protective father who is the in glorious technicolor the unguarded moment is irresistible hokum and at times compelling drama
oh what fun there is here heckerling has a flair for directing comedy times at ridgemont high look talking but here it looks like she told the actors to go out and have fun micheal keaton breezes through the role of johnny easily his best screen performance joe piscopo is great as the appropriately named danny vermin what a shame directors didn't pick up on this and i have even mentioned richard dimitri playing moronie and the unique vocabulary i don't think an accident that the bulk of the name is spelled lines are sprinkled throughout the movie with peter boyle griffit stapleton merilu henner given good lines even actors with minor roles like dick butkus and alan hale get in a good it to a friend
i believe they were telling the truth the whole cant trust anything in the wild they family went through poor boys too young to understand what was going on around them but still having to deal with the rumours as well as dealing with the lose of their little sister i cant believe this case went on for so like the jury couldn't see the truth even if it bit them on the feel for this family and if i could let them know i hate what has happened to them i have no idea what they went through i cant even imagine it after watching this movie i was in tears and had to check on my little girl in think everyone should watch this
i borrowed modified title from some other comment i have to say that as i usually don't like relationship series i really did liked this one great characters interesting and not cliché story good acting good and again not cliché in case of dialogs is rather rare dialogs it is really interesting how the characters cross paths with each other and sometimes knowingly sometimes more or less at random influence each others lives but unfortunately as we say in our country do you know how do you recognize a good us series it is the one that got canceled before the end of the first season sure it isn't always true but
the best part of an american in paris is the lengthy ballet sequence at the end where gene kelly and leslie caron are the living personification of several major painters kelly has earlier been established as a pavement artist in paris so the sequence is the logical ending to a musical bursting with life and energy gershwin tunes and cast members like georges guetary and oscar levant kelly was at his best here a little different to singin in the rain and the effect of all the film as one topped with the ballet gives it a definite wow factor no wonder the sequence ended entertainment after all other mgm musical highlights had gone by
this is one of the funnier films i've seen it had crude moments but they were full of charm altmanesque screenplay brilliant physical humour and relaxed friendships were a pleasure to watch and a slice of life most of us can relate to and i can say with a measure of honesty that i was afraid for steve truly was surprisingly this is a good-natured unabashed comedy that is essentially about love and the many relationships we may find ourselves in along the way catherine keener was terrific as trish and all of steve friends were flawed but amiable and so much fun the idea that they suspected that carell was a serial killer is a hilarious metaphor for a forty-year old virgin but the simple truth was that he wanted to be in love first original charming and very funny highly recommended
this was what black society was like before the crack epidemics gangsta rap and aids that beset the ghettos in the eighties decent hardworking families that struggled to get by and all the traumas and tribulations they faced black america was a different group of people in the seventies still full of hope and flying high on the civil rights movements of the sixties times were hard but still worth fighting for keepin your head above water making a wave when you can this show showed how black society struggled to work together as people and families before they started to prey on each other and everyone else in order to survive the horrors of the ghettos it is heart-breaking to see what the black ghettos were like then and what they have become now
this film was amazing it is an inspiring piece of cinema the characters are fully developed through the truth in which director lucy walker brings to the film i highly recommend this to any one looking for that special film that shows the humanity in the human condition lucy wlaker showcases the landscape beauty this film id a true example of man vs nature and sometimes man vs man the inner turmoil and triumph is tremendous in its subject matter the subject of how the tiebtans view blindness as a sign of demons is interesting this film sheds light on a particular culture that has never been showcased lucy walker has given erik weihenmayer a voice when he would have not normally been heard thank you lucy for being true to your vison as a filmmaker
i really loved this film yes i know it was fairly far fetched there is no way that shelby car could have managed to stay on the road as well as the with all traction control and other gizmos but other than that the whole film was well put together cage was excellent as usual and the rest of the cast were also pretty good with the exception of the brit bad guy he was a little too much don't you think anyway great film great cars and great acting i for one made sure my car was locked and alarmed in my remotely controlled garage that night
zentropa is the most original movie i've seen in years if you like unique thrillers that are influenced by film noir then this is just the right cure for all of those hollywood summer blockbusters clogging the theaters these days von follow-ups like breaking the waves have gotten more acclaim but this is really his best work it is flashy without being distracting and offers the perfect combination of suspense and dark humor too bad he decided handheld cameras were the wave of the future hard to say who talked him away from the style he exhibits here but loss that he went into his heavily theoretical dogma direction instead
the in cold blood was perhaps more like the real thing about it would we really want to see the real thing but it was black and white in a color world and a lot of people didn't even know what it was and there was an opportunity to remake it for television plus if you remake it you can show some stuff not shown in the original the book in cold blood by truman capote was the first nonfiction novel book was in fact not true to the real story i thought the canadian location sufficed for kansas pretty much for a tv movie look for the elements of sex drugs and rock n roll womanizing perry being an aspirin junkie perry playing blues guitar
zombie chronicles isn't something to shout about obvious not a award winning movie but it is a entertaining b-movie directed by brad sykes who directed camp blood which was another entertaining low budget flick the acting is bad like most cheaply made movies but what makes it more entertaining the zombie make-up is cool and effective especially with the budget the gore is also great and gross the film is sort of like a zombie version of tales from the crypt since we get two tales about zombie encounters in the woods the stories are fun and do leave you guessing especially the first tale zombie chronicles is a lot better than some low budget zombie movies out there if you love low budget b-movies or cheaply made zombie flicks then check out zombie chronicles
this movie is and the music is very movie moonwalker was meant to coincide with the album have is movie begins with michael jackson in the shows a history of his early days in the jackson right up to the bad era badder is good is a music video parody of the music video for bad the then shows the speed demon song and the video are good for leave me appears it shows the movie a few plays smooth criminal in a club called club it when he does the to see bye
super mario is undoubtedly the greatest game ever created it is so addicting that you could play it for hours upon hours without stopping for a break i've beaten the game times but i've never gotten all gotten i hope to achieve them eventually even though i didn't officially play this game until i was seven in i loved watching my sisters play it now i am and still play this erasing games and starting over graphics are unbelievable for an early game the gameplay is addictive the controls are great the levels are tough but not impossible the bowser fights are would like to tell you more but why don't you just get it for yourself put the x-box and the wii away and go find yourself a nintendo and play this amazing wonderful game
guinea pig the experiment is without a doubt stars on first view its a raw realistic creepy and disturbing look into the dark side of human nature this movie gets right to the point you may be thinking what point the point is to satisfy of just extreme violence and gore this movie has some gore more or less just torturing a women violently there are really only that could be considered gore i'll tell you one thing though guinea pig the experiment makes hostile look like sesame street if you thought hostile was a crazy brutal disturbing torture flick then you ain't seen the half of it until you've seen guinea pig the rating gore pig the experiment
i have been watching this show since i was and i've loved it ever since i love this show because just plain funny you will enjoy this show a lot because it shows something new and funnier everyday and my favorite part is when benny always has her last comments on george after every punchline about his fat giant i would laugh and i'd watch it with my friends at home it'd be like we were watching a funny movie but short love george lopez funny this is a cool-funny-family comedy series enjoyable to everyone and you will definitely enjoy did and if you haven't watched it yet i suggest that you start watching because you wouldn't want to stop watching it even though there aren't anymore brand new episodes i still enjoy the re-runs still funny never wears off
baseketball is awesome hilarious and so damned funny that you will wet your pants laughing i have seen it so many times i have stopped counting but everytime it gets me on this is a surefire hit and i loved it and will continue to love it i hope one day there will be a special edition dvd brought thumbs up
as someone who has lived with cerebral palsey for over forty years i find this movie to be inspirational if someone with such a severe case of cp as christie brown has can do so much then no reason that i couldn't achieve my own dreams daniel day-lewis and brenda fricker both give awesome
this is the one movie to see if you are to wed or are a married couple the movie portrais a couple in italy and deals with such difficult topics as abortion infidelity juggling work and so called culture of death that we are experiencing nowadays in the world is terrible and this movie will surely make you must see i hope it gets distributed as it on the cast and thumbs up and a star evaluation from me
jared diamond made a point in the first episode that other peoples of the world didn't have animals to domesticate but europeans did and that accounts for why we were able to make steel and invent complex machines it is obvious that the person who wrote this comment hasn't understood the reasoning behind this documentary or the original book please don't ruin this great piece by your simple mindedness the reasons are far more complex than the single thing you mentioned please read the book as is it a great source of information i enjoyed it a lot this book is even a taught as a text book at some universities
right from the start you see that anchors aweigh is a great comedy gene kelly and frank sinatra make such a funny team the songs they sing together are pure entertainment kathryn grayson is gorgeous and really sweet dean stockwell is the cutiest child actor i've never seen if you are fond of piano you'll be amazed by josé iturbi this movie was the first one to combine animation with real actors and it did that wonderfully in an unforgettable dance number undoubtedly one of funniest movies
though i liked on the town better i really liked it i'm a new comer when it comes to frank sinatra and gene kelly though i had heard of them i had never seen anything with them in it until recently the first one i saw was singin in the rain that made me a fan of i think that is better too but i thought that this movie was good and like all movies there are some parts that are better than others but in my book an awesome movie and i love it frank and gene make a good team i have yet to see them together in take me out to the ballgame but i'm sticking to my guns bu saying that i really enjoyed it and that i love it
the matador pierce brosnan greg kinnear hope davis philip baker hall dylan baker brosnan gives one of his best non-bondian roles as a middle-aged assassin facing a mid-life crisis while on assignment in mexico where he befriends a square yet likable american businessman at his most affable and discovers there is more to life than death newbie filmmaker richard shepard makes a solid big screen debut with a pointedly wicked black comedy with a sharp eye for visual detail and nuanced dialogue and character development that makes him a talent to watch in this breath-of-fresh-air into the buddy comedy formula skewering what is anticipated of his leads and allowing brosnan to get his ya-yas out with devilish glee a sleeper gem indie hit
anyone find it interesting that the ood look strangely similar to the great cthulhu of h p lovecraft vintage hmmm pair of episodes referring to billie piper as most seem to do in the impossible planet and the satan the link to legion i think also used in who before and also referring to satan in various novels post exorcist suspense episodes utilising fear and faith elements the new team for these are working great magic for certainly creates new fears and hide behind the sofa feelings not seen for many many years in this continuation of a superb bbc series it is confirmed by the bbc that billie piper is quitting perhaps not permanently after end of series
if you haven't seen this obscure little charmer you should seek it out it is the story of a bumbling wartime sad sack macmurray who is listed each time he attempts to join any branch of the military he finds a magic lamp which of course contains a genie sheldon but the genie is even more bumbling than macmurray is sending him across time to serve in all the wrong times and places than the one he wants it is cute cheerful and pure fluff and you can't help but like it the plots is much like a disney film particularly since the two stars and sheldon both made numerous disney films in the and although not together needless to say it all ends well for everyone and the viewer goes away feeling pretty good
after having seen marrying mafia i'd nearly lost my faith in korean movie business but this one brought my faith female character who is university student forced to teach the spoiled rich but charistmatic high school student guy he is actually female age through some hilarious quarrells these two end up being great was pleasantly surprised that newcomer kwan sang woo did his job with excellency he was such a revelation actress kim ha nul was also charming as movie tried hard to avoid any cliches that can be seen in typical romantic comedies and it didn't show us any unnecessary nude sex scenes it was brilliant lovely fresh made me want to see it
the and in my view the best of the blackadder only downside is that there is no lord percy who was the funniest character from the previous series but hugh prince regent is suitably madcap laugh a a package quality through and through with convincing regency sets superb cutting sarcasm and little bits of the wacky the macbeth actors standing out and prince georges lucky us chicken impression and the missing words from dr comedies have been quite as both clever as they are funny okay the odd lame observation or line gets in but mostly a scream
i saw the new redubbed and edited version yesterday and loved it then i went home and watched it with subtitles and i loved it i am ready to watch it am a sucker for the mild mannered secret identity and what could be more mild mannered than a pacifist librarian the scenes where he reveals his super powers to his friends or absent mindedly forgets to be meek are my course the martial arts are stunning there is really not much i can say about them if you are familiar with the hk style however if you are not we paused playback briefly and walker texas ranger was on we noticed that after every strike there was a cut not in black
ya that is what i think sure it was still a great show with john in it but i personally think that it is way better love having and grandpa living at the house because they are so funny john was still around i really didn't laugh as much as i do is too bad that no more are being made i don't think because i would love to see some new favorite character must be rory poor rory is almost always left out it is always about bridget or carrie what about rory honestly this is a great show and to any one who has never watched it you must go and watch it i almost guarantee you will laugh well even chuckle
sequel to the kingdom is bloodier and even more twisted i only saw half was exhausted and couldn't sit through all hours but i loved what i saw ghosts blood murder poisoning mutated babies has it all if you have a strong stomach and like weird movies this is for you don't have to see part to understand figure it anyone know if kingdom and are available on dvd sitting through these marathon movies in a theatre is tiring there probably won't be a kingdom jaregard died a year after this was filmed but you never know
i am not going to lie this is a great movie i saw it about months ago at my local theatre i saw it a second time and i was somewhat bored in the slow scenes sid sloth is not all that flattering but diego mountain lion i think is really good in the movie the animation is outstanding and the story has a touching ending it is worth taking kids and under to but teens would probably find it a tad bit boring also the uniqueness in the characters is so interesting like i said it is a pretty good movie but i would rate toy story or shrek higher
although i gave a rating of my expectations were higher than what the film delivered i would have been happier had there been more deep diving since i am a diver myself but it was supposed to portray the life of carl brashear and what it was about this film made me angry in the beginning but happy in the end
just the kind of movie i love some very good british actors as well as the one and only sharon stone catherine tramell masterfully manipulates a well educated group of lives playing on their frailties to collect experiences to write a murder mystery book she plays the female psychopath quite well while using her ample sex appeal to convincingly portray what could be considered one of the ultimate black widows tramell is use to dark places within society and freely partakes in sadomasochistic flings in the never visit after dark side of town from the beginning there is nothing short of an r rating here from the dialog alone stone could also be described as a sort of female hannibal lecter an emotionless femme fatal without the meal plan
even if you're not a big ramones fan rock n roll high school is the greatest rock n roll movie ever made why because under all the campiness it treats with respect the contempt and loathing teens often feel justifiably so for the boring stupid fascist establishment world of adults that final scene is one of the most glorious and uplifting final scenes to a movie i have ever seen mine eyes have seen the glory of the rock n
i believe i received this film when i was a young buck i remembered watching it as a child but i could never find the film i remembered good ol rageddy ann andy babette the greedy king koo koo i searched high and low for this movie and still no luck but one day when i was moving out of my childhood home i had found it we were reunited i am years old now i still watch it all the time actually one of the funniest and touching movies i have ever seen and enjoyed at the same time and personally i think they should make a sequel mmm yes a sequel indeed now i am even considering getting the captains bird tattooed somewhere on my body
i saw this film without to know what about were i'm a fan of branagh even more his shakespeare films and in the beginning i saw it only for this and i finished with tears in my eyes because the great great serenity values affect and brave philosophy about life of girl recommended to people who are bored with tv programming spain at least
this spectacular film is one of the most amazing movies i have ever seen it shows a china i had never seen or imagined and i believe it shows china in the most real light ever seen in a movie it is absolutely heart-breaking in so many situations seeing how hard life was for the characters and yet the story and the ending are incredibly joyful you truly see the depths and heigths of human existence in this film the actors are all perfect such that you feel like you have really entered a different world simply can not recommend this movie highly enough it may just change you forever once you have seen it
masayuki suo who directed this fine film is on a role after the decent fancy dance and the classic japan anyway college-sumo comedy shiko funjatta suo has followed his own huge footsteps with a smashing story is engaging we both laugh often takenaka is hilarious as he is in two previous films and really root for the characters but to me the big bonus is the look this movie gives the viewer into japanese society real life in japan suo has a knack for showing real-life activities with entertaining flair the result is a movie that will pull you in make you laugh make you think and both entertain you and give you insight into look for the the main actors from shiko funjatta as they all appear again in various roles from supporting characters to short cameos
the beginning of this film is a little clunky and also confusing but sit tight because you are in for the ride of your life the concept is compelling with interesting devices utilized to tell the overall story there are fine performances all around with phillip seymour being the best of the cast-no surprise there ethan hawke also deserves credit for a very strong performance as well the direction by mr lumet is outstanding the film has a seventies feel in the respect that risks are taken in the telling of this story but unlike the majority of trite films that populate the landscape today this is a thriller that is sincerely based upon relationships rather than special effects or product plugs you will be greatly rewarded for the time invested in this film
very different topic treated in this film a straightforward and simple description of local chinese customs by looking at the daily operation of a public bath run by the old owner and his retarded son when older son returns home wrongly believing his father has died how every man in town makes his daily visit to chat play games discuss personal matters and get honest advice besides the usual spa-like therapies when old man dies strong and loyal family ties make older son take charge so public bath operation is not disrupted and finally the arrival of modernization to end this way of spending relaxed hours and getting along the public bath has to be demolished making place for a commercial complex to be constructed
famous was famous for their tension and release style of cartoon where the semi-main character is in terrible peril only to be rescued by the hero at the last second this particular casper is the only one i can remember where death actually takes a hand but even in death there is still a happy constant in famous studios cartoons is that virtue always triumphs popeye always gets to his spinach in time baby huey always out-foxes the fox little audery always learns her lesson and some fs cartoons are really dark and have to give them credit as much as i love looney tunes and tom and jerry i don't think anyone was putting out a better cartoon product at that time than paramount color animation music great winston sharples editing voices they were consistent and a glowing example of the best that the art form had to offer
amazing that so many people that i know haven't seen this little gem everybody i have turned on to it have come back with the same reaction what a great never much cared for brad pitt his turns in monkeys and fight club show improvement but his performance in this film as a psycho is unnerving dark and right on else in the film gives excellent performances and the slow and deliberate pacing greatly enhance the proceedings the sense of dread for the characters keeps increasing as they come to realize what has been really only thing that keeps this from a in my book is that compared to what came before it the ending is a bit too long and overblown but the only flaw i could find in this cult you check this film out try to get the letterboxed unrated cut for the best viewing
the woman in black is easily one of the creepiest british ghost stories ever young arriving in a small town to handle a dead haunted by a mysterious woman dressed all in film is loaded with extremely eerie atmosphere and the frights are calculated for and deliver the maximum effect action keeps the viewer deeply involved and the finale is quite acting is excellent and the tension is almost unbearable at if you want to see a truly creepy horror film give this one a dare anyone to watch the woman in black alone at night with the lights out of
dressed to kill is a mystery horror film from brian de palma and it really atmosphere is right atmosphere that makes you isn't that what a horror film is supposed to the actors are in the right caine is perfect as dr robert elliott the shrink with a little dickinson as kate miller the sexually frustrated mature woman is gordon as her son peter is allen as liz blake the call girl is franz does his typical detective detective marino is one of the most colorful in this are plenty of creepy scenes in this elevator scene is one of have been made comparisons between this and alfred psycho are some similarities between these two of these movies may cause some sleepless nights
i am amazed that movies like this can still be made i watch all kinds of movies all the time with my friends and i can say that this is one of the best i ever seen never thinked that a movie of minutes can make me think about it on and charismatic and intense as ever plays creasy a washed-up ex-counter-terrorist agent taken to the bottle once assigned to protect young pita fanning in mexico city his emotional and redemptive arc is jump-started in the way only an adorable little girl can provide inevitably pita is kidnapped by thugs and creasy decides that most of mexico city must pay the price for daring to take away his teddy-bear-clutching catalyst yes he has man on fire must see this movie
just a comment on new orleans earlier reviewer noted the following this film could have been shot in new york or another northern big city because it presents us with characters that speak more like broklynese than maybe a southern accent one might hear in that part of the country there was also another comment along these lines from an english people in new orleans do in fact sound broklynese i have never found out why mentioned in a confederacy of dunces by john kennedy toole i always appreciate movies taking place in new orleans that include this detail as this one did too often just the hollywood version of the standard southern accent
on second viewing of this movie i like it even more than the first time it is full of nuances and a perception of life as being quite ordinary and often fearful but what lifts this movie to a height rarely realized is its focus on the little incidences in our lives to which we normally only offer the briefest of attention spans here the movie spins into the celebration of these incidences the meeting of a tow truck driver and client the jogger hearing a cry from the bushes the dialogue acting casting and direction are superb no two by fours no grand revelations what i did observe was how true the characters were to their basic natures and how enhanced their lives became when these were celebrated kudos to all involved in this we need more grand canyons in our lives out of
first of all i think the below comment is unworthy for a site like this obviously you have no taste and you don't respect the taste of others not to give you a history lesson but i think it needs to be done black actors out there are just if not more successful as others if you are not a part of the black race you cannot understand the quality creativeness and vibrant of old movies such as sparkle and mahogany and cooley high since unfortunately you are not black you do not have the pleasure of feeling what we feel when we watch these classics so therefore you need to keep your freaking mouth shut and just stick to your non-dancing race thanks
the movie i thought was excellent it was suppose to be about romance with a little suspense in stewart is a wonderful actor i don't know why people keep giving him a bad rap as for mel harris she is a great actress and for those who thinks she looks too old for rob only by five had a lead role in his own tv series as well as one on the scifi channel i'm sure you remember topical heat aka sweating bullets and painkiller also starred in a number of tv movies and is now making a tv mini need to give him more leading roles that is what he is best at
i loved the real mc coys it is too bad that lydia reed has decided to be forgotten and not appear she was excellent in the show of course walter brennan was great as well as tony martínez i loved it when he called amos señor have purchased season i on dvd and i cannot wait to buy seasons only there would be more shows on television like this one everything would be better this show appeared briefly in the summer of but then disappeared god bless all the departed members of the cast and reed make yourself known again to the public you are loved and respected the real mc coys will live forever
a powerful adaptation of the best-selling book and the smash broadway play about the lives of bessie and sadie delany two colored sisters who lived past the age of wonderfully played in their old age by ruby dee and diahann carroll respectively they tell their story in flashbacks to amy hill hearth by amy madigan a white new york times reporter the flashback and present-day scenes don't have as much inspirational value in them as in the book but really are powerful however certain aspects of the sisters lives such as the inter-racial background of their mother and the reasons behind their stern personality are not presented clearly you need to read the book to fully understand these things which is just as well because the just as great aside from those flaws wonderfully done and performed especially by dee and carroll and a very powerful and educational movie
i missed almost all of the first season but when the other shows went to reruns i started watching i ended up buying the entire first season off itunes this is now one of my favorite comedy shows patrick warburton is the key his dry sense of humor has me rolling all the time david spade is funny but sometimes a little russell goes a long way i enjoy the other cast members more not saying he doesn't add to the yourself a favor if you haven't checked this one out give it a try if you can catch the episode where jeff goes to the sperm bank you will see how good this show hope this series has a long run
john waters has given us a genuinely enjoyable film this certainly isn't without its shocking waters-esque moments but it is tamer than his older culty stuff such as pink flamingoes pecker harkens back to early mainstream stage in that it reminds the viewer of the same kind of humor that was evident in polyester overall a really fun comedy with some great moments
first of all i am a butch straight white male but even with that handicap i love this movie about real people a real time and place and of course new york city in the i had many gay friends growing up in new york in the eighties and the one thing about them i always admired was their courage to live their lives the way they wanted to live them no matter what the consequences courageous you have to admire that this is a great film watch it and take in what it was like to be a flamboyant african american or hispanic gay man in the new york of the eighties real life bottom line real life
gene tierney and dana andrews who were both so memorable in laura re-teamed for this excellent embittered policeman andrews as mark can't get over the fact that his father was a hoodlum who died in a police shootout while trying to break out of jail as a result of his bitterness mark doesn't know when to stop using his hands this inability that leads to the accidental death of a small-time trying to frame gangster gary merrill mark unintentionally puts the heat on innocent cab-drive tom tully who is the father of gene tierney who was separated by is a well-thought out film dealing with the conscience of a basically decent human ending is not exactly upbeat as mark will have to face the music at least he finally admits to what he has done
this is a must see for independant movie fans but it also holds up well against mainstream movies i think we have the makings of the next woody allen tarrentino budget is painfully low no special effects whatsoever and they seemingly used ambient lighting in digital video yet this movie grabs hold of you and never lets go the screenplay is somewhat bizarre yet the actors and director pull it off with complete realism it has humor it has intrigue and it has pathos and it all works point in describing the details if you want to see an a virtual lesson in how to make a low budget flick that really works see this yeah also really
gene kelly frank sinatra kathryn grayson and jose iturbi star in anchors aweigh directed by george and sinatra are joe and clarence two navy guys on leave in hollywood they meet a little boy stockwell and on taking him home they meet his aunt clarence falls for her she wants an audition for jose iturbi they try to help but a is a very energetic musical with great dancing and singing by kelly and sinatra kelly gets to dance with jerry the mouse in a delightful sequence grayson sings jalousie and my heart sings not one of my favorite voices but she does well piano work is gets to show his versatility and why the girls swooned over him with those big blue eyes and boyish face for kelly this was a major break for him at movie very buoyant
i have always like this great baseball movie it has a good cast including two tremendous actors and two of my favorites danny glover and christopher lloyd also in this movie is ben johnson brenda fricker big tony longo tony danza and matthew mcconaughey also jay o sanders and dermot mulroney the film has great special effects and acting from all of the actors the baseball scenes are all realistic the music by composer randy edelman is very good and it fits the film very well some of the actors who reminded me the actual baseball personalities stoney ray mitchell character reminded me royce clayton character reminded me of steve finley and jay o commentator in my opinion resembled how al hrabosky looks today this is a fantastic movie for non and baseball fans and i strongly recommend this film
this is a very exciting and romantic film i have seen it several times and never get bored with it everything is realistic and it is a good plot the actors are excellent liam neeson jessica lange tim roth and brian actually prefer this film to braveheart as braveheart contain so many historical misstakes there is many exciting scenes watch out for the bridge scen and the last fencing scene this is really good and surprising music are really suits to the movie the setting is amazing
if you have trouble dreaming you may give this movie a low rating but you just have to realize this movie was not made to please people with a sense of those people the movie is great it plays on old science fiction movies and radio shows long gone most of witch where b-rated themselves along the lines of spaceballs and airplane you may need to stretch your imagination a little bit to get the jokes but it is well worth it
modern original romantic good acting of both nicole kidman and ben kidman does a nice job in imitating a russian accent ben chaplin is also good as the shy dull clerk for the men some women miss kidman looks fantastic and is very sympathetic i forgot what a gorgeous woman she is not hard to imagine that john falls in love with her some unexpected turns in the story are good for the suspense although i hoped for a happy ending the last part of the movie was quite a surprise for me good movie pays-bas huit points
the good thing about this movie the concept is interesting and there are some funny scenes it also makes you think of those little things in life that could greatly affect the life of someone else without you ever knowing its a small world and this little movie shows bad are too many characters and its hard to tell who the main character is but its still a great a great movie and many people compare it to magnolia which i haven't would rate it for brief language and sexual situations
this film speaks a universal language one can relate it to the self community society or the wider world it has a way of not only opening up several questions but also setting one in pursuit of discovering and asking the right questions in order to get to that point of self conviction ownership the portrayal of the stereotypes within the film addresses the archetypes around us which must be recognised as being the repeating cycle of destruction the opposing force of innovation creativity and growth the factors which disturb the natural flow of things must be made apparent and tackled the idea is definitely a film to be experienced and not just viewed as it taps into internal voice conscience through the looking it makes one feel as opposed to just watch
this film may seem dated today but remember that it was made in before saturday night live before howard stern back when george carlin was just getting beyond the hippie dippie weatherman and into heavy satiric humor this film is the granddaddy of them all enjoy it for its historical significance as well as for its strong entertainment value
paulie is a fantasy of a littler girl or perhaps her recollection of what her youth was like growing shaloub executes a flawless performance as an russian scientist who cannot find decent work in america he befriends an isolated parrot while performing meanial duties of a janitor at a behavioral science chief doctor is a bitter man as paulie who can speak and fully comprehend language and learn embarasses the doctor who later banishses him to the lower levels of the building where mikail s finds recants his life with marie and how they lost each other the quest begins to reunite paulie with marie only more than years has movie ends some will say predictably with mikail reuniting paulie with marie the story closes with the three entering home where you can make the final your own family film
intimate and specific yes a bit of a cinderella story but only after many convoluted turns earning way deeper and deeper into psyche only superficial viewing can condemn this film as superficial this is the stuff that heals nations this is one of our great national stories path to emotional health encompasses a whole breadth of family history the history of slavery and its aftermath in his first directorial effort first of many i hope denzel washington confirms once again that he has a truly beautiful mind and soul
i haven't seen this in over but i still remember things about film could not have been made in color the stark grays are what make it and was life really that simple in the what stands out the most in my memory is perry smith going to the gallows his breathing under the hood just before they sprung the trap i don't think i could watch that is plenty like that unnamed guy at the beginning of papillon who is dragged out in terror to the guillotine the guy that said watch this on a double bill with dead man walking should have added the last minutes of i want to live as of my ancestors being aristos went to the guillotine in so my feelings on the death penalty are rather intense
this movie was a brilliant concept it was original cleverly written and of high appeal to those of us who aren't really conformist movie pickers don't get me wrong there are some great movies that have wide appeal but when you move into watching a movie based on everyone else is watching it you know you're either a tween or don't really have an opinion this had a lovely subtle humor despite most people probably looking only at the obvious the actors portrayed their characters with aplomb and i thought there was a lot more personal personality in this film has appeal for kids as well as adults esp nice to find a good movie not filled with sexual references and drug innuendos a great film not to be overlooked based on public consumption this one is a must buy
resident veronica is a great well made video has great comfortable great storyline and high fun storyline to this is claire redfield gets taken to an island for trespassing on umbrella reaking havoc at they're main lab while looking for her graphics are very fire and rain effects are great controls are the button pattern doesnt fit the dreamcast it hard to get used still fun going around some wierd disturbing the guts out of also has a little bit of romance between the two main also get to play as chris resident evil sound in this game is better than though i hate the new the giant spiders feet make a disturbing scampering the guns sound alot more realistic sound makes resident evil a definite loved i give it a out of
i liked this tv show because it was own thing a girl who is on her sixteenth birthday finds out that she is a witch and her she lives with her aunties in the house and they are both witches as well well this took her about a few weeks of getting used to when she used her powers for the first time it was so funny because she turned her enemy into a pineapple she had to turn back time and repeat a day this series is really cool and it is a typical teenage series but it wore thin when she moved out of her house and to an apartment with her fellow college friends and then it got boring and i stopped loved her aunties they were so funny and the other one was really ditzy i loved valerie and i hated enemy libby she was ugly
one of the best movies for all ages you will never be able to look at lion king again without thinking of the extra history this movie adds nearly years old i watched this with my wife and two sons after work tonight i have not laughed enjoyed a movie so much in a long time out and watch this with the kids it will remind you of how disney used to be when you were a young one
i've heard people who say this movie is dull dull dull i don't think they were watching the right movie this isn't the prototypical action movie thank is a psychological drama about the rookie and his mentor that just happens to be about killing people in this way it works extremely well with terrific performances from berenger and zane doesn't sleepwalk through the movie like he has in other roles he actually looks like was disappointed with the action towards the end a lot of it didn't make much sense and was unsatisfying given the buildup from the rest of the movie but watch face as he panics alone while berenger does the dirty work
this is a great movie from the lost age of reactionary made-for-television drama my all-time favourite actor robert culp skillfully plots a trajectory through uptight liberal fairmindedness and faith in the system kneejerk conservativism and fear of crime and homicidal psychosis the teens are a collection of pure sneering evil stereotypes and the eventual message of this film makes episodes of dragnet look evenhanded by comparison but what really shines in this is the great pace of the movie building the fear and paranoia by degrees as well as the feel of the whole california setting the cars are really great as well as i recall i give this film a and i defy anyone to watch this film and not enjoy every minute remember just because made-for-television doesn't mean it isn't great art
this is my fourth joe mcdoakes short that i've seen and so far the funniest one in this one joe takes voice lessons from a record impersonating charles boyer and ronald colman when he goes to warner bros studio company behind this series incidentally he asks jack carson for directions which gets both confused then he encounters actor george o'hanlon also mcdoakes who speaks in his more normal voice not too far from his later geroge jetson and gets to the set where he automatically upsets the director i'll stop there and just say how funny i found the whole thing and was fascinated by the movie star cameos provided near the end the final scene was especially a hoot so on that note go to youtube if you want to watch so you want to be in picutres
okay i know i shouldn't like this movie but i do from pat loveable interpretation of a japanese stereotype to jay annoying yell i laughed throughout this long as you take into account that this is not the best movie in the world a good favorite part is morita talking to his boss in tokyo with the drinking a close second
this film is an interesting take on the killer scarecrow genre amazingly it manages to rise to become greater than the sum of its parts average montage scenes playing teenagers and some excellent facial expressions combine to become one of the new-wave of modern classics as a viewer i came away from the film with the same sense of shock and awe as when i first saw the godfather in tiffany startling portrayal of the morally bankrupt judy was deserving of her grammy nomination which was well documentedly stolen by ricky martin and restless hips unfortunately the none of the sequels could live up to the expectation of the original the godfather series which got better with each installment and should culminate in with godfather eat my rage
i've seen this movie at theater when it first came out some years ago and really liked it a lot but i still wanted to see it again this year to check if it is still good compared to movies coming out now and i wan tell one the best movies i've ever seen in my life you need to know is that you don't have to miss any minute of this movie if you don't completely follow the action you will get lost and you will not understand the end end is what makes this movie so good you can't expect to the producer
i bought this a year or more ago for left it on the shelf for ages now watching dvds while holed up with a is a haunting movie brilliant performances by all involved especially the boy the only smiles you get in this reminds me of perhaps my favourite movie ever grosse pointe blank but obviously lighthearted this is heavy a psychologist a clinical and forensic psychologist a shiver went up my spine when the identity of the new contract was revealed scary stuff brilliant work all
people call this a comedy but when i just watched it i once i guess the problem is that i first saw it when i was i wasn't old enough to understand that it wasn't meant to seriously there were quite a few scenes that were be funny but i cared too much about the characters to laugh suggest that you watch this film next time you're falling in try to take it seriously i think you'll find that despite a few one of the most moving love stories you've ever seen
i was going to give it an but since you people made out of a lot better votes i had to up my contribution the river styx was pure genius sure woody was his perennial stuff but at least his role was appropriate the first half hour was really hilarious and then the rest of the movie was easy to watch the dialog was clever enough and card tricks at the parties along with the reaction from the upper crust were fun to watch this was much better than the newspaper critics made it sound out to be and a plus a little apprentice to go along with it and of course did you notice that johansen is getting a bit frumpy charles dance is always entertaining as was hugh jackman
every time this film is on the bbc somebody in the radio times says how it is a satire against the post war world of rationing and the welfare state i do not think this is the point of the film at all the film parodies the time criminals who ran the blackmarket and the housewives league who campaigned against government restrictions but were really a tory front of course the film sends up the situation but in the end the people realise that they need all the controls to ensure a fair want to be british and muddle through rather than i don't think they go back to being exactly like they were before
i've seen a great many films but in cold blood stands alone in a class by itself it excels in every department the fact that it contained few big stars helps push it over the top as you pay closer attention to the characters and their story rather than the name on the marquee blake and wilson turn in stellar performances of the killer duo the fact that much of the films is filmed in the actual locations where the crime took place even inside the very house add additional chills the photography darkens the mood and the photography is magnificent there are many outstanding cinematic works out there but if i could only vote for one to top the list it would most probably be in cold blood
when friendship kills in my opinion is a very touching and kind of heartbreaking drama about the consequences of being anorexic or bulimic anytime lexi wright or jennifer shelton threw up i wanted to vomit myself kind of hard to explain why if you ask me they should have been more cooperative about things however i did enjoy seeing them do things together as well as get lectured by their parents before i wrap this up i'd like to say if you ask me when friendship kills does indeed show you how being anorexic or bulimic can affect a body now in conclusion i recommend this movie to everyone who hasn't seen it you're in for some tears and a good time so the next time on tv kick back with a friend and watch it
textbook example of an underestimated one can watch this movie over and over again and laugh every single time and still see something new in it still regarded as just another funny picture and although the movie has inspired many and added quotes and images to the pyche of all viewers moon over parador still hasn't received the acclaim it should even the brilliant cast with academy award winner richard dreyfuss and raul julia to mention one is not able to change this after watching raul julia as roberto strausmann make richard dreyfus an offer he can't refuse in a meatlocker by reading him a good review of a part that he once played one can only come to one conclusion this stuff is timeless in fifty years we will have the proof
this is my favorite show i think it is utterly brilliant thanks to david chase for bringing this into my the sopranos long denial anger acceptance meadowlands pax soprana down neck the legend of tennessee moltisanti boca a hit is a hit nobody knows anything isabella i dream of jeannie cusamano
i can remember watching this for the first time when i was years old i wanted to be one of the barbarian brothers this movie is still great one original aspect was that the fight scenes where very short implying that the barbarian brothers where so good that they finished there enemies off quickly plus you have chases a cage fight a dragon and yes even a bar brawl the acting is bad so why not a ten also the story line has received a lot of criticism i think it is quite original not to many movies in genre have the same original story lines or colorful dialogue definitely recommend this film
first of all i loved bruce music score very lyrical and this alone added to the charm the best aspect of the movie were the three animals superlatively voiced by michael sally field and the late don ameche whereas fox has the funniest lines ameche plays a rather brooding otherwise engaging voice of reason and field adds wit into a character that is always seen telling chance off the humans weren't as engaging and sometimes the film dragged but that is my only complaint this is one beautiful-looking film with beautiful close up shots of canada i believe although the film itself is quite long there is never a seriously dull moment and this is advantaged by the voice work and a well-written script all in all a charming and perhaps underrated film with a from me bethany cox
far by my most second favourite cartoon spielberg did after animaniacs even if the ratings were low so what i still enjoyed it and loved it was so funny and i adored the cast wow jess harnell and tress macneille were in there and were just fantastic the whole cast were brilliant especially the legendary frank love to see this cartoon again was so awesome and the jokes were brilliant also i can remember the hilarious moment where brain cameos in it you hear his voice and it played the patb theme instrumental that was just fantastic i love it in those cartoons when cameos pop in i wish this cartoon and animaniacs came back i loved them
busy is so amazing i just loved every word she has ever freaks and geeks creek white chicks the smokers after the first time i saw home room i went and got it the next day i am a big fan of her and she has a lot of fans here in israel if someone hasn't saw is excellent movie than don't waist more time and go see it now i recommend to all of you to see all of her movies i saw busy in the late night show with conan and she was so beautiful and cute i just love her everybody who saw the in home room she looks very scary but in real life she is so beautiful you have to see all her half nude pictures for stuff magazine she looks so good there
kurt russell is at his best as the man who lives off his past glories reno hightower robin williams is his polar opposite in a rare low key performance as jack dundee he dropped the big pass in more ways than see some of the most quotable scenes ever put into one film as jack hisses at a rat reno poses and the call of the caribou goes miss this classic that isn't scared to show football in the mud the way it should be played
this movie was very funny i couldn't stop smiling when watching this and have already watched it twice in a period of days the movie is distinctively unique in humor and visuals both are terrific and on par with other serious movie gems cube and cypher i have become a huge vincenzo natali fan ever since watching cypher and everything made is very likable about this movie are the music and loser characters dave and andrew portrayed by david hewlett and andrew miller of the story actors i both like very much also cool are the x-box dead or alive fights even see dave playing halo at a point and amazing guitar solo among many other in all a great feel-good film about friendship you have to see this
two warring shop workers in a leather-goods store turn out to be secret sweethearts as they correspond under box-number aliases within this simple idea and an everyday setting lubitsch produces a rich tapestry of wit drama poignancy and irony that never lets up stewart and sullavan are perfect as the average couple with real emotions and tensions and the rest of the well-developed characters have their own sub-plots and in-jokes although wrongly eclipsed by big films of philadelphia story mr smith this is easily on a par and we enjoy a whole range of acting subtlties unseen in the other films
if you are like me then you will love this great coming of age teen think it is up there with of school all great movies set in the lat early and it has a wonderful as many songs as in some of these type of movies but still is all so very funny at times and has a great love the young cast are wish there were more type of these wonderful favourite movie of all time is back to the future when marty mcfly gos back to well in these wonderful movies it stays in the fab there are some movies of this type better than this but not many
i could see this film is super he didn't surprise to oneself when so that it was taking place for the truth this way by itself how swigged flight to the which didn't have the place but it is only such an conspiratorial theory i liked watching this film when i was the child i am interesting which so that it was if it turned out that such a flight was taking place really certainly to it for not a belief because it is denying logic and the common sense who at healthy senses sent to kids with space shuttle into the orbit i very like reading for the subject american and soviet space programs i know a few missions of space shuttles remained provided by cia with the clause top secret certainly these are only such my divagations but who knows
i love this film the noir imagery combined with no nonsense character mike hammer works marvellously to create a mood and feel seldom found in low budget detective films of the early fifties it may not be the maltese falcon but this film makes own solid contribution to the genre spillane is often criticised for alleged misogyny etc but his dames are way above their male counterparts in terms of cunning and intelligence poor old mike hammer as effectively played by biff elliott is blinded by the beauty of the mysterious psychiatrist whom he meets when investigating the death of an army buddy when the penny finally drops his face is a picture good to see that censorship did not force the film makers to omit the famous last line a bona fide low budget classic
zero day leads you to think even re-think why two men would do what they did commit mutual suicide via slaughtering their classmates it captures what must be beyond a bizarre mode of being for two humans who have decided to withdraw from common civility in order to define their world via coupled is not a perfect movie but given what the filmmaker and actors had it is a remarkable product in terms of explaining the motives and actions of the two young it is better than elephant in terms of being a film that gets under our rationalistic skin it is a far far better film than almost anything you are likely to see but honest with a terrible honesty
rented this one accidentally it was behind the movie box of what i thought i was renting didn't find out until i got home watched it anyways absolutely fantastic a wonderful movie and one of my top three favorite of all time i recommend it to story is enjoyable and easy to follow this could have been easily messed up but the actors and director do a great job of keeping it actors themselves are fantastic displaying wonderful character and doing a terrific job find a copy somewhere
i was totally impressed by shelley waitress this movie only confirms what was clear from that movie adrienne was a marvelously talented writer-director an original and unique artist she managed to show the miseries of everyday life with absurd humor and a real warm optimistic and humanistic tendency ally sheedy steals this movie with a terrific performance as a woman who has fallen over the edge male lead reg rodgers looking like judd nelson is fine there is also a great cameo by ben vereen the song at the end of the movie the bastard song written by adrienne can stand as her optimistic eulogy a world of a sea of matter how much sun you pummeled by the let the heartless get you greet the heartless at your live among the heartless
this movie was beautiful it was full of memorable imagery good acting and touching subject matter it would be very easy to write it off as being too sentimental but that is the sentiments this type of a movie is trying to achieve i was totally involved in the unfolding and presentation there were a few cheesy shots but such is to be expected in a religious propaganda film the only complaint i can conjure is there wasn't a ton of details however this movie wasn't created to explain every element of joseph life ministry triumphs controversies failures etc it was designed for a quick glimpse at a few highlights of one of the most amazing american and historical religious figures of all time
in mexico this movie was aired only in paytv dietrich life is a true example about a good german and specially about a good man the conversations between character and the nazi prosecutor are specially interesting a true ideas war two different germans both with faith in there believes bonhoeffer was a very complex person man freedom fighter boyfriend churchman and a great intellectual ulrich tukur is outstanding as bonhoeffer i recommended this film a lot specially in this difficult times for the planet in mexico we don't know a lot about pastor bonhoeffer life and legacy this is a great work for rescue a forgotten hero
a common plotline in films consists of the main characters leaving the hustle and bustle of the city behind and finding themselves in the tranquility of nature in power of kangwon province we are shown two stories of individuals doing just that trying to find themselves through a trip to the popular korean parks in the mountains of kangwon province however rather than epiphanal moments we have two characters whose trip into nature was just another form of pace of this movie is slow contemplative we learn in the end what really brought each to kangwon province and we learn how they're connected for those who want hollywood glam and for a movie to give them a definitive answer this movie will not satisfy but for those who want a movie that leaves them thinking wondering affecting them years after this movie will more than satiate that longing
a hilarious action comedy in which damian szifron takes into the lives of díaz a cop whose wife has cheated on him he is living in a hotel feeling guilty about his unfaithfulness falling into depression he stops caring running red lights just for fun feeling sorry for himself and silberman a jewish shrink on probation a leftist liberal who does not trust cops at all he is told to accompany díaz in his daily duties unable to refuse due to the terms of his probation soon the situation reverts when silberman himself finds out his wife is cheating on him and ends up being comforted by the very person he was supposed to help a person he did not trust at all in the beginning a nuclear conspiracy car thieves international spies a hysterical wife weird characters in a delightful comedy about friendship and heroism
this movie took the jerry springer approach to super-human power wilder napalm is the kind of theme-based movie that i love addressing the idea that prodigies in america are defined either by their gifts or by attempts to hide them at the same time the movie points out that every prodigy is only human and no more to be feared or worshipped than any other human being this was a great comedy fun and human with that slight satiric edge
i liked this movie sort of reminded me of my marriage it is very clean you can see it with family very nicely done songs are ok too i think the writer director is great the movie shows how marriages progress thru time they have couples at different stages of life and relationships in their life the film beautifully depicts quite a few stages in parallel in the same story some of the dialogs are quite good the movie depicts complex human emotion very nicely not with over dramatization also shows perfect is after all not so perfect shows very nicely the dynamics of arranged marriage when it is new the movie is very well written and directed
one of my favorite movies i saw at preview in seattle tom hulce was amazing with out words could convey his i actually sent mike ferrell some donation money to help the film get distributed it is good system says i need more lines but do not want to give away plot stuff i was in the audience in seattle with hulce and director a writer i think and mike ferrell they talked for about an hour afterwords not really a dry eye in the house why hollywood continues to be stupid i do not know actually i do know it is our fault look what we you get what you pay for guys get this and see it with someone special it is a gem
the alternate title of ecstasy is symphony of love a title which appropriately describes the mood and feel of the film ecstasy is an early talkie and could have very well been a classic film if released during the silent film era this film is a visual treat and is deliberately paced so the viewer can savour its sensuous lyric quality which is presented in an artistic low-key fashion the style is distinctly european the subject matter and approach to sexuality was far more sophisticated than what was being produced in hollywood at that time consider the censorship code in the us during the that pretty much sums it up hedy lamarr one of the great beauties of all time was a perfect choice for this symphony of love
carlos mencia was excellent this is hour special he was working hard to show everybody he was the real deal i know people have said stolen material in this special but that is not true carlos brings comedy up front the way he wants it not how anyone else wants it that is why he is so good people say not funny because he says dee dee dee too much and they still haven't realized thats part of his act and they don't want it that way but he brings it like that anyway and succeeds in making people laugh for all the haters out there here is a message carlos is here to stay you have no point in trying to bring him down
i have to say despite reviews angels in the outfield was a pretty good movie i like the fact how it teaches kids to always have faith and never give up because yes miracles can happen unlike the other baseball movies this one particular movie stood out because of hits amazing special effects and well orchestrated soundtrack which was very interesting though i liked this movie it did have some flaws such as some irrelevancy towards the end when ray mitchell hits a homer he doesn't step on the plate and therefore that wouldn't be a score but just nitpicking i have to say i was really impressed with this presence and moral just have faith don't give up
i was about years old i found out i live miles from the uncle house the uncle house is on westway dr deer park tx they have added homes since the movie was made i don't know the house number but you can go look it up i am now and i enjoy watching this movie the bar on spencer is no longer their pasadena isd wants to build a school their i drove by the house last week the house still looks great my dad and uncle would go to the street where the house is and watch the actors come in and out of the house trying to make the movie where john cross over the railroad cracks they have made higher when i hear about john loesing his son i start thinking about when he made urban cowboy he was or at the time
sogo ishii has taken the old myth of musashibo benkei and stood it on its head to produce a dark gory spellbinding and terrific-looking movie those unfamiliar with the legend won't need to be the story explains itself nicely as it goes along well worth seeking out even though there are no english-language home video versions
a very enjoyable film that features characters who do bad things and who let emotions like anger and a desire for vengeance bubble over the cast is very good plenty of action and stewart gets the girl and his revenge a twist in the end i've seen this film several times and always watch when on amc or cable highly recommended
after being forced to sit through some real stinkers stripes shark boy and lava girl i truly enjoyed watching fried worms for once i did not guess the ending it was funny and entertaining and didn't resort to a ton of gross-out humor despite the title my boys and both loved it too oh and my year old boy had a smile on his face the whole time this is a family movie that is not just tolerable for the parents the relationship with the little brother is so close to real life he is not stopping singing just to annoy me also the way the new kid tries to make friends and how those friendships actually form is right-on with the way kids behave of course the parents have to act a little goofy but my favorite scenes involved the dad getting used to his new job have fun
how can someone not like this movie this movie is so good that the first week i saw it on the shelf at the video store it was horror movie mean he took the carrot and you know is that not funny the only movie that comes close to touching this is bride of chucky and that was just great
this two-parter was excellent the best since the series returned sure bits of the story were pinched from previous films but what tv shows don't do that these days what we got here was a cracking good sci-fi story a great big scary monster imprisoned at the base of a deep pit some superb aliens in the ood the best new aliens the revived series has come up with a set of basically sympathetic and believable human characters with a couple of unnamed expendable security people in true star trek fashion some large-scale philosophical themes loyalty faith etc and some top-drawer special loved every minute of this
i'm not usually a fan of strictly romantic movies but heard this was good i was stunned easily the most romantic thing i've ever seen in my life stunning brilliant sweet funny and full of heart the chemistry is flawless as is the writing and hawke and julie delphy are so natural and sweet together you really think they're a couple movies grabs you right away and doesn't let go you can't look away nor can you stop listening to them even the little moments just melt your heart has jumped into the ranks of one of my favourite ever a masterpiece
stephen king was raised on flicks like this not like this and jeepers creepers are throwbacks to the good ol day drive-in horror flicks they are meant to be fun cheaply made and hopefully a few good looking for a theory on the human condition should pass on this creature feature because all this is all it ever will trashing what has already deemed itself as trash fun you enjoyed this i recommend jeepers creepers jeepers creepers days of night they live planet terror death proof and halloween iii season of the witch
i have no idea what people are complaining about i saw this movie yesterday and i really liked it stone once again delivered a great character she was just as good as she was in the first basic instinct she still has those smart but tricky answers although sharon may be years old she looks amazing i don't care if as fake as a barbie she looks good and that basic instinct gives you everything you want from the first sex violence and a great ending that will leave you thinking and talking about it for hours half the people commenting on this movie haven't even saw it so don't listen to them
i saw this movie when i was and i really liked dana plato who later starred in different strokes as kimberly drummond i don't think garbage it was not meant to be a sequel to the documentary either its just a cute kids movie about children who go after men trying to find the boggy creek monster the men get hurt and the kids rescue them with the help of the creature haunting shots of the arkansas swamp and scenery were neat this is a good movie for kids no real violence a few mild scares but good fun for the young kids
what can one say about a film that has one of the blackest most nihilistic and occasionally most weirdly wont say will say charismatic villains in the history of the cinema and the best sword fight since flynn and fairbanks were in their heyday this is an epic about a stubborn sometimes foolish incredibly courageous and honest mans fight for his honor and freedom against tyranny i loved it john hurt and tim roth were great villains jessica lange was very moving tender and sensual
by no means my favourite austen novel and paltrow is by no means my favourite actress but i found the film almost totally delightful paltrow does a good job and cummings stevenson and the one who plays miss bates are all absolutely terrific the period detail is not alienating the feel of the movie is just right in fact but the real find is jeremy northam as mr knightley there could not be more perfect casting imo i hated mr k in the novel but found him wonderfully human and humane in the film good looks and smiling eyes are no hindrance to enjoyment either highly recommended anar
a woman mujar belengur enters a restaurant one morning at unaware that a terrorist has kidnapped the people in said restaurant is making them act out a musical number in this strange yet fascinating short film which i only saw by finding it on the dvd of the equally fascinating timecrimes it had a fairly catchy song it somehow brought a smile to my face despite the somber overall plot to the short i'm glad that i stumbled across it aware it would be an extra when i rented the dvd and wouldn't hesitate at all to recommend it to all of my grade
another review likened this troupe to a cross between monty python and twin peaks also aptly yet another review expounded on the differences between the comedy we enjoy non-critically and black comedy also well worth the whole thing all three series at the end all the characters are tied up and the puzzle pieces fall into place just as well as a douglas adams novel the detail and intricacies are staggering thoroughly post-modern wickedly funny and startlingly tragic not for kids not for those with thin skins or who lack objectivity thought-provoking at once literal figurative and surreal in disturbing ways the blackest comedy i can very possibly the most wonderful thing i will ever see
i remember seeing this one when i was seven or eight i must have found the characters round because they left a impression in my mind that lasted for a long time after the end of the movie and the ending now sad well for a year old had the opportunity of seeing this movie again lately and found that the plot was too simple the character two-dimensional i guess the kind of movie that you can only with the innocence of a young child recommend this one for all you parents with small kids i saw it in its original french version so i cannot tell you whether the translation is good or not
the only explanation i can muster as to why this film isn't widely distributed is because it hits too close to home for some this movie was a genuine happy surprise the satire is genius this film turns the lights on in the dark that is organized religion and big media and the roaches scurry for cover rent the dvd and watch it for yourself if you haven't yet this film succeeds where many have failed comes to mind to poke nose under the tent both by using humor and very clever analogies coupled with telling backdrops and locations can't comment in depth without revealing some significant spoilers there are some surprises in this film which even the seasoned film buff will be caught off guard by
jim muppets were a favorite of mine since childhood this film makes me feel like a kid again okay the muppets are back with miss piggy and kermit the frog and their friends the premise is that they are trying to get on broadway in a musical show in where else but new york city you will see cameos by the then new york city mayor ed koch anyway the film turns this year and i hope the kids of today will learn to appreciate the lightheartedness of the muppets gang the problem with the show is kermit goes missing and the gang has to find him in new york city worth watching for kids and even sentimental adults like myself
i love this freekin movie walsh is a true master of the cinematic form his film have been sometimes in my opinion overlooked but this film is a favourite of mine because it really gives you the feel of the time the film was set the wonderful characters that existed the lifestyle the mode of dress the way they spoke ok they might be exaggerated but it is good to know that there were occasion when two men tried to outdo each other with insane just felt it was apiece of history thats should be wathced by many people and appreciated because of that i get it somewhere on dvd i have only seen it on tv but for anyone wanting a slice of life movie about that period of time this is the perfect one
christopher lloyd is funny and really believable as al the head angel this movie is much better than the first but it has great special effects that the first did not have as well as a much better plot and it was written for kids but adults have as much fun as the kids do tony danza does a very realistic job in his role but this is not a taxi glover is actually good and even seems to be very human in his emotions as well as showing some real acting talent for a change a pleasant at least once it is worth the effort to catch it
the plot of goodnight mr tom on paper makes it seem we are in for a large dose of director jack gold is an expert on touching the emotions in the right it emerges instead as a moving wartime drama with excellent production and lead of the not the best tv movies of the which possibly would've had even greater success if it had been released in the evacuation of children to countryside towns and villages in world war ii was of course a common in the case of the young boy here was doubly important because of a wretched home life in the horrors of war on the home front are not drifted over the construction of the film until ending leaves us with a sense of optimism despite what has happened is not of comparison with the finale to a wonderful in modern classic
i remember this series so well it was excellent such strong and compelling characters stylish and sexy and so different to everything else on offer at the time and now i am sure that it inspired the also excellent canadian drama traders season and season are available on dvd region in the uk its a treat to watch the series is episodes and season seems to be it seems to have ended after series was a lot of you can get it on special at
probably my all-time favorite movie a story of selflessness sacrifice and dedication to a noble cause but not preachy or boring it just never gets old despite my having seen it some or more times in the last years paul lukas performance brings tears to my eyes and bette davis in one of her very few truly sympathetic roles is a delight the kids are as grandma says more like dressed-up midgets than children but that only makes them more fun to watch and the slow awakening to happening in the world and under her own roof is believable and startling if i had a dozen thumbs they'd all be up for this movie
by five years after this one was released james stewart and anthony mann had completed another six films together four of them westerns their rapport was obvious from the outset and what was intended as little more than a universal progrmmer became both a cult and a classic buffs of the period will revel in the fact that the first ten names on the credits were all more than well known and not counting ray teal or anthony curtis later to become tony perhaps ten years later the psychological western was well entrenched but in it was rare to throw ahab into the mix with cain and abel to say nothing of addressing several other issues along the way and still furnish a conventional western on the surface and full credit to all concerned one to add to the dvd collection
this movie was pretty good the acting was great and there were some really great actors in it like buchholz and roger moore this film is full of surprises confusing at but the twists and turns of the plot always keeps you in suspense the only thing that this movie had too much of was exploding cars
along with partner this is the greatest piece of animation ever created the images and styles are amazing and match perfectly with the story which is a brilliantly realistic reinterpretation of our own world where is has been and where it could go quite affecting and sometimes painful to watch it it a masterpiece of the visual art
lensman is a rather lesser-known anime gem from toho and mk loosely based on the it reminds me more of the game you want to see it in japanese with subtitles or just plain english dubbed version was almost cropped and edited to is not much the fact that the animated feature to combine cg-graphics with hand-drawn fun to
will all of you please lay the hell off todd sheets give you to make a movie and see what you come up with the guy got zombies and a regular cast to work for free sure the acting is laughable at times yes the make-up is not greatest you'll ever see but not the worst either if you want to see that go watch zombie nation with raccoon is pure good old fashioned guerilla film-making todd is a consummate professional and an all around nice guy there are holes in the plot yes the plot does seem far-fetched but what the hell i still love this movie i wish todd sheets would come out of hiding and do the remake of this that he was going to if anyone has ever tried to make a movie they know that just finishing it is an achievement in and of itself
kauffman has made weird metaphysical angst popular but this canadian gem makes it hilarious most weird films the less said about plot the better but set the scene two friends anthony and dave have been together since childhood they can't cope with the world and eventually this means they no longer have to but that is where even more problems loved this film it made me smile long after the final credits and that is a rare experience with so many mass produced pieces of nothing out miss
finally an iranian film that is not made by majidi kiarostami or the makhmalbafs this is a non-documentary an entertaining black comedy with subversive young girls subtly kicking the system in its ass all about football and its funny its really funny the director says the places are real the event is real and so are the characters and the extras this is why i purposely chose not to use professional actors as their presence would have introduced a notion of falseness the non-actors will have you rooting for them straightaway unless a your heart is made of stone b you are blind excellently scripted the film challenges patriarchal authority with an almost absurd freshness it has won the jury grand prize berlin dear reader near-perfect where where can i get hold of it
an excellent film depicting the cross currents in the lives of a multi-ethnic mix of not so ordinary people in the rural pacific northwest solid directing and writing along with fine acting especially the performances by kwami taha and dan stowe interestingly this film was made in the same year as the highly successful crash written and directed by paul haggis the pace of the action may not be as frantic as that in urban los angeles and the characters may seem to be better acquainted with each other in apart from that but the personal relationships of the characters are as flawed and troubled and their stories as resonant as any of those in crash for those viewers who appreciated crash this is a must see film also fans of jim jarmusch and john cassavetes will like this movie
this movie is practically impossible to describe the alternate title don't look up is a lot more descriptive like most japanese cinema the story is not as linear as american the story revolves around a director who is filming a story about a deserter the set is by an actress who during the filming of a tv show back in the the director is the only one who saw this show if you have seen ringu director hideo nakata is the same and liked it you'll like ghost actress i loved ghost actress a lot more than ringu a truly scary and disturbing movie a
this movie was on british tv last night and is wonderful strong women great music of the time and just makes you think we do have stereotypes of what older people ought to do and there are fantastic cameos of the sensible but worried children getting near to my best movie ever
man i loved this movie this really takes me back to when i was a kid these were the days when the teachers still showed classroom films on reel-to-real and if you were good they would rewind the movie slowly so you could watch it play backward i still remember one of the opening was his name and he was an orphan he lived with his sister so and so in the village this is a great movie for kids and as enduring as the red balloon at the end the other indian boys in the village attach the feathers to tutazema and he becomes an eagle himself he gets to live the way he always wanted to he gets to soar the heavens
bill paxton stars in and directs this highly original film having watched the first time i was by how good it was the reviews i had heard were ok as a result i was expecting an average thriller at most however because of paxtons excellent directing and acting the film is well worth watching especially if you are a horror film film is also helped by the plot twists which keep coming until the closing credits the films strongest point is the storyline which i have to say is highly original and is like i have ever seen before well done also to the young leads which perfectly convey the emotions if these confused boys i give this film and i highly recommend that everyone catches it
atlantis is probally the best disney movie that i have seen in years it has great action scene magic an intelligent and weel written script atlantis brings back the magic of the disney classics such as the lion king or alladin after seeing this one i'm sure that this year summer blockbusters season will be recommend to you all alantis the lost empire is like a breath of out of
one of the best low budget movies from germany is this is the dark side of new age if you believe in esoteric please don't watch this movie it blows all your positive fantasies away this movie shows that beyond the peaceful façade of spiritual soul searching lies a world of extreme transgressions and terror i hope there will be a mm copy soon andreas first film is just the beginning of a new area making movies with a few euros i'm waiting for the second hit
this movie scared the crap out of me i have to admit that i spent most of the film watching through my fingers but what i saw was really scary i screamed out loud two or three times during the my favorite aspects were the sound and photography the sound was particularly great and the setting was really creepy beautiful i read somewhere that some weird husband and wife team that made it for some reason that makes this even stranger for me you enjoy the jumps and jitters of scary movies than this one is for you very suspenseful and a great movie to rent with a bunch of friends who love to watch movies curled up on a sofa screaming like little girls
this movie deals with one of the most feared geriatric diseases among the aging today as one who has encountered a number of families who are facing the potential of or who are in the formative stages i would suggest that every health care giver recommend this movie to any family facing the trauma of this disease the movie is designed primarily to speak to the family of the patient and reaches into the very heart of the struggle casting is excellent and the dramatic portrayal is outstanding with a very commanding plot line
seeing as the vote average was pretty low and the fact that the clerk in the video store thought it was just ok i didn't have much expectations when renting this contrary to the above i enjoyed it a lot this is a charming movie it didn't need to grow on me i enjoyed it from the beginning mel brooks gives a great performance as the lead character i think somewhat different from his usual persona in his not a lot of knockout jokes or something like that but there are some rather hilarious scenes and overall this is a very enjoyable and very easy to watch recommended
if i wanted to dribble i'd call a nurse you had enough more than got me a i begin to die please remove cowboy hat from my head that is not the way i wish to be remembered of the wonderfully humorous and often insightful quotations from this charming and often insightful film dudley moore is charming lovable and rich sir john gielgud is aristocratic charming and poor the two have a and son relationship which defines the man whom arthur is to become will he follow his heart and soul or just his wealth over twenty-five years i've returned to this movie with glee and amusement and joy it is a movie to return to time and time again and remember what is important in life as short as it is miller
i found this movie to be very well-paced the premise is quite imaginative and as a viewer i was pulled along as the characters developed the pacing is done very well for those that like to is kept hidden from the viewer early on and questions keep arising which are later answered producing a well-thought out and very satisfying film both cerebrally and from an action seems some people were looking for a non-stop roller-coaster ride with this of those that comes charging out of the gate this would be more analogous to one of those coasters that first takes you slowly up the a wonderful sense of is ultimately in my mind more fulfilling for the foundation initially film
eyeliner was worn nearly years ago in egypt really not that much of a stretch for it to be around in the century i also didn't realize the series flopped there is a second season airing now isn't there it is amazing to me when commentaries are made by those who are either ill-informed or don't watch a show at all it is a waste of space on the boards and of time the first show of the series was maybe a bit painful as the cast began to fall into place but that is to be expected from any show the remainder of the first season is excellent i can hardly wait for the second season to begin in the united states
this film is outstanding and wonderfully scored oscar for music was richly deserved people don't know he won one i think this is one of the best films to watch as a couple late at night on dvd a great surprise prince does a fine job acting and is pretty good at conveying pain on camera morris day wendy and lisa are good in their supporting roles very cool landmark film
what more could anyone want a history lesson foreign language tutor nra representative and ambassador to burundi dressed in a nice silk frock and heels i laughed so hard i left a puddle his woes about puberty transvestism public school and done in several languages made the absolute finest stand-up routine i have ever seen i think about it now years later when i see cake and cake or death and hear something translated into french mouse is under the table the cat is on the chair and the monkey is on the branch i like his versions of what jerry dorsey could have been named before he settled on englebert humperdinck i really hope to see a lot more from this wonderful guy he has a lot to teach us and a wonderful way of telling it thanks for your time
you've never seen anything like it once the coup begins the most dazzling edge-of-your-seat thriller you'll ever see even though you know the outcome and all real because a documentary amazing the time it was over it was on my top list of all time great the slobbering right-wing fanatics everyone i know who has seen this film gives it the rating even if you don't care about politics or about venezuelan politics you will find yourself nerve-racked and believe it on the edge of your a roller-coaster ride
dumbland is not for all in fact dumbland maybe in for nobody except lynch and what make it funny and a collective cartoon violent yes profanity yes absurd yes a piece of garbage never dumbland is a wonderful picture of some americans that don't have brains and hit wife and kids for fun from méxico i can say i love it my favorite episodes are my teeths are bleeding all the noise around and violence make me wanna scream and put me behind my bed get the stick yeah baby get it and learn a lesson some people never be thankful for your actions ants the more lynch episode of all music surrealism and a very sweet revenge
lol delirious was so funny i was in tears eddie murphys impressions are absolutely spot on the best impression was of james brown and mr so funny its weird how eddie murphy was back then and how he is now delirious is a must see but if u don't like foul language don't watch but amazing and so funny i have seen it times and still pee myself every time this is eddie murphy at his prime and you can see where he got the humour and ideas of movies such as nutty professor from he does impressions of his family as well which is real only i was there
as an old white housewife i can still appreciate that laurence fishburne is one of our finest actors anyone who appreciates his work like in deep cover might enjoy watching the incredible acting range of this actor since i think this is his directorial debut it might prove even more interesting all of the acting is quite good if you can't take lower manhattan junky worlds or the reality of crime life glorified action shoot-em ups then this is not a film you would enjoy it is mr usual contribution to incredibly subtle relationships i would love to see larry and anthony hopkins go at each other some day in a movie
would that more romantic comedies were as deftly executed as this one i never thought anything as mundane as the simple sale of a music box could leave me catching my breath with excitement margaret sullavan makes a marvellous saleswoman and she and james stewart always brought out the best in each other this movie sports what i think is frank most winning performance and with the wizard of oz and tortilla flat under his belt that is saying a lot the way he finds a christmas dinner partner left me giddy with joy director ernst lubitsch might have thought trouble in paradise his favorite but this one he must surely consider a triumph with some of the wittiest dialogue american movies of the has to offer
this is a quite slow paced movie slowly building the story of an ex stripper who begins a new family life with a complete stranger the viewer slowly feels that something wrong here really loved this movie even though it leaves a slight bitter taste in the end it is clever well paced and very well acted both philippe toretton and emmannuelle seigner are deeply into their characters little son pierrot is also very thriller which does not seem like one a very unconventional movie very particular atmosphere throughout the whole movie though you might feel awkward a few times with a couple of give it a
i liked this movie a lot it really intrigued me how deanna and alicia became friends over such a tragedy alicia was just a troubled soul and deanna was so happy just to see someone after being shot my only complaint was that in the beginning it was kind of slow and it took awhile to get to the basis of things other than that it was great
if you would like to see a film of different kind if you feel the love in your heart even if you miss the lord this film makes you think although georges is mentally handicapped you can see the ultimate intelligence at the end when love gives you directions not the brain i am not emotional but this film makes you feel the human being the film is as good as forrest gump in my belief the foreign movies are sometimes more interesting yet there is not enough advertisement to make them popular rang-e khoda color of the god by majid majidi is another example of such foreign movies almost with similar taste
or was honest iago actually smirking at the end as he how the iambic pentameter just rolled of tongue with excellent clarity and how branagh made honest iago seem to celebrate his own is a wonderful have often thought that shakespeare is inherently not film-friendly he uses words to create pictures in our minds which creates a perennial battle with the camera which only knows to show us what we need to think and feel every effort to film shakespeare ought really to be celebrated it is not an easy thing to do
this movie had lots of great actors and actresses in it and it addressed some very noble issues full of emotion and the direction is done well the storyline progresses very quickly but i guess better than having to watch a hour movie this is an easy movie to watch again and again and enjoy
it was on at too close to school to see very often the animation computer graphics were spectacular for the time the idea of cowboys ordinary people casually throwing around space vehicles robots was amazing maybe it inspired treasure really boring in the dvd format the shows are all basically identical when viewing non-sequential episodes on a dvd you're stoned by disk by standards the animation is spotty we don't notice the computer graphics anymore and focus on how corny the characters are bright spots are the heroine characters they were a lot more believable took themselves more seriously than modern heroines and weren't corny they actually saved men
jeopardy has the feel of being a stock movie of sorts one of the movies that the studios pumped out inbetween big office ones a mere minutes and doesn't feature many sets and the only star is barbara stanwyck but what a star of course is a tough lady once again as she runs into an escaped convict while seeking help for her trapped husband in the mexican desert the majority of the movie is focused on how she deals with her captor who wants her to submit to him in exchange for his help some psychological battling there a surprisingly effective little movie its short length makes it taut and that stanwyck is great should go without mention i'll still praise her every time
the greatest games of kasparov or fischer can be a mess for a total rookie this is a great movie there is no special agency involved in the plot this is the clue this is a private plot built as a private enterprise this is a self-destructive and a self organized plot as a conclusion the scenario described the perfect professional plot private self self-destructive with no trace at the end anyone can be behind the plot a smart director with some money all can be done just by delegation the director must be just trigger if the normal viewer cannot see the essence of the plot in the explicit sequences of the movie a real plot has fewer chances to be discovered all the actors performances are well done with some special mention for gene hackman and mickey rooney
i was not expecting much from this movie i was given a ticket for an advanced screening i had just gotten off of work it was hot and i was tired i had to wait in the movie line for minutes and there seemed not to be any cool air flowing through the hallways of the theater seated in the theater tired and frustrated the movie started i did not recognize any of the actors in the beginning but the flow of the movie was perfect right from the beginning i became consumed with the movie getting more and more excited with each minute passing i think this movie is destined to be a classic the actors were fabulous the pace was perfect and the ending was magical
more tv movies ought to be made like this one i saw it way back in when it was first on tv helen hunt and steven weber were both terrific giving very gritty and realistic performances weber was especially good turning in an exceptionally creepy and understated performance as the child this film really increased my respect for hunt as an actress the director also directed hoosiers which was somehow both formulaic and exciting but the direction in both of these works has the same stark simple realism that is so appealing if you like tv movies that aren't predictable and filled with overacting see it if you can the side story about hunt and affair is also appealing without detracting from the main story
this is one of the very few movies out there which are very erotic without being pornographic despite there being only a very rudimentary plot not much live sound or dialogue instead the actors do voice-overs describing their experience why they participated a can totally understand why nobody else ever tried to do something like this there already is something like this this the producer doesn't have the rights to distribute a dvd version i've also never seen it being sold anywhere one may email mr boerner and order a copy on vhs
this is a really heart-warming family movie it has absolutely brilliant animal training and acting you can call it like that as well think about the dog in how the grinch stole christmas it was plain bad training the paulie story is extremely well done well reproduced and in general the characters are really elaborated too not more to say except that this is a great ratings story acting cinematography overall rating big family movie and very worth watching
i think that this film was one of kurt russels good movies kurt russel is my favorite actor so i think that he is a good actor in any role he plays but this movie had a lot of action in it and i know that it should have more then a out of on the meter but many people did not like this movie oh well i thought it was good so i think that every one should see this movie if you see this movie and like it i think that you should see back draft also with kurt russel i give soldier out of
i just want to add my two cents worth and forgive me if i am repeating something that has already been posted but i feel it is worth reminding people of the everlovin genius of damon runyon without the wonderfully street hilarious writings of damon runyon this film would never have been made nor most of the other great classics that deal with gamblers the like from before damon runyon worked as a newspaper man and he was from colorado but he sure did the street scene of the east coast if you are not a dedicated fan of old hollywood comedies i would recommend a few other flicks from damon writings the lemondrop kid and little miss marker both feature bob hope who aside from his politics has always been a funny man a west coast liberal i find his politics fairly funny too damon runyon lives
old mannered tale seems very popular these days i have lost count of the number of versions going around probably the reason is that her ruts are our ruts even at this late date this tv mini-series gives it a mannered telling suitable to the novel headstrong opinionated emma is a pretty modern girl when you think about it even though the ambience of jane world may seem a tad artificial to us today if you haven't seem emma i'll only say that self-sufficient emma does get her comeuppance worth watching to find out how the acting honours here go to the ladies kate prunella lucy and samantha they could almost have had a psychic connection to old jane
this was an absolutely spellbinding series and was sorry that i was only able to catch a few shows way back when it aired late night in the uk the style of it was so different from others of its kind and the whole thing had an unnerving air of stylish dread to it all you have to do is read all the positive comments a single negative that i can see to realise what a really innovative series this was and how it caught at the imagination i now understand from reading the comments it got cancelled just so unbelievable what a bunch of headless overpaid suited turkeys there must have been just maybe still are running around to do that
this is not a loose but a precise faithful remake of classic i soliti ignoti with toto mastroianni gassman cardinale etc and the reason is good it copies all the funny characters and the plot even in details the scene where the photographer steals the camera from the local have watched the superb old version many times and i knew by heart all the gangs and the ending but i still enjoyed welcome to collinwood which has its own freshness and atmosphere it is interesting to see how the life and ways of the little thieves in italy are adapted to usa things haven't changed much
the five deadly venoms is a great kung-fu action movie wrapped in a whodunnit mystery there are all the usual telltale signs of a kung-fu flick great choreography awful dubbing different styles of fighting and a wide range of greatly exaggerated often cheesey human emotions however the plot certainly is better than average interesting and holds your attention throughout the non-fight scenes occasionally even able to fire up the audience such as when x character receives horrible thing i love about the five deadly venoms is the beautiful simplicity of the morals and themes just about everyone gets coming to them the cowardly greedy and corrupt lose out the bad guys consumed by selfish greed are ultimately destroyed by their own treachery and backstabbing the good guys use teamwork planning and integrity to overcome the odds and come out on top clan rocks
i happened to see this movie twice or more and found it well made wwii had freshly ended and the so-called cold war was about to begin this movie could therefore be defined as one of the best propaganda patriotic movies preparing americans and secondly people from the still to be formed western nato block of countries to face the next coming menace the movie celebrates the might of the us through the centuries while projecting itself onwards to the then present war which had just ended nice and funny is the way of describing the discovering of the american continent by columbus and pretty the espisode of new amsterdam and the purchasing of manhattan from a drunk local indian must see it least once for curiosity of fashion of propaganda through time
question how do you steal a scene from the expert of expert scene stealers walther mathau in full furious and brilliant grumpy old man mode answer quietly deadpan and with perfect timing as george burns does know nothing of vaudeville but this remains a favourite film the two leads are hilarious the script funny the direction and pacing very fine richard benjamin is very funny as straight man trying to get at burns through the window etc even the small parts are are so many funny scenes mathau messing up the commercial burns repeating his answers as if
the one and only was a great film i had just finished viewing it on encorew on directv i am an independent professional wrestler and i thought this was a good portray of what life is like as a professional wrestler now this film was made years before i was born but i don't think the rigors of professional wrestling traveling has changed all that much sad funny and all around great
this is one excellent sammo hung movie actually this is a great piece of hong kong action cinema the story tells the story of pedicab drivers in macao looking for love and getting mixed up a vicious pimp the performances are excellent and the characters are all likable and well-defined the story is involving and has enough romance drama comedy and suspense to keep one watching between fight scenes sammo hung proves here that probably the best fight choreographer in the business the action is simply amazing esp the fight lau kar leung and the finale billy chow and sammo hung are amazing a must see for any fan of action
i really like dalmations when it came out in now years later i went to see dalmations in i thought it was fantastic but i think is better because i think more funnier more humor and also that movie was based on the same story as the cartoon version hundred and one dalmations i wonder if there are plans for dalmations i hope there is maybe yes maybe no all of us dalmation fans will have to find out if there is going to be dalmations in the future
i had no idea what this movie was until i read about it in the weekly i generally agree with the reviews in the la weekly and decided to get a ticket for this film the film stars molly parker my favorite television show deadwood and lukas haas who i suspect we will be seeing more of in the very near future the film is funny heartwarming features great acting and beautiful photography i don't know if the film has distribution but i hope it does or will soon this is destined to be a real indie gem it even has music by my favorite band the silver jews the only disappointment was that molly parker wasn't there at the screening even without her there this was hands down the best film i saw at the festival
savage raw savagery will scare the hell out of you trust the boy of the estranged savage family is run over by some city slicker tourists pa savage wants revenge and he'll stop at nothing until he gets is a real horror film with some truly wonderful horror the negative review clearly comes from someone who lacks proper knowledge of film the filmmakers chose the lighting and camera-work in order to reflect the dark murky and egdy mood of the story in other words to obtain a certain aesthetic fact the film has won several horror film festival awards
a good picture is worth all the words this film has the most poetic scene ever dreamed of about people with syndrome and i won't spoil it by telling you you'll want to see it duquenne is an amazing actor i did not need to understand a single word he said to understand his film has a magic of own after watching it i understood better that we put too much value on achievement and not enough on the people we love passion and simplicity is all we need
i thought this had the right blend of character plot futuristic stuff and special effects without going over board it will take a while to get going but the acting was good and i was intrigued by the angel who is not to hard to look at i like the attitude too certainly not like other attempts at futuristic stories
for a low budget project the film was a success the story is interesting and the actors were convincing eva longoria who now stars on the tv show dragnet is sexier than ever the locations were ideal for the ganster plot and the director shows his talent by taking on many roles for his project of course this low budget film could use better editing transitions and more special effects for the gun scenes but the music keeps this script moving although this film has share of problems such as continuity i must say that i would rent the next movie if your a film student you could learn a few things from the commentary
i had low expectations for this movie but i was looking for something unchallenging for an evening i walked out of the theatre totally delighted and somewhat surprised this is a very fine baseball tribute film and a nice lesson about pursuing your dreams dennis quaid does a masterful job with his role and i was touched by his performance definitely worth a full price ticket and a couple hours of your time
i had no idea of the facts this film presents as i remember this situation i accepted the information presented then in the media a confused happening around a dubious personality mr chavez the film is a revelation of many realities i wonder if something of this caliber has ever been made i supposed the protagonist was but everyone coming up on important and at the end the reality of that entelechy the people was overwhelming thank you kim bartley and donnacha
rated for violence brief sexual humor and drug content quebec be g canadian home video have seen police story a couple of times my opinion police story is best film from the originally made it because he didn't like the other cop film he had to star in which was the have not seen the protector so i cant acting isn't too bad and the plot is pretty don't remember the plot well because i saw this film a while back but what i do remember is this film has lots of great and comedy just what a good chan film you can find police story and you are chan fan then buy this film
spaced invaders is one of the funniest movies ever seen i understand why this movie get better critics funny harmless and sweet i first watched it when i was and i really fell in love with it days later i got it on vhs till today shown it to many friends and they all liked it but nobody knew the movie before i think the problem nearly nobody knows it so nearly nobody can like it this movie never got a real chance sad si has really the potential of a comedy like monsters inc or spaceballs ok enough displeasure what i really wanted to say is that if you ever want to laugh your head off watch it even if you get mad about it worth watching prepare to laugh earth scum
warning contains a spoiler corny plot and in many cases terrible acting fontaine is great but some others particularly richard ney husband are exceedingly wooden ney lies in bed dying of arsenical poisoning with every hair in place yet the movie is so juicy and so suspenseful more faithful to the book than most movies of its era casting joan fontaine as a poisoner an adulteress which was just as shocking then i'm not kidding kids was a masterful stroke just her usual joan fontainey self as murderers were supposed to she dies by falling feet foremost through the floor into an empty space
anyone who thinks anime is nothing but sex and violence will be silenced forever after watching this movie this is a fine movie that tells about quest to avenge his death but also grows up in the process the journey on the train sort of represents journey from boyhood to manhood the music and visual styles of the movie are a bit dated can tell a movie and the animation is only slightly better than your average star blazers episode but the story and the characters are so strong it really doesn't matter a must-see for any animation fan
i laughed so hard during this movie my face hurt ben affleck was hilarious and reminded me of a pretty boy jack black in this role gandolfini gives his typical a performance the entire cast is funny the story pretty good and the comic moments awesome i went into this movie not expecting much so perhaps that is why i was so surprised to come out of the flick thoroughly pleased and facially exhausted i would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys comedy can identify with loneliness during the holidays putting up with the relatives the best part to this film me anyway were the subtle bits of humor that caught me completely off guard and had me laughing long after the rest of the audience had stopped namely the scene involving the lighting of the christmas tree go see it and have a good laugh
well what can i say this movie really got to me not so bad as many say i really loved it although the idea seems so simple and rather boring it isn't first of all i enjoyed the soundtrack adams it really goes with the movie second the simple story and the drama of spirit gets your attention one thing i like the most is that they didn't give the stallion a human voice to interact with the other horses it makes the movie more realistic not many animations seem realistic now do they but i don't know making animals talk is just so of the most beautiful animations of in my opinion i recommend it to everyone not just the kids because it is very relaxing
moonstruck is one of the best films ever i own that film on dvd the movie deals with a new york widow who falls in love with her aiello angry brother cage who works at a bakery i'm glad cher won an oscar for that movie nicholas cage and danny aiello are great too the direction from norman jewison directed fiddler on the roof is fantastic moonstruck is an excellent movie for everyone to see and laugh a stars
i think that this is possibly the funniest movie i have ever seen robert script is near perfect just check out the quotes section on second thought just rent the dvd since the delivery that really makes the lines field gives a comic over-the-top performance like you've never seen from her anywhere else and kevin kline is effortlessly hilarious robert downey jr is typically brilliant and in a very small role kathy najimy is a riot as the beleaguered costumer i was never much of a fan of elisabeth shue but great here as the one person surrounded by a bevy of cartoon characters on the set of the sun also sets that rumbling you feel beneath you is hemingway rolling over in his grave either that or laughing really stars funny funny funny
i have become quite fond of laurence olivier in the past few weeks and was thrilled when i discovered this gem i have always found it wonderful when i run across a film where i do not have to have my finger on the remote control in case nudity rears its ugly divorce of lady x is charming till the final scene and must have been a true delight for viewers back in i only wish people today could accept and love true humor instead of the horrid trash talk people now call divorce of lady x is well worth time
this is probably the best documentary i have seen in a very long time jonny kennedy was and is still is a tragically beautiful inspiration not only was he a survivor of one of the most painful diseases out there but he used his beauty to show the world that there is life after death and never to give up reaching people and spreading his love watching minutes of his life long struggle was heart-wrenching listening to his smart ass remarks and seeing his adorable gestures was heartwarming and seeing him smile was indescribable i feel blessed to have been able to be touched by this tiny giant please if you ever have a chance to watch this film consider yourself lucky to have met jonny kennedy
dream quest was a surprisingly good movie there were some noticeable goofs but that can be expected in a movie like this that was made in such a short time i did not feel any urge to fast forward during the movie and i found it pretty entertaining it gets kind of silly at times but overall i recommend it they probably used up all the glitter in the nearby stores and some of the costume designs were pretty good
witherspoon has always been very close with her older sister warfield until they both start falling in love with their neighbor london but it is not after a terrible tragedy strikes that the two sisters realize that nothing can keep them apart and that their love for each other will never fade was truly a heartbreaking story about first love probably the most painful story about young love that i have ever seen all the acting is amazing and reese witherspoon gives a great performance in her first movie i would give the man in the moon
ten out of ten stars is no exaggeration this documentary provides the viewers with unique footage about the coup in venezuela this great film is now the minimum knowledge requirement if you want to express a competent opinion about venezuela or hugo dramatic electrified atmosphere the unique footage will allow you to experience a true historic moment you'll feel like you're in the middle of the situation film will help you gain unique insight in the happenings of and will help you hear a side you will rarely hear on tv something you shouldn't miss
one of my favourite domestic movies i don't know if there is any person in our country who hasn't seen this movie funny and sad at some don't know how did people around the world had opportunity to watch it accept this movie because you have to know some moments in our serbian history and character of serbs in the first half of the century to be able to understand it but as i see here there is somebody from canada who watched he liked think that i'll try to put all good quotes from the movie on this site but first to find out how to do
i saw this on cable back in the late as i was a big wrestling fan since i saw this on vhs in a for sale bin and bought i started training as a wrestler after the air force and would always go back to watching this to see how it was a very accurate portrayal of people that are involved with wrestling families and friends that wouldn't understand us the travel the heartbreak etc henry winkler is funny and sometimes sad to watch as nobody else can understand what a genius he is creatively a great way to separate himself the fonz character he played on happy days at the time plus look at the daniels knight rider polly holiday alice and wrestlers roddy piper and chavo guerrero sr if you get a chance watch it
having seen the short a number of times at horror movie marathons i believe it to be a humorous parody that slices to the main point of its the themes are crusty and stale to viewers it is by no means a crumby waste of being a student film gives little rise to an excuse the proof is that it appears crafted with care on a budget of little to no noted by another reviewer it is less than ten minutes which is plenty of time to cleanse the viewing palate with a toast of joy sit back and loaf idly through the think this short-bread of a film should be enjoyed as an appetizer for the title reference and the viewer should relax and roll with it
now days most people don't watch classic movies such as this most of friends only watch movies from the to present thats kinda stingy old movies like this are masterpieces unique in their own way only because back when these movies were being thought of and made thats when ideas were fresh now people strain just to think of new ideas to the movie for true fans of classic horror this is for you the movie is based with a investigator from scotland yard investigating the disappearance of an movie actor and stumbles on to three other strange occurrences with past residents of the same house won't say anymore for i will ruin the movie more than i already have but it is a terrific movie for as old as it is and would never mind watching it again
in all honesty this series is as much a classic television goes as the original poem is to the literature far from being crassly exploitative it is a beautiful and respectful rendering of one of the western defining was moved by the plight of odysseus and his followers touched by the drama of the fall of troy was felt but not seen intrigued by the way the gods played with the fate of mortals should be mentioned that the gods appearing here are not ridiculous cgi creatures flitting around on their ankle wings or poorly-cast fashion models in bikinis as in work they act through mortal agents or rarely are represented by classical a pity not available in dvd especially given the vastly inferior and cheesy adaptations of the odyssey that one can find in video stores
bad script bad direction over the top performances overwrought dialogue what more could you ask for for laughs it just doesn't get any better than this over-acting combined with the cliched scenarios she finds herself in make for an hilarious parody of the hollywood machine almost as funny as spinal tap even though it was clearly not intended as such don't miss ray debut film line looks like a penis
i saw the film for the first time at bbc on july the of for me it was a good interpretation of the person conan i truly wonder what the sherlock fans think about it i also think it is a movie for these fans whether they agree or not what is may ask yourself was doyle a strong person or did he put himself in question however he was the creator of the famous how much of it was a sort of semi-biography not the less i strongly put this adaption forward it is a movie you have to see even if you aren't interested in the sherlock holmes movies or books look a it enjoy yourself and have your own opinion of it
a it is possibly not for camera work acting directing and everything else is unique original superb in every way and very different from the trash we are sadly used to phoenix creates a deep believable and intriguing esther kahn as everything else in this film her acting is unique it is completely her own neither british nor american nor anything else i have ever seen there is something mesmerizing about lengthy unbroken natural shots are wonderful reminding us that we have become too accustomed to a few restricted ways of shooting and editing
cannot believe a movie that can be made that good in and is virtually unknown in the west not to repeat other reviews here the score is very good and moving literally it means dawn please never comes when it comes the beautiful ghost and the lover will be apart forever after years joel and leslie still look great i enjoyed joel in god of gamblers and many movies by leslie including better tomorrow
what is so taboo about love people seem to have major problems with the title of this movie didn't catch my eye it was a grainy shot about minutes into the movie is what made me stop channel surfing i could not believe how freaking amazing this film was it touches on so many levels of human emotion that it did not once fail to move me in some way it is by far one of the best independent films i have ever seen i did not view these characters as either gender just human i would recommend it to anyone who loves movies especially independent films praise to all fearless filmmakers
not many reviews hence thought i would add not go by the other reviews this was a excellent is one of the very few indian directors that can actually put together a really good and akshay given yet another example of great acting as does bhoomika too which was a little unexpected but great to surprised there has not been much hype around awards nominations considering how good the movie then khakee i thought and i thought khakkee too was good a fairly long movie but definitely worth it and while watching it definitely does seem wait for rks next movie and the next ab akshay movie they always seem to do well together too has acted really well in the movie and should do really well if she continue in the same fashion in the future
i've watched this documentary twice and although i'm an major movie buff most documentaries don't hold my attention this film however was mesmerizing almost every shot is perfect saying so much more than an audio commentary this documentary does not concept of this film is amazing i can't praise it enough mardi gras beads who would have thought and excellent choices of interviews film footage of a factory in china the film makes you feel like you are actually political aware and i've read several books on globalization so there wasn't anything in this film that was a surprise to me however made me think so much wish so much too that this world was a better million kudos to the filmmaker and thanks for making this film wish everyone could see it
a most awaited film of the year after three and half years of has acted in this movie the hype for this film was toooooo is not a typical rajini film in this film he gives some spiritual messages also but it also includes typical rajini etc its a good entertaining movie and gives good messages will rate this movie as good instead of excellent because of the screenplay its a must watch movie dont miss it
i love monte carlo and thoroughly enjoyed this movie i thought everyone was very good i was not familiar with richard lewis i thought he made his character peters very personable funny and attractive sean young was very good as the befuddled rejected girl with a heart of gold george hamilton was charming and the perfect italian gigolo john candy has a field day as the bon vivant james belushi is hysterical as a total jerk cybill shepard gave a very sweet performance as a nice vulnerable ignored housewife delightful ensemble cast lots of talent clever script lots going on and beautiful locations just a nice pick me up for a dreary day especially in the winter when a trip to europe is not anywhere on your horizon
i'm not sure if this is some kind of masterpiece or just sleazy fluff elevated by the performances and visuals whatever the case i'm sure i loved it from the wonderfully twisted lurid intertwining stories to the deliciously sinister performances from robert stack and dorothy malone to the vivid gaudy colour with which all captured this is high-class trash and great fun not to mention the amusingly sly and thinly veiled sexual subtexts which permeate the entire film always threatening to escape from the image into the dialogue but never doing so i'd be lying if i said that the sheer entertainment value didn't contribute to my love for it but some sort of bizarre artistry behind the unintentional was it comedy and i really really dug that i could really get into this melodrama stuff
i ran across this movie on the tv and could not turn it off peter sellers plays an unlikable fellow who falls for an extremely warm and cute goldie hawn wouldn't the way that character holds herself from the beginning of the movie to the end is untraditional even today this movie gave me a different angle into human relations and also i found it very funny peter sellers role was a difficult sell but i think he pulls it off well
as a study of the frailties of human nature in the context of old age this film is without parallel it is quite simply brilliant full marks to everyone from the scriptwriter to all involved in the finished product you can only marvel at the perceptions inherent in the characterisation of the two ageing performers
halloween is a film i have to get out and watch every time that day of the even watch it sometimes when not the film is so lee curtis is an actress i can never stop movie might be the story line still gets me right there every the acting was absolutely i have not seen the feel already that it was totally think rob zombie should have never remade such a kills me to know that there are some people out there who have seen the remake without even hearing of the am getting furious just thinking about movie was it will always be remembered in history as a classic
debut film this italian noir is generally credited with launching the neorealist it says so right on the back of the is a sometimes penetrating sometimes lugubrious portrait of lonesome individuals in moral flux set in fascist italy an assortment of supporting an ingenuous drifter who espouses communist the remote desperations of a country searching for its identity from without drifting phantasms longing for a soul although compassion for the disenfranchised and his ability to express their lamentable conditions was already well-developed the spider web of deceit is a staple of noir is to posit a protagonist manipulated by fate and the femme fatale gino here is so unhinged to begin with that you fear he might deserve cosmic irony too didactic the illicit relationship strained with bathos all the same incisive and essential although its actual impact on film history is certainly debatable
i've just watch films of pang brothers the eye and one take only when i watched the eye i was kind of disappointed about this two guys who i had heard good words about them before that film eye has a really bad script especially the ending and too coincident in my opinion but its still good in photography and experimental images so i decided to see one take only and i didn't disappointed again still great photography stunning image mtv-style editing cool music and this story has a lot of indie and beautiful you'll see some tiny plot holes but it doesn't cause any trouble with the storyline the only problem about this film is i get a bad dvd
you can call it a mystery perhaps a small thriller or an intelligent story takes you through the life of one person who has lost his life and is looking to regain have to say i was quite surprised that i truly did enjoy this film it is not usually the genre i care for however the characters quickly became people to me and i wanted to know what they were about and what was going to happen to like many french films over english made we are able to learn much more about the character and the affect of their surroundings on their person this film is character driven and will not disappoint
saw this movie when it came out in left a lasting impression great group of actors a little short timewise but a great movie all the same have only seen once since then and that was some time ago hopefully they'll put it out on dvd if they haven't already
this was a typical grade b movie in hollywood and yet it succeeded way beyond its expectations why it has a wonderful plot and backed up by nina foch george macready and dame may witty as a female villain of all a young lady answers an advertisement for a secretary she certainly gets more than she bargained for the only talents her employers are seeking are those which will lead to her demise seems that witty and macready want to pass her off as their daughter-in-law and wife respectively macready killed his real wife and wants to do foch in as well so that a body can be film deals with how foch tries to get town people to believe her and how she is thwarted in practically everything she does why don't people believe her
a group of friends decide to take a camping trip into the desert-and find themselves stalked and murdered by a mysterious killer in a black pick-up is obviously inspired by duel and the hills have this slasher yarn offers plenty of nasty violence and gory highlight is a sequence involving a man having his arm and leg chained together around a tree and then having his limbs dismembered when the chain is pulled by a is also a little bit of suspense and some exciting stalk-and-slash acting is pretty lame and the script is quite the film is fast-paced and who plays the villain is fairly desert locations provide some atmosphere and the gore is rather you like low-budget horror films give this one a out of
this movie was very enjoyable though you'll only like it if you hate going to the dentist but aren't afraid of a movie where one of them goes beserk you love horror particularly liked the fact that some care was given to explaining the brute actions of the main character the fact that totally obsessed by cleanliness in the mouth and then catches his wives providing some oral pleasure to the mud-covered pool-man is a pretty believable reason to go it i give it an
reese witherspoon first outing on the big screen was a memorable one she appears like a fresh scrubbed face tween slight and stringy but undeniably have always liked her as an actor and had no idea she started this young with her career go figure i actually gained some respect for reese to know who she was so early on i say that because whenever i have watched her perform the characters thus far in each portrayal she also seemed to have her own persona that lived with that character quite nicely in my first film experience with reese was the little red riding hood parody reese did with kiefer sutherland somehow i assumed that was her first time up at bat not so well done reese
an excellent interpretation of jim novel this neo-noir thriller has all the requisite ex-boxer turned drifter alcoholic widow with sinister desires ex-cop turned small-time crook and a kidnap plot destined for doom yet the film never crosses into cliche country but remains fresh and intriguing the performances are all superb particularly bruce role as the wicked sleazeball uncle bud there is a tense uncertainty to the movement which intentional or not adds to the grim proceedings highly recommended

and this is a very disturbing film i may be wrong but this is the last film where i considered burt reynolds an actual actor who transformed the role and delivered a voight and ned beatty are also excellent they are unassuming and unaware businessmen wanting to enjoy the country little did they know what would happen photography and sets are realistic and natural this was before the days of wes is most disturbing about this film is the fact that places like this still exist in america country folk still detest city people it is almost a century and a half since the civil will enjoy this film it was filmed in the rural sections of south georgia which still exist just don't drive past that to mobile alabama that area still has not been repaired since hurricane katrina
vanilla sky was a wonderfully thought out movie or rather abre los ojos was well thought out i watched that movie late one night excited about what was to come i wasn't disappointed by the end of the movie i was awstruck i couldn't get it off my mind the whole idea of it just blew me away the ending was more of a surprise than shyamalan could ever do the plot line was also something that kept me interesting through and through the cast superb it was an all around wonderful movie the kind of movie you can watch again and again and always find something new i've seen it four or five times and i'm always finding something new a movie to keep you interested forever
superman and the mole men is quite possibly toughest adventures lane and clark kent are sent to silsby home of the deepest oil well while there some radioactive mole men come up through the oil well and explore the town jeff corey and many other townspeople try to dispose of the invading mole men can superman change the ways in time to save the mole men can superman warn the people in time about the radioactive danger the mole men my opinion superman and the mole men is a very intelligent well-written and well-acted movie even though we only get to see superman fly once briefly it still makes a great superman adventure a must see for stars
as a lover of the surreal art and film i was pleased to discover this film on ifc it is definitely a keeper most of the other reviews tell the general plot all correct so i won't bother to bore anyone with that the main thing is the alternate worlds concept which is brought on by impending illness and the way she manages to link with someone else after being so alone and finally with her family which i believe is still at least a little troubled it only can be called a horror movie in that it has frightening scenes but is a fantasy a little hint of coming of age only because ana is a pre-teen who hates boys i heartily recommend it to those who appreciate the stretch of their imagination
as usual hollywood stereotyped everyone in the movie but this one is a classic from the uptight white collar banker to the russian woman well done even facial expressions were great language was perfect in russian language and nicole did a splendid job hey guys you get what you pay for
i love this show as it action packed with adventure love and intrigue well some times love so good see a show where all the characters work well together and they treat each other with respect also very good to se dick van dyke in a television role as i have only seen him in mary poppins the mixture of the main characters mark amanda jesse and steve is very capturing to the audience this is a show you have to watch
girlfight follows a project dwelling new york high school girl from a sense of futility into the world of amateur boxing where she finds self esteem purpose and much more although the film is not about boxing boxing is all about the film so much so you can almost smell the sweat technically and artistically a good shoot with an sense of honesty and reality about it girlfight is no chick flick and no rocky it is rather a very human drama which even viewers who don't know boxing will be able to connect with
hi i consider just cause one of my favorite sean movies it is a tense psychological thriller with excellent performances from the cast especially also has one of the best lines i have seen in movies so the dialog is pretty good in this one it also has one of the best scenes in movies ever when sean interviews ed character in prison is just enjoyed this one a lot and i can not recommend this enough really do not miss this one do not pay attention to the negative reviews stating that the last minutes suck it was as intense as the rest of the movie i really find just cause a very entertaining movie
this has got to be a unique twists of two genres of ever seen the giant monster movie genre with the living mummy movie genre this unique blend makes for a unique and compelling story the casts is outstanding including tom bosley who as far as i know never has been in a horror movie before ever the effects are impressive and the idea of a giant mummy filled with smaller mummies is a cool one my one complaint i just wish we saw more of the giant mummy but other then that i think they did a great job the dialog the characters and the story was perfect the acting was wonderful this has got to be the best movie to come out of the sci-fi channel you heard me the best movie to come out of the sci-fi channel i give the fallen ones out of
with all of the violence on tv and in the local news it is refreshing to have a show that has no violence or adult language yet is still entertaining my children look forward to watching with us every week each of us have a favorite chef and favorite judges we all enjoy elton brown we enjoy learning about the background of the main ingredient unique vegetables and seasonings we play along at home to guess who the winner will is a great hour of entertainment as well as informational best of all in our hussle bussle life it is an hour the family spends together
the most hillarious and funny brooks movie i ever seen i can watch and re-watch the tape times i laugh my off and i cry on some moments it is really good and funny movie and if you like brooks this is a must in short brooks gets to the streets as homeless for days in order to win the entire poor district from his competitor the reality bites but in the end it is about warm relations between humans hightly recommend
a tragically wonderful movie brings us to a japan that does not exist anymore despite technical expertise i have yet to see a movie that can match the authenticity of the atmosphere in this small town by the river near the sea tom the last samurai looked liked the last installment of the lord of the rings in trying to capture rural old you like serene but intense story lines this is a must see film it will be a respite from hollow flashy films much like the last blockbusters you saw i think this is one of better if a movie about geishas and brothels and the complicated rules that govern life in such settings it did not turn into a skin flick the characters are full of depth and act with much intensity
terrific film with a slightly slow start give it a chance to get cooking story builds in interest and complexity characters and story line subvert expectation and cliche at all the right moments superb new york city locations gritty real are a fantastic antidote to the commercial imperatives of sex in the city in fact the entire film is an antidote to the notion of new york city sex and relationships a rare film that treats its characters so honestly and compassionately loved it great cast with notable performances by steve buscemi rosario dawson and her love interest his name
i thoroughly enjoyed this true to form take on the dick tracy persona this is a well done product that used modern technology to craft a imagery filled comic era story if you are a fan of or recently watched some of the old dick tracy movies then you're sure to get a kick out of this rendition the pastel colors and larger than life characters rendered in a painstakingly authentic take on an era gone by is entertainment as meant to be i personally find musical element to be a major part of this film-the cd featuring her music from this movie is one i've listened to often over the years just so well done and performed musically and tuned to that era in my mind finest moment both on-screen but especially musically this is sure to bring out the kid in you
spoilers classic sex trash the swedish gal was what made this movie so great she was beautiful but what really got to me was how sexual she was she exuded massive quantities of sexuality throughout the film her best scenes were when she was er stimulating herself whenever she was on screen i became the doctor julia of the dimwitted male focus of the film was very interesting visually although most year old girls have bigger breasts than julia she knew how to use what little she had and her scenes the scenes with the silk blouse and black skirt also grabbed my attention unmercilessly you also got to love the major hoaky scene where the bats stripped her nekkid i don't know if i've ever seen anything more ludicrous yet sexy at the same time classic stuff
i have always been a fan of the show so i'll admit that i am biased when the run ended i felt like too many questions remained unanswered this movie to me felt like closure to see all the people i'd followed over the past few years together at last was most rewarding i have heard that this is probably the only homicide movie that we can expect if that is so this is the appropriate way to go out this movie is sometimes poignant sometimes upsetting but always satisfying if you are or ever have been a fan of the show watch this movie
when philo vance lowe is standing precariously on the edge of a balcony high above the city apparently hypnotized and just about to step to his immediately reminded me of a nearly identical scene in another film made nine years later the woman in green in which sherlock holmes similarly about to hurl himself into space while being hypnotized both philo vance and sherlock holmes survive these attempts at murder by unscrupulous criminals exciting cinematic suspense in both these scenes when will they learn you can't cloud the minds of great fictional detectives
i think this has the potential of being the best star trek series yet i say potential we all know there is a chance they will drop the ball and run out of ideas but i hope not for those that have not seen it without that annoying prime directive floating over their heads every time they encounter races it could be cool and scott bakula was without a doubt a great choice for captain and the vulcan babe is hot too out the decontamination gave this a full it blows away all the other series openers i hope this goes longer than years
the fourth in the dirty harry series this film features one of the most despicable ugliest unlikable profane disgusting females i have ever seen on film ray perkins played by audrie neenan she is the modern nasty low-life version of the detour character ann foul mouth and gutter attitude turned me off so much i never watched this film again until i acquired a profanity filter which shut her least some of her then i could enjoy the rest of the harry callahan eastwood goes violence immediately minutes it happens so often almost laughable but it makes for a fast-moving entertaining film with a satisfying ending as all the scumbag villains are eliminated is a very sophomoric film that appeals to our base connects sad to say most of us like to see these dirtballs get it in the end and who does it better than dirty harry
it was such a treat when this show was on because it was such a fresh innovative and original show this makes every show i've ever watched look plain boring the moment the first episode aired i was entranced and i became attached to all the characters so easy usually never happens because i always hate a few characters it is a pity this show won't have a third season because it has to be one of the best shows i have ever seen and that isn't exaggerating my feelings for the show at all nothing can ever replace pushing daisies because what could abc possibly find to replace this show this is easily the best show on television came for kristin chenoweth and i stayed because i fell in love with the entire show
this film was seen by my wife and i when it came out in it was a revelation to us we actually thought that we were the only gay and lesbian couple who had ever married and had children obviously we were wrong love may come from where you don't expect it and maybe don't want it but we both chose that love no it never changed our sexual orientation that kind of stuff is for the christian we were young we both had affairs but never with the opposite sex as we aged we stopped having extramarital story is not far fetched however the suggestion that they became heterosexuals seems pretty unrealistic to me my wife and i have been sleeping together for the last years we are still gay end of story
i just came back from hong kong on my summer vacation and saw the legend of zu i thought it kicked it was so creative and unique the crouching tiger hidden dragon with a lot less drama even if some thought there was too much special right you can't complain about the cast zhang ziyi and cecilia cheung are so fine the legend of
before he became defined as nick charles in the thin man series william powell played another urbane detective named philo vance the supporting cast is strong in this early talkie and star quality is evident mary astor who eight years later would be defined by her portrayal of brigid does a good job here as the featured woman who finds herself in the middle of it all
it is very rare for a film to appeal to viewers of all children for a fine narrative and a wonderful colorful production and to adults for a literate script fine production values good all bound together with a fine rozsa score two roughly contemporary films accomplish of baghdad and the adventures of robin hood some of the back story on this production is fascinating this production commenced in england in the summer of moved to hollywood and proved a cover for british intelligence efforts the producer alexander korda was subsequently knighted in here is a unique case of the intersection of art commerce and politics by all means secure a good cd of this film for your library
a delightfully unpretentious send up of romeo and juliet approach with no expectations other than having a good time and you will enjoy this one a talented group of comic actors let go and have a riot in this light-hearted performers vehicle bad reviews were due to a snobbishness about treatments of shakespeare some people feel that all film must be important you share those views don't bother the credits read introducing angelina jolie which is not even close to being true but she is astoundingly beautiful as the juliet character and as always her acting is and considering her age at the time even her dialect is pretty good recreating this classic tale with feuding italian families in the catering business in new york results in great fun see it in the right frame of mind and you will laugh out loud
how tasty was my little frenchman tells a story that is alternately sad scary and life-affirming it ends with a brutal finale that you knew had to happen even though you were even this is the greatest strength it expertly plays with your emotions and expectations then drops a bomb on saw this in a film theory class at usc back in the it is not easy to find but is definitely worth hunting for
i saw this on tv so long ago that i can't remember when it was but it still stands out as one of the scariest most unnerving films i've ever seen there is a simultaneously subtle but intense dread induced by the woman in black lurking at the edge of the frame not quite clearly visible so that you feel the solicitor hero unsure whether its just imagination or not it is also one of the few films which has really made me fearful to keep watching production values be hanged good films are about a ability to create atmosphere using film actors music attention to detail and imagination a real gem
ella was excellent franchot was unavoidably over-the-top he played similar parts in other films such as the man on the eiffel tower and alan was nearly non-existent but the film certainly spoiler i wonder how many times elisha cook got strangled in his films but i seem to recall various other examples i will avoid naming the murderer but i think necessarily obvious because of the plot thriller very well-done but dated film noire example everyone smoked like crazy and the police were really stock characters and no dead bodies were ever shown unlike gore fests done in the familiar short-scene tableaux format of the out of
this is a wonderful film first impressions of cynicism and crassness are soon dissipated by a fun loving display of how men and baser motivations diverge la difference can love people despite and sometimes because of their weaknesses human beings are a bit rubbish really but we have big hearts and we try our best despite temptation not our fault when sometimes temptation can't be resisted just who we is a consistent stylishness from start to finish crisp photography and sharp composition very pleasant viewing when you add provocative content well suited music and laugh out loud out for the very young lone wise voice brilliant wisdom from innocence balancing comedy from the human condition
this has the funnist jokes out of all the cheech chong flicks the first one i saw with these guys i found it to be really good my dad actually recommended me to get it what a great role model and my grandma actually bought it for me knowing what it was like what a family i have well this movie is pretty good and great to rent when you want to see a good classic i must warn you though this isn't gut-busting funny it has its moments but not as funny as something about mary check it out anyway i'm sure you'll laugh unless your an anti-drug activist or something
i just saw the drugs years on and i love it i think it reflects the drug history very well and most importantly it has a strong message to the all generations there is woodstock there are and jim deaths there are many many examples of drug use and drug abuse it completely cover the time line and evolution of drug use in america in both good and bad ways in my opinion this documentary is well done and i would like to congratulate to its creators because this is exactly what is needed to be playing in the tv in these days i am waiting for the dvd release you should definitely see it this movie is big time
cosby in my opinion is a must-see cbs hit i'm not sure if i've never seen every episode but i still enjoyed it hard to say which one is my favorite also i really loved the theme song if you ask me even though i liked everyone it would have been nice if madeline kahn hadn't passed away during the run since that happened i've always wondered what the show would have been like everyone always gave a good performance the production design was spectacular the costumes were well-designed and the writing was always very strong in conclusion even though it can be seen on tbs now i strongly recommend you catch it just in case it goes off the air for good
i love this film the songs and story lines are great fun and the song saying goodbye always moves me what a brilliant thing to do to bring puppets to life in a way that you actually care about these things made of cloth and fabric and whatever great voices and great talent why were all the other muppet films that came after this one so much less interesting moving and funny is it that mr henson is just so very missed
another very good mann flick thanks to the combination of walter brennan and jimmy stewart brennan tatum is often the comedic conscience of either stewart or wayne rio bravo there to see that the younger man takes the ride fork or bend you're wrong mr dunston jeff gives off the impression he cares only for himself but it is clear he cannot desert brennan john mcintire is excellent as the law of skagway with due respect for the trappings of justice over the reality of it another key theme is helping people and in turn being helped by people the loner can do neither and suffers for caption above plays on assertion that he can't live without his coffee this nicotine addiction proves fatal probably the first and last time on the recommend this film and now own the dvd
the film belongs to inventor underdog genre jake gyllenhaal laura dern and chris cooper bring a little acting verve to story with several standard elements well filmed well edited with plenty of well acted secondary have declared this movie to be classic american hokey it is that and more i agree with those who say the movie celebrates the thrill of youthful inspiration film is a pleasant reminder that achievement may be born of ordinary
this is the best movie i've ever seen because i live just a few miles from the village were the story take place and i know how things work out in this area in sweden the movie tells the truth believe me it both criticizes and honors the lifestyle of dalarna and the producer wants people who watch the movie to be more opened minded and care more for your closest friends and if you live in another small village anywhere in sweden another country you will probably also recognize much from this you maria blom
night of the living homeless is a funny spoof of the the remake of dawn of the this the episode has homeless people all coming to south park and the people cannot figure out treat the homeless like zombies who want change and a few of the parents end up on the roof of a supermarket like in the now up to the boys to find out where they came from and how to get rid of is a fairly funny episode with some good moments like the boys singing their own version of the song california a good
this indie film looks at the lives of a group of people taking an adult swim class in connecticut the plot is fairly thin what drives the film is the characters excellently played by mostly unknown actors standouts in the cast are brewster as a high school teacher experiencing marital problems and weixler as a casino dealer who moonlights as a stripper the two actresses give natural performances and work well together this is an impressive feature film debut for writer schechter and director setton the latter keeps the narrative moving at a fast clip the film title and poster suggest something raunchy but this is a marvelous little comedy-drama
i really liked this movie kurt manages to act without speaking letting moments speak for themselves he doesn't have to verbalize or rationalize his actions he simply decides and takes action he is supported by a good cast of actors and settings and is able to show us a more humane side of soldiers without getting to corny
this is a better adaptation of the book than the one with paltrow i liked that one too it isn't so much that beckinsale is better they are both very good but that the screenplay is better davies is a master at adapting austen for filming and the production values here are very good not quite as glossy as the hollywood treatment but close and i thought that the locations and the costumes actually worked better
his choice of films the basic conceit of the production places him in the sets or simulacra of the films he is commenting on and his delivery are brilliant but if you want freud be aware that you're getting version of lacan which should not be confused with lacan himself as usual zizek delivers complex ideas with gusto and in a convincing manner the rub is he is also quite mercurial and so there may be more in his gusto than in actual content cinematically it is a gem psychologically this will have people of all persuasions lacanians and jungians scratching their heads but reaching for the popcorn all the same zizek is a phenomenon and pop icon unto himself
i am completely shocked that this show had been only lasted one just recently started watching it and i love a show that could of gone as far as friends had the humour and was extremely is about brothers and sisters living under one roof without their lawrence plays the part of the oldest sibling and takes on the more fatherly should of lasted much more than year as it was fantastic amazing show with all the best
silly hilarious tragic sad group of down-and-outs team up with a seasoned crook to elevate themselves out of their poverty great you ignore the screwup to see george clooney doing something genuinely funny for a change the casting is perfect and the acting standards very high although it could be said that the motley crew subject isn't new i think this movie handles it in an interesting and unique way sufficiently so that it stands out from what has gone well done guys
this is an entertaining look at the gospel as presented by johnny cash in black of course who sings a lot and narrates a bit also if you like johnny cash this film is quite enjoyable also note the blonde depiction of jesus in this for fun try to think of five jewish men who have blonde hair anyway its a fun presentation of the greatest and most important story of all
i just finished watching this film and found it very enjoyable it is a quiet little film that doesn't overwhelm you with special effects or big performances it simply takes you into the lives of the people living in a small hamlet in the backwoods of north carolina thomas gives a good performance as raymond toker a young loner who finds a baby abandoned in the woods search for the parents takes him on a journey that will have a profound impact on his life david srathairn plays truman lester a slimy conman with an ulterior motive and david plays the bad guy to perfection is much more to this film than first meets the eye filmed on location in north carolina and with a wonderful sound track of traditional music it is worth watching
embarrassingly i just watched this movie for the first time years after its release a story that any father or brother can relate to one brother is a bit wild the other brother is the typical older child craig sheffer is a little too unemotional as the oldest brother but pitt is amazing and skerritt is perfectly cast as the father the fishing scenes that were filmed in montana are absolutely breathtaking i had no idea that fly fishing could be so attractive the movie closely follows the book with only a few modifications to make it more appropriate for a movie format unlike most book to movie stories this one measures up a perfect movie for anyone who wants a quiet night with a powerful and somewhat emotional movie
i picked this film up based on the plot summary and critics quotes on the back of the box i'm not big into foreign films and didn't know what to expect i don't really care for subtitles either but i absolutely loved it it has a simple lovable quality that leaves you feeling good about life i found myself laughing out loud repeatedly i'd recommend this picture to anyone even those who abhor foreign films with subtitles this one makes it worth the effort
i really like star trek hidden frontier it is an excellent fan fiction film series and i cant wait to see more i have only started watching this film series last week and i just cannot get enough of it i have already recommended it too other people to watch since it is well worth the view i have already watched each episode many times over and am waiting to see more episodes come out i rated it a ten but i think it deserves a loll my compliments to the staff of the star trek hidden frontiers on an excellent job if u like star trek i highly recommend checking out this star trek fan fiction film the detail associated with this series of films is excellent especially the ships and planets used in it
in brooklyn a century ago the rivalry between chuck connors and steve brodie and their competing volunteer fire brigades leads to famous bet that he can jump off the brooklyn bridge this is a story which will be familiar to a lot of people through a bugs bunny spoof bowery bugs from generally very enjoyable film would probably be more widely available if it were not for the notorious and unsettling scene involving some chinese tenement dwellers a time capsule of antediluvian racial attitudes giving the film a great deal of historical interest in my view
if any show in the last ten years deserves a it is this rare gem it allows us to escape back to a time when things were simpler and more fun filled with heart and laughs this show keeps you laughing through the three decades of difference the furniture was ugly the clothes were colorful and the even the drugs were tolerable the hair was feathered the music was accompanied by roller-skates and in the words of merle haggard a joint was a bad place to be take a trip back to the greatest time in american history fall in love with characters and the feel good essence of the small town where people were nicer to each other this classic is on television as much as full house don't miss it and always remember to shake your groove thing
this is a very real and funny movie about a japanese man having a mid-life crisis in japan ballroom dancing is not approved of but when shohei sugiyama becomes obsessed with meeting the beautiful young girl he sees in the window of a dance studio he suddenly finds himself enrolled in dance classes no one is more surprised when he begins to like it than he but he must keep his secret pleasure from his coworkers and family when the truth comes out it is quite funny
a pre-code stunner with stanwyck playing a speakeasy whore who sleeps her way to the top these pre-code flicks really let it all go with nothing left to the imagination stanwyck is outstanding as lilly the daughter of a speakeasy who sold more than booze to his the old man barb heads for the big city for better uses her female attributes to sleep her way to the top john wayne makes a poor cameo and proves that actors get better with age and an acting coach i loved the banter and strong lines between the actors i highly recommend this film to all film buffs and to watch stanwyck who is great and beautiful as lilly
as a popular sport surfing was liked by many people just after watched the documentary i realized how dangerous it could be in fact the surfers also scared of big waves even somebody got killed by it but they still kept on surfing and enjoyed themselves only brave people can do to what the surfers said we can clearly knew what they felt when the big wave came at them you have to adjust to your best and avoid direct strike from the big wave when you win it that will obviously bring you huge amazing cinematography cannot be overlooked that is absolutely visual excellent sports documentary
don't be swayed by the naysayers this is a wonderfully spooky film this was a thesis project for the jt petty he did a great job of having me on the edge of my seat i never really knew what to expect and for a jaded horror-movie goer this is nirvana the film concerns an elderly man who lives in a isolated log cabin in the woods one day while searching for his cat in the woods he witnesses the murder of a child or does he he agonizes about this the rest of the film what is most unusual about this film is that here is no dialogue until the last few scenes i found this to be intriguing the writer manages to get hold of your senses and gives them a relentless tug give this film a go you won't be disappointed
michelle rodriguez plays diana a high school girl with an insolent scowl and x on her shoulder ready to battle anyone especially her father who is paying for her boxing lessons diana decides boxing would be a good way of focusing her liked the relationship between diana and adrian santiago douglas as adrian is excellent watch how their emotions towards each other are shaped by the squared circle
reign over me after the who song is a movie that is sure to bring a tear to almost eye it was a moving story of a guy that lost his family in the world trade center attacks years later he runs into an old college roommate that he doesn't even recognize due to the post-dramatic stress ensued by the loss of his family the two rekindle their old friendship and character johnson realizes that he must get character fineman some help before too was the first movie that has made me cry in a long time completely worth watching and after seeing it i'm positive the viewer will appreciate his or her family much more
this little film had long been on my keeper list do people realize how stressed out menopausal emotionally abused women well as the mentally retarded were really treated by the medical profession at the turn of the century all of the pious uptight christian attitudes of that time were deadly to exploring true emotional feelings that would allow us to embrace suffering souls let alone explore what it means to embrace our humanity can you really imagine standards that walt books were banned because he acknowledged women as having feelings and emotional responses as great as a mans think about that the sensitivity of this movie still gets me and i give credit to the director for capturing this through his eyes
this is a really nice and sweet movie that the entire family can enjoy about two dogs and a cat who are taken away to live with someone else for a little while but the animals don't understand and they escape and go to find the family on their own the cat is named sassy and she lives up to her name chance is the younger dog who knows a lot about life on the inside of the pound shadow is the older and wiser dog who senses things put those three together on an adventure and it makes for a happy and fun filled time there are no special effects of the mouths moving so it isn't cheesy at all the best talking animal movie that i've seen so far a really good movie for families
i enjoyed this film it was a joy to see a version so close to the vision of peter number of people have disliked the film but it has to be seen in context of the origin story that it is the film uses flashback to show the young modesty and the events that shaped her into the woman that she became before the network before willie pace is a trifle slow and for my taste not enough tension is developed in the present day scenes however this is acceptable just to get such a faithful you like modesty blaise you will enjoy it even with its faults if you just want an action flick with car chases forget has the feeling of being the first of a franchise but as i have never seen it promoted anywhere i suspect there will be no more to follow sadly
this version of anna christie is in german greta garbo again plays anna christie but all of the other characters have different actors from the english version both were filmed back to back because garbo had such a following in germany garbo herself supposedly favored her anna christie in this version over the english version a good tale and a must-see for garbo fans
this was the worst movie i've ever seen yet it was also the best movie sci fi original are supposed to be bad what makes them fun the line i like my dinosaur meat well done is probably the best quote ever also the plot sounds like something out of a pot induced dream i can imagine it now the writers waking up after a long night of getting high and playing dance dance revolution then putting ideas together for this space marines got to alien planet which is infested with dinosaurs and has medieval houses in it to protect a science team studying the planet best idea ever in fact in fits the complete sci fi original movie checklist guns dinosaurs medieval times space travel terrible go watch this movie but don't buy it
atlantis was much better than i had anticipated in some ways it had a better story than come of the other films aimed at a higher age although this film did demand a soid attention span at times it was a great film for all ages i noticed some of the younger audience expected a comedy but got an adventure i think everyone is tired of an endless parade of extreme parodies a lot of these kids have seen nothing but parodies after a short time everyone seemed very intensely watching atlantis
i usually steer clear of tv movies because of the many ways you know that tv movies five seconds into the picture this one got my attention because of the unusual title and its gloomy well-crafted mood that is established from the very start while the ever present rain confirmed my suspicions of a misplaced story if claiming to be set in california the movie was largely shot around a stormy vancouver the dark and oppressive outdoors beautifully complement olmos excellent acting
a must see film with great dialogues great music great acting and a superb the film you will follow people for one day in the city of antwerp they are all individuals and sometimes plain weird how i love not going to say anything else just go see and enjoy it
during the whole pirates of the caribbean trilogy craze paramount pictures really dropped the ball in restoring this anthony quinn directed cecil b demille supervised movie and getting it on dvd and blu ray with all the extras included it is obvious to me that paramount pictures execs are blind as bats and ignorant of the fact that they have a really good pirate movie in their vault about a real pirate who actually lived in new orleans louisiana which would have helped make the crescent city once again famous for pirate connections when the execs at paramount finally get with the program and release this movie in digital format then i will be a happy camper paramount pictures it is up to you to get off your duff and get this film restored now
having the opportunity to watch some of the filming in the slavic village-broadway area i couldn't wait to see final this film at the cleveland premier last haven't laughed out loud at a comedy in a long time it is great slapstick the russo brothers did a fine job directing the entire cast performs their best comedic acting no slow or dry segments george clooney is one of my favorite actors and great as the crippled safe breaker in this flick i was most imprest by william h macy as crook riley and michael as toto they keep you in stitches i believe they have the funniest roles in the entire movie
ok you want to test somebody on how comfortable they are with their adolescence and the embarrassing and maniacal changes therin then get their immediate reaction from watching this uproarious doc about kids making socially relevant horror flicks in the suburban more than any movie i has ever seen the film deals with burdening sexuality and ego in a way that is completely human never dull and flushed in the kind of inherent goodness of youth that is discolored by the fear-frenzied adult world where any quirk in youth is accredited to anything from insanity to perversion mini-mogul darren stien seems to be reaching for a deeper understanding of his triumphs and misgivings as the patriarch of strict world what he finds in himself and others isn't always pretty but shows how one can improve and reconcile with age what does change mean without reflection i love this movie
this was a marvelously funny comedy with a great cast john ritter and katey sagal were perfectly cast as the parents and the kids were great too kaley cuoco was a good choice to play bridget who was sort of a toned-down version of kelly bundy from married with children the writing and performances were both john ritter died during the series and it put a damper on things they had to scramble to change the show and bring in more cast members and it was obviously an uncomfortable situation but they handled it well james garner was a good addition it could have lasted longer had ritter especially loved it when they brought in ed o'neill in a guest spot that was out of
this is not a bad movie it follows the new conventions of modern horror that is the movie within a movie the well known actress running for her life in the first scene this movie takes the old convention of a psycho killer on he loose and manage to do something new and interesting with it it is also always nice to see molly ringwald back for the this might be an example of what the genre has become cut hits all the marks and is actually scary in some parts i liked it i gave it an eight
i found it highly interesting that the film actually managed to bridge the gap between my own american culture and that of the originators chinese it becomes a story about values and causes the watcher to reevaluate their own choices in life and loyalties toward institutions amazingly enough it managed to do this in a gentle mildly humorous manner which only in retrospect seens threatening to status quo i enjoyed the movie and would watch it again if i could
i don't care if you'd like my comment or no but i think that you who write that the movie isn't so obsessed by the films of hollywood that you can't see how good is this movie i'm not a fan of jay chou but i like his play and not only his and may be you think that there is not a big sense in the idea and may be you think not so interesting but look deeply there is more than action in the movies more than love and passion and tears there is more than usa in the world and good really good and it cost a lot to do it so please don't criticize the actors the directors cause you don't know how hard they work for you to be happy in this hour and a half watching them thank you
terry stunning feature-length adaptation of chris short film la jetee is full of mind-bending surprises yet still touches your heart thanks to the superb cast flair for the phantasmagorical works with the script by david and janet peoples to play with your head as much as it does with poor james cole at his most steve mcqueen-like better than mcqueen even a time-traveling convict from the future who literally doesn't know whether coming or going as a team of scientists keeps sending him back to the wrong eras while trying to prevent a plague deadly to humans but harmless to animals willis the justifiably oscar-nominated brad pitt and madeline stowe as a well-meaning psychiatrist give some of the best performances of their careers even paul tango-style score is haunting this a don't-miss
brendan filone is the absolute best character in the sopranos he died by getting shot in the eye this was the best and well orchestrated scene ever in the sopranos brendan filone is too good brendan filone shall haunt uncle junior in his dreams until uncle junior can't take it anymore brendan filone is the best character brendan filone was killed in episode denial anger acceptance but his legacy will live on forever brendan filone is the best character on sopranos brendan filone is the best character ever i recommend this show to anyone who likes drama and wants to see good death scenes and great directing and producing because it doesn't get any better than this series brendan filone is the best
one of the finest musicals made one that is timeless and is worth seeing time and again delicious the acting especially by ron moody as fagin is superb costumes are the shabby two young lads who play oliver and the artful dodger are wonderfully talented oliver reed does a great job portraying bill sykes to where you can't help but hope he comes to a terrible he does dancing is cleverly choreographed and is mesmerizing oliver can hold its own with the likes of my fair lady the sound of music oklahoma etc a film for the entire family
scarlett johansson woody allen hugh jackman ian mcshane romola garia directed by woody allen just after his work with johansson on match point the two return for scoop a corky zany and fun comic ride when a student reporter finds out a new scoop from a deceased reporter when she enters the materializer of a lame magician the scoop being of the new tarot card killer in london who might be preppy peter lyman while sondra and sid are playing detective sondra falls in love for the handsome would be killer allen has finally hit a mark not as good as match point but definitely more fun i laughed a lot more than i expected one of the years must sees
this is a brilliant documentary that follows the life of herge and his creating tintin its based around a series of interviews conducted in and covers every thing from his early life and nazi collaboration to the final moments of his edited very cinematic and fast paced enough to not get boring this film will give you a new appreciation for the work of film makers make the film more than just another documentary using the latest state of the art technology and for a change putting it to good more and more documentaries have been making it to cinemas but this one as to be amongst the best
these things have been floating around in my head for damn near years now some pieces of this work were really memorable id love to see another more current example of cg showy offy stuff actually i'd love to be part of i'd would of had the chance to just say what i wanted and thats it i wouldn't have to write all this extra in order to make lines if text as this website requires i mean really this almost discourages me i mean luckily for the guys that made the movie i really liked the minds eye and it took me times to have enough lines i hope you don't get me on the misspelling yup you did
i consider this film to be the best one about mike hammer with biff performance the definitive mike hammer harry script is excellent and contains many improvements on mickey novel his direction is strong and imaginative and he makes fine use of light and shadow the camera work by john alton is top-notch as is the score by franz waxman the cast includes many veteran players as well as peggie castle in her memorable performance as charlotte manning all in all this is one of the finest private eye films ever made biff elliott and haary essex should have received more opportunities i have always treasured this film
i enjoyed it in general i'm not a fan of comedies and comedians but i do like whoopi i'm also partial to fantasy and the dinosaur craze i read for pleasure but when i'm feeling over-stressed or really mind-dead i watch tv movies to escape theodore rex enabled me to do so that makes it a success in my eyes i didn't even walk away to do something else while it was running whether or not it was rated as good or not doesn't really matter to me and no i'm not a juvenile nor am i a moron
this film is an hour or so of good entertainment and has some genuinely funny moments i loved the character of matt and also tiny they seemed the most engaging and funny characters and certainly the most interesting matt is very good is his no good cousin and the police woman and the blonde biker woman provide some welcome eye candy i must say i saw striking similarities between matt and another aussie actor eric bana my personal favourite part was the brothel scene loved that overall i liked the film and it'll get about an rating the penalty however i was disappointed in it was a side foot curl rather than the appropriate laces am of course kidding
as perhaps one of the few canadians who did not read the book in high school i thought i would add my comments seeing the movie without knowing the story beforehand in no way detracted from the film the characters have so many complexities everyone can relate to them in their own way the brilliance of the adaptation is that everyone is allowed to project their own perceptions onto the lives of the characters rather than being spoon-fed an opinion you can love them or dislike them and still feel the emotional impact of the movie wonderful performances by ellen burstyn and christine horne really bring the characters to life i'd highly recommend it
a wonderful surprise of the spanish cinema i never thought jordi molla could be such a great director after all i really don't care much for his choice in movies however this film was absolutely fantastic and not predictable at all something i always enjoy it hasn't enjoyed much good press and i really don't think it'll ever be released in the us market we'll have to content ourselves with the dvd or vhs if even that i don't want to say much about the story because i don't want to spoil it for you but basically the movie is about a homeless drunk who becomes the new messiah just for kicks and to get some money out of it sooooooooooo many before he knows it he is immerse in a life he was not counting on
with the mixed reviews this got i wasn't expecting too much and was pleasantly surprised a very entertaining small crime film with interesting characters excellent portrayals writing breezy without being glib and a good pace it looks good too in a funky way apparently people either like this movie or just hate it and i'm one who liked it
i really enjoyed this movie it succeeded in doing something that few movies do now it provided family values while entertaining me nancy drew is a heroine for all generations and a role model for young girls to look up to the little girls i was with throughly enjoyed the movie and kept talking about nancy as we walked out of the theater the movie has relatively few problems for families and i don't think parents will get bored sitting in the theater no it won't win an oscar and it did not showcase magnificent special effects or even provide a horribly spooky mystery but it entertained me and it stood true to the the spirit of the books i would definitely recommend this movie to anybody with a young girl will love it or any fan of the books you will not be disappointed
sure this movie is not historically accurate but it is great entertainment most demille pictures especially the later epics are slow and plodding but the action here moves at a clip the story is basically a series of peaks with very little quiet moments the action takes us from an indian raid on a cabin one of the best parts of the movie with jean arthur excellent while attempting to appease the war-painted natives this is followed by her and cooper being taken to the war camp and being tortured later comes a protracted battle with the cheyenne the whole thing is ridiculous but great fun and entertaining from start to finish jean arthur is one of the best actresses of this era and she shines here
i gave it an only because it had received such low votes this is definitely really about a ummm it was kind of bloody had likeable shallow characters and it had some really hot babes in it i like the eclectic killer because he didn't kill people the same way everytime that sometimes gets old
the ultimate homage to a great film film is a masterpiece of poetry on the great poetry it is fact all the norms for movie-making are perfectly chosen to suit the message of the muslim society in india has never been presented with such and script is memorable in the hands of etc to name a i was most impressed by the regal looking kamal master movie maker kamal lasting legacy to the very beautiful film on a controversial theme that makes humanity look up and face the reality of the outcasts in the ka naam pakeeza haan acting is unheard of in this age of and pornography
kolchak is sheer entertainment great stories and a great cast and nothing else to weigh it down darren mcgavin gives an energetic performance that pulls the audience along with him simon oakland jack grinnage and ruth mcdevitt give mcgavin the kind of solid support that most leading actors can only dream of having some excellent guest stars add colour and verve to individual episodes erik estrada in legacy of terror phil silvers in horror in the heights antonio fargas in the zombie easy to see how a boyhood spent watching kolchak drove chris carter to create the x files darren rip simon rip ruth rip
yowsa if you really want some action check out the babes and bombs on this non-stop thriller veteran star martin sheen leads a trio of supermodels on a mission to stop nuclear terrorism but director dean hamilton doesn't let this heavy plotline get in the way of massive doses of teensy-swimsuit scenes jiggly beach jogs hubba-hubba hot tubs and the like want action you'll get more of it here than in pearl harbor want babes you'll get an eyeful every two minutes want more go out and buy this video yowsa yowsa yowsa some mighty spicy meatballs
this chinese movie made me feel so many similarities with members of a culture i don't belong and are far from in an almost buddhist approach the film helps one to relate to each character and to the happiness of doing the simple routine all actors are brilliant and xu hzu exudes kindness and wisdom yet also vulnerable and mean er min the retarded brother shows us that intelligence and wisdom are not equal and that wisdom comes to and from the most disparate persons in this universe a different china this is far from the chinese realism yet it has lots of humanity and realism of a different it you won't be disappointed
just after the war this story was made in order to highlight anglo-american relations after the war it ended up receiving the honour of being the first royal premiere after the film tangles together the royal air force sigmund freud psychology the founding fathers of america and various others up the long stairs effects in its infancy and beyond the heavenly gates without losing any of its integrity sounding absurd this clever script leads and dances the viewer between heaven and earth with the skill of a mountain goat and a presents a charming ease rarely matched in cinema since prepared to have your heart warmed by this sweet innocent and charming love story roger livesey acts like a man possessed to steal the show cinema should cry when it remembers how good it used to be in those early post war
sophmoric this film is but it is funny as all get out it shows the boys locker room mentality being played by the other side it is good to see such tides turned and how silly they are but probably not news to most women cause ask one they've heard em all it with a small group or party of mixed gender and of the room will laugh for hours straight and the other you ever really please them
the symbolic use of objects form editing the position of characters in the scene these were all used with such joyous abandon by hitchcock that you can really see what a fertile genius he had the way the wife moves from one corner of the ring to the other as the fight progresses the editing when the wedding ring is placed on her finger while these may seem a bit obvious by todays standards in the silent era they spoke volumes about the story without a word being spoken even the title has a least four meanings that i can see the boxing ring the wedding ring the bracelet the lover buys and the love triangle at the heart of the story
i always enjoy seeing movies that make you think and don't just drip-feed the answers to their audience revolver is one of these films and although many reviewers have stated that it is difficult to follow with a bit of concentration and an open mind i got it first time true it doesn't compare to other mind-mucks like the usual suspects or memento but in its own right its an intelligent and thought-provoking film thing i really liked about this film is how damn beautiful it is every scene every camera angle seems to have been thought about for ages if you see it you'll know what i to conclude watch it with an open mind and you may enjoy it if not well no-one ever said revolver is for everyone and my cents
this movie i have been dying to see well it took till now to decide to actually rent it it was completely worth it this movie made me laugh from the beginning to the end chris rock is funny no matter which movie he is in however this should come real close to being his greatest if ur lookin for a family movie ie pre-teens and up then this is one u can't pass over
red skelton was still another major star who made the transition from movies to television with shows certainly brought a laughter to the american households of years would begin the show with an opening monologue afterwards we would have a variety of characters remember gertrude and heathcliff in the monologue how can we ever forget san fernando red i remember one episode where as a king red introduced his queen by referring to her as your know that red would use his comedic talents to really hide from his tragic life he lost a son to leukemia at age or so his wife georgia died by suicide
what a night perry mason then have gun will travel followed by gunsmoke it was a half hour and finally at came sea hunt with its wonderful opening theme music and boat sailing off to a new adventure terrific regardless of the story it was the lead character by lloyd bridges strong honest sincere a man and a man this brought on an interest in boats that lasted for years why they don't show on cable or make it available on video no idea too bad
this movie was not so much promoted here in though it got good actors great script and rather good photograph was not a so called blockbuster movie in my country the movie itself is very about the hard time that a newcomer had to go through when he returns in his home-village after been released from a prison the end is rather sad mourikis is trying to keep up with his part and he handles it pretty well lambropoulou is great and very sexy in a strange way and of course hatzisavvas is for one more time close to excellency out of because very few greek movies can make such an impression
letters with no destination end up in another world found in the back rooms of the post office here alice manages to land a job in hope of finding her lost father what she does discover is the tormented soul of her boss frank a quiet little aussie flic that came and went at the cinema now you find it in the deep dark corner of the video shop overshadowed by fifty copies of that dreaded godzilla film a shame because this turned out to be a satisfying film telling a brave tale with strong simple images and effective performances from the two leads this film succeeds where garry other dead letter office flic dear god usa failed and comes close to the brilliance of not the kevin costner turkey but he postman china
i enjoyed the cinematographic recreation of china in the in this beautiful film the story is simple an older male performer wants to pass on his art to a young man although he has no living children the faces of the actors are marvelous to see the story reveals the devotion and gratitude of children to those who treat them well and their longing to be treated well the operas in the film remind me of farewell my concubine which was more sophisticated and intricate the story here reminds me of a dickens tale of days when children were almost chattel the plot is a bit predictable and a bit too sentimental for me but well worth the time to view for the heroism humanity and history portrayed
this is a great movie most of us have seen jurassic park where the chaos theory is summarized by telling about a wings causing a tornado on the other side of the planet well bug is all about that at least something don't worry this is no spoiler i'm definitely not a religious type and don't believe in pre-destined stuff fate etc but this movie surely makes you wonder if coincidence really more the acting and camera are excellent too another prove that still possible to make a good movie without a zillion bucks
to get in touch with the beauty of this film pay close attention to the sound track not only the music but the way all sounds help to weave the imagery how beautifully the opening scene leading to the expulsion of gino establishes the theme of moral ambiguity note the way music introduces the characters as we are led inside marriage don't expect to find much here of the political life of italy in not what this is about on the other hand if you are susceptible to the music of images and sounds you will be led into a word that reaches beyond neo-realism by the end of the film we there are moments antonioni-like landscape that has more to do with the inner life of the characters than with real places this is one of my favorite visconti films
with a special telescope dr janos rukh karloff successfully proves that years ago a meteorite landed in africa containing an unknown but extremely powerful element dr lugosi form an expedition led by rukh to locate the element unexpectedly rukh discovers radium x even more powerful than radium and very radioactive and karloff becomes contaminated and can kill anyone by just touching them the sparks really fly between lugosi and karloff in this classic science-fiction film during the post-world war ii era director hillyer used a few standing sets from flash gordon series which was being filmed at the same time and also inserted some footage of electrical machines from frankenstein universal kept the public unaware of the special effects being used in this great classic film karloff and lugosi were at their very best and they both enjoyed working together and will be enjoyed by future generations
bromwell high is a cartoon comedy it ran at the same time as some other programs about school life such as teachers my years in the teaching profession lead me to believe that bromwell satire is much closer to reality than is teachers the scramble to survive financially the insightful students who can see right through their pathetic teachers pomp the pettiness of the whole situation all remind me of the schools i knew and their students when i saw the episode in which a student repeatedly tried to burn down the school i immediately recalled at high a classic line inspector i'm here to sack one of your teachers student welcome to bromwell high i expect that many adults of my age think that bromwell high is far fetched what a pity that it isn't
although not the best anime i have ever seen but i enjoyed lady have never read the comic book and just saw this at the video store and decided to give it a animation was ok i got the sense of the anime from it which is what set it off for me why everyone else hates that is beyond development was fine i like how they brought the transition from hope to lady death around for you who don't like it obviously wasn't paying attention lucifer tells you how it happens and she used his was a nice for her his dark bruiting style was perfect for this kind of think everyone here who has bashed this needs to take another look at it and reconsider cause everything people have bashed this can be said about everyones favorite anime vampire hunter d
i admit i had some trepidation when i first saw the previews for this film was treading on hollow ground here i mean harris and quinn don't really look or even sound like john or paul but i have to admit this film really surprised me far from the exploitation film i expected instead a character study a low-key whimsical and ultimately bittersweet look at friendship and the ultimate lesson we all learn hard if not impossible to capture what we once had and what has passed us by
i saw this as a child in the late eighties and i must say galaxy express is one of those films that sticks in your imagination for a long time if you've never understood the appeal of anime discovering this film may be your golden ticket to story is as delicate and poetic as ridley blade runner the cell animation while somewhat traditional possesses a vivid style that explosively portrays leiji great talent for character design and visual is one of those unique films like star wars the dark crystal and the wizard of oz that completely transcends family entertainment status and stands as a classic of cinema on its own highly recommend this film
telemundo should definitely consider making a dvd collection of the novela xica i know tons of people including myself who would like to be able to purchase the novela xica it is a very entertaining novela which is set in brazil the costumes worn by the actors are beautiful and the town in which the novela takes place is beautiful xica contains a lot of history of that time period i wish telemundo would televise it again even if it was a in the morning i would highly recommend watching xica if it is ever shown again on telemundo i've e-mailed telemundo a million times already to show the novela again but my pleas have fallen on deaf ears the only cautionary statement about xica is that it occasionally contains some harsh scenes therefore i would recommend that children under do not watch xica overall xica merits a out of
one of my all time favourite films ever just beautiful full of human emotion wit humour intelligence the story grows as does the lesson of life just a wonderful film in so many cast are also fantasic a great selection of the finest british talent around i loved them all for every diverse element brought into the has to be one of the most romantic places to form a story such as this everything about this film i love it
this movie is about a side of ireland that americans don't normally see the narrow-minded religiously prejudiced side of the friendliest race in the world the movie by the admission of the inhabitants of fethard who are old enough to remember the events is fairly accurate they insist that the film-makers invented some of the more violent scenes just to spice up the movie was very unpopular in ireland as it portrayed the catholic church in a bad light but the simple fact is that representatives of the catholic church organise vetoes of minorities protestants it was the film is a fascinating insight into the whole issue of religion in ireland
crush examines female friendship for the most part avoiding the saccharine quality which spoils so many films with the same theme g steel magnolias at the same time it reveals the power of a sudden passion to overwhelm and surprise the events depicted were highly improbable but the underlying emotional truth seemed very genuine to me not a film for the speeding-vehicle-and-explosion crowd but grown-up women are certain to respond with both laughter and tears
the rookie kept me smiling from beginning to end dennis quaid played the role to perfection the little boy that plays his son was fantastic he made this a father-son movie to remember the messages are good ones follow your dreams failing at the pursuit is alright as long as you try the excitement is palpable i believe this movie will be a classic
this documentary was nominated for an oscar and easy to see why even years later it is quite an impressive piece of work why it isn't in-print is a mystery that only disney can explain good use of live footage and animation in tandem this used to run as part of vault disney every few months or so but i haven't seen it listed in quite a while most recommended
i thought it was one of the best sequels i have seen in a while sometimes i felt as though i would just want someone to die killing off of the annoying characters was brilliant it was such a well done movie that you were happy when so and so died my only problem was in some scenes it looked like someone with a home camera was filming it and it was weird judd nelson is cute at least in my opinion and he was excellent in the role as stanley caldwell brilliant movie

this movie is the only movie to feature a scene in which michael jackson wields a tommy gun plain and movie rocks because it is freaking hilarious it may be creepy to see jacko little kids but this movie also stars wait for about it joe pesci and jacko with tommy guns throwing coins into jukeboxes from feet away whats not to like as stated before this movie rocks
and my children love it now granted i can watch it now and realize the animation wasn't that great and that the plot is trite hey if every villian introduced themselves by saying i ammmmm daaaarrrkk heeeeaaarrt i think they might be laughed at but for young children it is a moral story with catchy so catchy mind you that i still had the words memorized after not seeing this film in twenty years i would definitely suggest this one for younger children
in a performance both volatile and graceful al pacino re-teams with sea of love director harold new york mayor john pappas in city savvy thriller thats the first film ever shot inside the lower manhattan structure ground zero for the the other nyc locations provide the vivid settings as an idealistic mayoral aide cusack follows a trail of subversion and cover-up that may loop back to the man he serves and fonda danny aiello martin landau tony franciosa and david paymer add more starry brilliance to this gripping tale of the power behind power

diane keaton gave an outstanding performance in this rather sad but funny story which involved quite a few young people and their deep dark secrets diane family who had an only daughter and loved her beyond words can describe she always called her and told her surrender dorothy which was an expression used in the wizard of a sudden car accident occurs and natalie gets herself deeply involved with her friends and lovers as natalie investigates the more truths she finds out about herself and her real relationship with her daughter great film to view and enjoy especially all the good acting from all the supporting actors
this is an entertaining movie actually might make you uncomfortable since it isn't some undead psychopath or sociopath its your everyday doctor how scary is that got some good actors and actresses in this movie though some where unappreciated like virginya keehne as sarah ken foree who you might recognize from rob devils rejects and co-stars as our detective on schizoid dr alan short little summary is this dr alan feinstone a guy who has a sexy wife nice house and is a great dentist everyone loves until he catches his wife cheating on him with the pool cleaner then he starts having hallucinations that his patients teeth are all rotted and that the female patients are his wife as he starts going nuts in this thriller but before that nice guy
i thought the children in the show did a very good job i especially enjoyed the performance of the emma character well done the stunts were pretty good for a low budget show i was able to follow the movie and enjoy it without having to look at my watch every enjoyed the scenes with the tooth fairy and the burning of her the ghostly apparitions of the souls being released was also good another good point of the movie is that it kept moving along there wasn't a lot of slow scenes the adult leads were also believable and therefore helped to keep the show entertaining all in all an enjoyable night of movie watching
i'm a fan of tv movies in general and this was one of the good ones the cast performances throughout were pretty solid and there were twists i didn't see coming before each commercial to me it was kind of like medium meets anyone else think that in certain lights the daughter looked like a young nicole kidman are they related in any way i'd definitely watch it agin or rent it if it ever comes to was great haven't seen in her in a lot of things and she did her job very you're into to tv mystery movies check this one out if you have a chance
hundstage is first fiction film this he directed great documentaries as animal love or models seidl worked on this project for more than years but it only cost around million dollars the actors are very good especially the non-professional actors who nearly played cinematography is good too the whole film is shocking disturbing and some scenes may be too much for ordinary film shows a lot of sex and violence but also that people are lonely and not able to communicate with each other finally i've to say that this is one of the best and most rewarding austrian films in the past years please excuse my bad
anton newcombe makes the film and he is the main subject watching him knock up a song if not a whole album quickly showed the guy to be a real talent he thinks he is god but is so prollific and interesting the dw are not really that interesting in comparison musicly or otherwise hey do you haver a drivers license anton says to the cameraman well lets go pawn this guitar great use of home video material great to see rock docs still being made a cool doc about the creative process if you like this go see nirvana live tonight sold out on dvd a good experience anton is this film out of
a meteor crashes into crater lake the heat from the impact causing a prehistoric egg to so the plot is just trash but despite its obvious low budget this comes across as one of the most gripping and entertaining monster-on-the-loose films in existence there are also some good moments of humor in an age filled so-called monsters which are no more than laughable men-in-rubber-suit creations or lizards dressed up in frills and forced to rip each other to pieces exploitation-style refreshing to discover that the plesiosaur in this little gem is an excellent harryhausen-style stop-motion a hard film to find but worth finding
i got to see the movie on thin ice on the television in india i must say the movie was really well done and really sent a chill down my spine the basic story makes me ponder what makes certain addicts decide to move on where as others still remain i felt that diane keaton was at her best the scene where she has cravings and begins rummaging her home for cocaine was the best the two boys are good and lynda boyd also showed what a good actress she script is well done as is the cinematography and direction and must must watch movie for everyone
i have recently seen this movie due to recent success with brokeback mountain i figured i would see the movies that i missed i had no expectations going into the film so was astounded that i had missed this movie at all a gripping father and son tale and it is also an underdog story i even shed a tear at the finale of this wonderful tale this movie appeals to all ages the only reason i give it a out of is that it slows down a little in the middle but it comes back strong in the end the acting was great the story was magnificent and the cinematography was captivating given the setting of the film go see this movie rent it buy it watch it love it i know i did
this is a fan-made short film that pretends to be a preview for a new movie that pairs batman and superman the sort of film that fans adore and watch at places like comiccon and was made by the same person who made batman dead end sandy far as this film goes i could easily pick it apart sure the cgi effects aren't perfect and the costumes are far from perfect but this was made on a shoestring budget and for a fan film this is incredible i was particularly impressed by the very buff was no wimpy little guy if only this were a preview for a real have fans lined up from here to omaha to see it great job
tis is a farly typical tom and jerry short-a situation is designed conflict arises and mayhem ensues the characters behave in appropriate ways the natural tensions between various characters leads to general chaos the best funniest part is when the peace treaty is in force and respected-all sorts of strange wonders appear before your eyes a word of warning-it is most unwise to allow tom to help you perform your morning cleansing routine highly recommended
the usual cat and mouse antics abound until jerry jumps into a bottle of invisible ink he gets the bright idea of torturing tom without him knowing the cat gets wise and tries to do stuff to make him see jerry even if not fool-proof of course jerry gets butch aka killer aka spike the dog into the act if late in the short and his contribution is minimal indeed brilliant animated short which kind of reminded me of the one with the white mouse who scares tom so badly most of the gags work and all violent as any good tom and jerry short should truly be this hilarious cartoon can be found on disc one of the spotlight collection dvd of tom jerry grade
docteur petiot starring michel serrault is a brutal story about a brutal man a doctor who heals the sick in occupied france even if their ability to compensate is not there yet he preys on the weakest amidst the populace the imagery and cinematography are superb and lend an additional macabre feeling to this complex story he is the perfect psychopath seductive and altruistic intelligent and caring calculating and murderous a movie certain not to be forgotten soon by the viewer kudos to mr serrault for his chilling portrayal
i went to see this movie with a bunch of friends one night i didn't really hear much about it so i wasn't expecting anything but after i saw it i really liked it nicolas cage and the rest of the cast were very good but i do have to say giovanni acting performace did need a little perking up but such a small flaw it could be overrided in seconds is about a retired car thief who must boost rare and exotic cars in one night to save his life the movie is in no way predictable so the ending should be a suprise think just another fast car driving movie well you are partially right there is much more to it everyone should take a look at this movie
i can understand those who dislike this movie cause of a lack of of all those girls are not geisha but brothel tenants and one that don't know the difference will not understand half of the movie and certainly not the end this is a complete art work about the life and needs in this era everything is important and certainly the way they dress all over the movie means more than words to those who thought it was a boring geisha movie i'll suggest you to read a bit about this society before making a conclusion that is so out of the reality this is work of is life and i'm sure that the director understood the silent meaning of piece to the right intellectual range
unique movie about confused woman crouse who gets involved with sharp con men joe mantegna gives an oscar-caliber performance as the slickest of the group absolutely enchanting first hour as mantegna shows crouse the ropes of his con games story line unravels a bit later on but still stands as a unique portrayal of an innocent caught up in a dark world definitely worth a shot
a chemist develops a fabric that never gets dirty or wears out but it is seen as a threat to the survival of various industries in this delightful ealing studios comedy guinness is marvelous as the mild-mannered but persistent chemist greenwood with her sensual voice plays the love interest parker is her harried father thesiger is amusing as a patriarch of the fabric industry while telling an engaging story the film also raises some intriguing questions about science the economy and politics it is adeptly directed by mackendrick who would go on to make the ladykillers and the sublime sweet smell of success later in the
had this movie been made a few years later i would have given it a lower score however for this was a dandy little movie and still stands up pretty well today just don't try to compare this silent film to later industry changed so radically that the shorts of the first decade of the century don't look at all like movies made in the and movie is minutes long average for most films back then and is a variation of the edgar allen poe story the cask of amontillado while many are familiar with the story i won't elaborate further as i don't want to ruin the film just suffice to say that very creepy
i don't think this movie is for everyone but i saw it this weekend in seattle and i thought it was so funny i haven't laughed that hard during a movie in long time i thought the entire cast did a great job you will find yourself laughing from the first moment through the very last scene i suspect some moviegoers the ones who take themselves way too seriously will be turned off by this brand of humor not me the movie was a real surprise and the entire theater was rolling with laughter throughout the showing i went to which makes me think that a lot of people enjoyed themselves and were happy to have a good time at the movies for a change i cannot wait to see it again if you're in the mood to lol then this is for you funny funny funny funny
i never saw this movie until i bought the tape last year i was enthralled and entertained it has all the elements of what i love to see in a sci-fi story in a book or on the screen social commentary speculation and a good something eerie and amusing watching a view of the distant future of the and think a must see and not only for sci-fiers
my wife kate and i absolutely loved the series and can't wait for the next one there is a sequel i would love to know what the catchy song is called and who wrote it maybe because i am old and grey and still interested in if anyone has the full lyrics please send course one big reason why my wife and i liked this series so much was that we are years old and retired but still very active intellectually great to see a show that highlights the contribution to society that can still be made by older people with special skills and experience the human interest aspect showing the interactions of the characters and the younger people around them is an important part of the series is highly entertaining and very sophisticated on a par with some of our other favourites spooks and hustle
otto dana andrews cycle of films noirs are among the unsung jewels of the genre because they lack paranoia misogyny or hysteria they may have seemed out of place at the time but the clear-eyed imagery the complex play with identity masculinity and representation the subversion of traditional psychological tenets the austere geometrical style all seem startlingly modern today and very similar to melville the lucid ironies of this film are so loaded brutal and ironic that the happy ending is one of the cruellest in hollywood history brilliant on the level of entertaining thriller as well tense and packed with double-edged dialogue
this is a romantic comedy where albert einstein played wonderfully by walter matthau and his cronies play match maker to his niece ryan and a talented auto mechanic robbins the interplay among these major roles is augmented by a terrific supporting cast of well recognized character actors this movie is cute and fun a feel-gooder hearty recommendations
classic western with incredible cinematography that is well ahead of the production is very good and you can tell that it was done with pride and peek into the american northt west pioneers is very educational and movie is very under rated because most people do not like to see the reality that many lawmen during this particular time and place were very much like most developing countries action sequences could have been more realistic though but movie really covers most of the for an audience who wants only pure testoterone type westerns for this movie is more for those who have a sense of history and philosophy
this movie was excellent for the following reasons it contained great backdrops and sets it showed the disparity of a war-torn environment alongside a technological one john acting was terrific he portrayed angst very well it showed the vulnerabilities of everyone in a war-torn situation it gave us a picture of what might happen in the future in many respects i was also impressed with the acting for the most part acting was i found the most stilted the morals and values of everyone in a war-torn situation are up for grabs the liberal journalist and the conservative business man are capable of doing anything in any situation and are equally unpredictable great stuff psp
okay so a little hokey-looking by standards and some of the acting is pretty stilted and most of the special effects could now be duplicated by a bright year old kid with a decent computer editing program and don't get me started about the is still a great movie years after it was released i grew up watching science fiction on the local tv science theater on sunday afternoons so i've seen quite a few sf movies from the at a time when most movies were content to slap a rubber costume on somebody and have him demolish a miniature model of a city forbidden planet forever raised the bar and showed that it was possible to make a science fiction movie which actually had a doubt that many sf movies made in the will still be considered worth watching in
may wonderland is fairly new in the uk brilliant film of a brutal true story if you know la from the early you will appreciate how well it is captured the use of the elements which make up its gritty cinematic style is original amplifying the experience and bringing the viewer very close to actually being there the use of a disjointed pulp fiction style time line allows exploration of the uncertainty concerning what really happened while the direction and performances of the cast command attention especially val kilmer as john holmes an oscar for sure if i were handing them out
i watched it subtitled as it was in russian but really enjoyed it the main character sasha was born cursed with a deadly weapon as an extension of his body he lived his whole life unhappy because he was different and because anger caused him to do deadly things sasha finally found love in a young woman named katya everyone tried to take her away from him ending in a deadly battle there was a fair amount of gore but not too much for the weak for people who like the regular old hollywood movie but for those who enjoy independent films kinda got the feeling of an asian fantasy film
i feel like i have some uber-rare disease that no one has heard of and i have finally come across a support group on the net i finally found this title by asking for an answer on an experts site on the web i too saw this movie in my youth and was struck by the atmosphere and especially the ending i have never forgotten it and have never seen it since no one i know saw the film and i had almost given up on ever finding title alas even knowing the name i shall probably never see the film again as it is impossible to find commercially small
the sunshine boys is a terrific comedy about two ex-vaudevillians who reluctantly reunite for a tv special despite the fact that they despise each comic genius of two masters at work george burns and walter matthau are stellar some of the best scenes are when the duo is fighting over the silliest little trivial things the material is fast-paced and witty appealing to all spoiler alert there are some mildly sad moments toward the end of the movie that deal indirectly with the affects of aging that gives the film a soft sincere tenderness that shows to this reviewer that what the pair really need the most for success are each anyone loves the odd couple you'll adore this movie an excellent film
not sure why it doesn't play in peoria apparently but this is a very funny clever british comedy set at the end of the swinging sixties peter sellars is fantastic as the rich forty-something serial womaniser the perfectly delectable goldie hawn playing a year american girl in london is initially sellars catch of the day but the urbane tv food critic can't stop himself from falling for the dizzy american pathos great script strong performances from the leads and supporting a great film and the best gag is the very last it you'll like it
made only ten years after the actual events and set in the bunker under the reichstag film is wholly gripping it reeks of sulfurous death awaiting the perpetrators of world war haven't seen this in over three decades but it remains strong in my visual and emotional memory the characters seem to be waiting to be walled up in their cave searing bit of dialog between two generals does god exist if he did we wouldn't shame this is not more readily available for exhibition or purchase because it would be interesting to view and compare this film with the documentary about traudl junge im toten winkel blind spot secretary and downfall with bruno ganz
bread very sharply skewers the conventions of horror movies in general and night of the living dead in specific and is constantly inventive the production values are a little rough at times a student film after all but it never loses sight of its goal to entertain hey george romero liked it enough to include it on the remastered dead video tape laserdisc and dvd that should tell you something
what are the odds of a mermaid helium balloon traveling from yuba city nov and landing days nov in mermaid prince edward island miles this is a great movie it is based on a true story this movie helps not only children cope with losses but older people as well hope everyone will enjoy it rhonda
i first saw this in the movie theater when it came out and the crowd was really into the movie which made the experience all the more fun this is a great cast of characters many big names in it a few of which were not as recognized then as they are now i think a great idea if you follow any of these actors or have loved them in other movies to add it to your watched list some of the scenes actually remind me of the type of well-done comedy as in the birdcage or even the clue kind of odd spontaneous-appearing comedy with some really professional delivery from these beloved actors the movie did a great job at giving you some insight perhaps even very realistic into the culture of a daytime soap
for those of you that don't that reference clubberin was fists hitting one onto the miss wcw saturday night some of my favorite wrestling moments took place on this stage i remember watching stunning steve austin rick rude brian pillman cactus jack dustin rhodes johnny b badd ddp in his jobber days lord steven regal harlem heat ricky steamboat be here a while listing everyone point is wcw had an awesome roster in the pre hogan days and they were producing entertaining television dusty rhodes on commentary in later years gave me a whole new reason to watch when i started smoking pot as a really wish vince would put him on the mic for a show or two maybe at the next great american bash they clubberin here comes da plunda he was
this movie explores the difficulties that strain hopes dreams love and friendship and incorporates humour beautifully along with a stunning cast and brilliant filming the sound track enhances and amplifies the atmosphere and mood of this work of art all actors and actresses give an extremely good performance surpassing expectation in every way parminder nagra is brought on to the big screen for the first time in this film and she is exceptional capturing the vividness and vitality that this movie is all about keira knightly also works well with her co-stars and this is her best work so in all this is brilliant film and one that everyone should make the effort to see at least once
rating master years ago i heard spielberg comment that he would redo the movie here and there if he had a chance well mr spielberg i guess nothing is perfect but this movie together with list is your best even oprah acts well in this one got me most is the realism of the story and drama stuff like this happened and is still happening in the world
saw this today with my year old i thought it was cute i agree with the other poster that it wasn't anything like the book that i can remember but we still enjoyed it all of the kids are pretty good and all in all pretty entertaining billy is the new kid who accepts a dare by the school bully to eat worms in a day if he loses he has to walk down the hall at school with worms in his pants the beginning of the movie is set up to show that billy has a very weak stomach and pukes at almost anything hilarity ensues with a bunch of different way to cook the worms good message about standing up to bullies and of course a sappy happy ending
so you think a talking parrot is not your cup of tea huh well think again paulie is a wonderful film filled with touching characters are all lovable especially paulie as he enters the lives of many people on his is journey worth experiencing don't miss it it is available on home video
this movie is just too funny a totally non-pc gangster romp if mel brooks made a picture about the mob in the it would probably look like this too many great one-liners to to remember and while its not for everyone anyone who doesnt laugh a whole bunch of times doesnt have a pulse so put it on and laugh you iceholes
just after the end of wwii powell pressburger were asked to come up with something to try to heal the rift developing between the uk the usa at the time there was a lot of overpaid over sexed and over here type of comments somehow they came up with this favourite movie of all time got everything romance poetry emotion religion drama and very can never explain exactly why but it hits all the right buttons and although i've seen it hundreds of times really i'm still guaranteed to be in tears at many points it the magnificent acting the wonderful sets the inspired script who knows but watch it and you'll see what i mean
a great american martial arts movie the fighting scenes were pretty impressive for american movie made in of course the fighting scenes aren't that good as in honk kong movies actually only few american movies have fighting scenes which are as good as in honk kong movies even nowadays when you watch american martial arts movie you are expecting to see less impressive fighting scenes but still having some nice moves which can be surprisingly good sometimes or at least what i'm expecting from these movies i was impressed by this film some fighting scenes were really impressive the acting direction and the plot were good enough so a really worth watching movie if you like american martial arts films of the
this was one of the funniest and informative shows that i have ever seen this is a must see for anyone over the age of this show had me and my boys laughing out loud from the beginning i don't know if everything on the show was true but the way it was presented left little doubt that mr wuhl was not only very knowledgeable but he also had a blast presenting this information to the very lucky college kids who were in attendance if mr wuhl ever decides to do this format again they will have to rent a building the size of the georgia dome to hold all the people who will want to see it i agree with the idea of making this a hbo series it would have an amazing following
good film tells a boyish fantasy story telling us how trapped we are in social situations and what kind of extreme measures one has to take to behave differently or at least the feeling that you have to break every rule if you are to break one if you wanted to express love for someone you don't know how would you do it without creating a pressing social situation also about the fascism of deciding over others cultural life of what kind of culture that is jammed down our throats what gives disney or fox or the suicide bomber the right to decide what is our choice are one not allowed to drink the morning coffee by one self do we have to listen to the nrj shouting see the stupid tabloid headlines and the street commercials before we even have had our morning coffee
it is a story of siberian village people from the beginning of century till the it is about passion and feelings about russian soul and very romantic this movie is not action packed it flowes slowely in second part one can find great songs russian romances it is much more better than doctor zhivago the director of this movie moved to america and made runaway train for example
this superb film draws on a variety of talented actors and musicians at the top of their form levant crosby martin rathbone manone are completely at home in the story that apparently was supplied by billy wilder one would love to know more about how much he had to do with it because an exceptionally clever variation on the sterile servant tale nearly an allegory of the entertainment industry run by dried-up numskulls but made into a vibrant world of art and play by an exploited underclass of nobodies and non-wasps looking at the last six decades of music tv and film in the us hard not to see the underlying insights of this film as prophetic
i had read an article about dan olympic and personal journey before seeing this movie i'm always intrigued by a story of hope and overcoming life altering events and this was no background of the characters that is provided gives you a sense of the closeness and how they positively affected each others lives i can't speak to the accuracy of specific details in this movie it is customary to take some creative license when organizing a script however the spirit of dan and his family is what matters a worthwhile movie of a story that should be told i felt empathy for the characters and cheered at the end
incredible film that though isn't very touching and almost life for me at worth seeing and buying added to my favorite movie number one is a very touching movie that all people should man in the just incredible now my favorite movie and i only saw it today and i'd recommend it to anyone above as long as you're somewhat you don't really try to feel the characters emotions then you'll never get the true meaning and value of this it really is watch it because it'll alter the way some people look at seeing
spacecamp is one of the movies that kids just love and mom and dad can have fun watching as well growing up in the i enjoyed this movie plot and all the actors i recently purchased this movie on dvd so when i have kids of my own they will be able to have as much fun watching this movie as i did the plot is fun a group of kids embark on a journey they never expected when they were rocketed into space by a overachieving robot they were in auh at first but when they realized they didn't have enough oxygen to make it back panic sunk in once they recovered enough oxygen from the space station they returned to earth as even better friends and a new found respect for life
go see this movie for the gorgeous imagery of andy sculptures and treat yourself to a thoroughly eye-opening and relaxing experience the music perfectly complements the footage but never draws attention towards itself some commentators called the interview snippets with the artist a weak spot but consider this why would you expand on this in a movie if you can read musings at length in his books or attend one of his excellent lectures this medium is much more suitable to show the ephemeral nature of the works and is used expertly in this respect
hatred of a minute is a hauntingly beautiful film a psychological thriller that takes you on a journey through the nightmare that is the life of a serial killer eric seaver strong performances and excellent cinematography make this film a must see for any film student or horror fan the realness of the story and the human side of eric separate this film from other psycho killer movies some shout outs to the producer bruce campbell as well as to the film the evil dead add some humor for anyone that knows the genre
i've just finished viewing the disc in a episodes collection created in conjunction with the ucla film television archive entertainment inc so far from the episode the image quality is quite good the dvd box is shown on the title page here on peepers is just as charming as when i first saw it old at the time and wally cox is truly endearing in this role if you're in the mood for quiet comedy that sneaks up on you as opposed to hitting you over the head you'll treasure this chance to experience all the wonderful characters you might remember from your childhood although some of the gags are a bit corny most are ingenious and even the corny ones are fun this is one tv series that lives up to my early childhood memories of it
i watched this film in shire is possibly one of the best films of all time it has a timeless value you can get so much out of it amazing there are parts that are moving funny and just aspect are spot on the portrayal of the story is perfect every detail is genuine even small irish subtleties have been use of low and high shots gives two great views on cristy out for performance is incredible i've never seen an actor do that ever it really is so great to watch it flows so well probably the closest thing yo can get to real life experience i love you haven't seen it you should see it don't have any doubts on it there is something there for all
la bête by walerian borowczyk is based on the short story lokis written by prosper american heiress betrothed to the son of an impoverished at the crumbling château and learns of a mythical ursine beast purported to prowl the nearby is fabled that a former lady of the engaged in perverse sex with the creature and lucy finds herself consumed by dreams of the incident the beast is an art-house mix of surreal sleaze and implied and perversion in the fake ejaculate smeared on bared with a rose and most graphic of eponymous beast toying with incredibly big this genuinely erotic film is wonderfully photographed and women here are stunningly beautiful and they are naked most of the la bête is a visual it be from the fetishistic attention to the visual motifs pregnant with masterpiece should be watched with care and must-see for fans of european cult cinema
the maxx is a deep psychological introspective lightly camouflaged as a weird-out superhero story julie winters is a freelance social worker in an unnamed filthy city ridden with crime and she and everyone she knows has a lot of issues to work through the maxx is her friend and client a street bum who thinks a costumed superhero or is it the other way maxx is not to be missed for the artwork the story itself or the excellent voice work particularly the late barry deliciously urbane drippingly evil voicing of the main villain mr you get the chance to see this don't miss it
this is an amazing film both for the incredibly energy evoked from the frenetic flamenco dancing and from the unique way that the filmmakers interweave the story of the stage production with the lives of the characters preparing for it spellbinding is the only word i can use to describe the experience this is not carmen by any usual standard this is not a usual film by any standard every nuanced glance every stomp of the foot every piece of the music is intertwined so captivatingly that you can't take your eyes off the screen you don't need to love opera or be captured enraptured enthralled by this film subtle and direct loud and still one of if not the best movies of kind because there are so few like it
well some people would say that this particular movie hey thats not right not right at movie may not have the best special effects and may not have the best actors the exelence of the barbarian bros dispite theese minor fact i can honostly say that this is one of the funniest movies ever seen and seen em al
as an aging rocker this movie mentions heep and quo my favourite bands ever but with the incredible cast and the fantastic storyline i just love this piece of creative genius i cannot recommend it more highly and mick jones added so much lead and primary songwriter along with the greatest rock singer ever lou gramm i have watched this great work more than bill nighy what a voice and jimmy nail talent oozes from every pore then astrid and karen what more could an aging rocker ask for bloody perth western oz originally from windsor england
wow saw this last night and i'm still reeling from how good it was every character felt so real most of them petty selfish and the bizarre story middle aged widow starts shagging her feckless boyfriend felt utterly convincing top performances all round but hats off to anne reid and our friends in the daniel craig latter coming across as the next david director roger michell this is as far from notting hill as possible to be thank this movie
maybe it wasn't that good as a whole but the second episode which was the first one i say was so memorable i still remember it today i became a fan of dick francis i would recommend it if you are interested in horse racing and cockney slang of the sidekick chico barnes is a lot more amusing to those of us who have never been close to hearing bow bells but the leads are attractive and the shows were halley was one of francis more interesting characters and the show actually minimizes some of the difficulties with his hand interestingly electronic hands of the sort used in the stories are apparently less functional for the user than the sort invented after world war ii
this has got to be the best movie i've ever breathtaking cinematography with stunning acting and a gripping plot and you have a bite dog had me gripping the edge of my seat during some scenes recoiling in horror during others and left me drowning in my own tears after the tragic film left a deep impression on me shockingly violent scenes contrasted sharply with the poignant and tender love scenes the film is undeserving of cat iii rating there are no nude scenes whatsoever and the love scenes do not even involve kissing or making message which this film presented to me all human beings no matter how violent or cruel they may seem have a tender side edison chen does a superb job playing the part of the murderous rate this film a must-watch
most people who have seen this movie thinks that it is the best movie ever made i disagree but this movie is very very good tony is a bad ass guy and knows that intimidating and uses it to get ahead about him and how he goes from washing dishes to having a huge house and a office with cocaine all over the desk if you want a family movie then this isn't the way to go but if you want mobsters and vengeance and stuff like that then you'll like it
a timeless classic wonderfully acted with perfect location settings conjuring a marvelous atmospheric movie a simple story mingled with humor and suspense i wish that a video was available in britain i have seen this film on many occasions and it remains one of my favorites along with oh mr porter
this is a great movie i did the play a while ago it had an extra to it i loved vanessa williams as rosey and also jason alexander has a good voice it was great the setting were also very good except the fact that it is hours and minutes makes it pretty long overall i give it stars they also added a few parts but it was still cool
it has been about years since a movie has been made about romance and mysticism the only two movies i can think of is enchanted april and the enchanted cottage both movies used wonderful actors not stars in both movies all the actors gave their best romantic april is about four english women after wwi who are unhappy with their lives and find happiness in italy while on vacation it is amazing enchanted april was made in it stands out as an enjoyable classic
screened at the san francisco international film festival under the title come undone april the cinematographer uses techniques that add to the storytelling even with backgrounds for the present and spring summer for the flashbacks there can be some difficulty following the either lead is gay the actors well-portray the budding relationship in real life terms from physical violence toward each other to their passionate lovemaking the story pulls you into the characters a bit slowly in the beginning but as the end approaches you really care about where these guys will be next summer you too will want a sequel to find out
a surprisingly complex and well crafted study of the first serial killer in the ussr set in the days of perestroika this intense piece is brought to full life with the performances of stephen reah and donald examination of cicatillo as a killer is well rounded and by hinting at some of his behaviors while out right showing others there is a subtlety that is compelling without being overtly graphic not for the weak of heart however as subject matter is often disturbing but necessary to full development of the main participants in this fact based has furnished us with an excellent film in an unusual manner congrats to the director and editor of this great piece it is in my top must see list
simply one of the funiest movies i've ever seen a parody of crime-life parody of everything that represents the chicago there is no realy need to underestimate this movie because rating is under its a opinion of a mass and mass is hypnotized who decide to watch it it will regret who decide not to watch it will regret more
jim mckay has made one of the best films you will see all quiet simplicity of this film draws you in from the opening shot and never lets is not one false note in the entire hand-held camera is never distracting and always where it should three young ladies whose lives we follow are always isn't a single beat where the audience is reminded we are looking at actresses performing a are just real girls trying to find is no political or is cinema at its most although it will probably only be seen by a handful of deserves a much wider special hats off to hugh hefner for providing the film-makers with the grant money needed to get this important film can't wait to see what mr mckay does next
fast-paced funny sexy and spectacular cagney is always terrific blondel charms you with her wit and energy obvious that this is a pre-censorship film by the innuendo in the script the the way they touch each other and bikinis before there were bikinis this is no holds barred fun for everyone i don't understand the john garfield issue though does it matter whether or not in this film if he is he screen is so short that basically a prop you need to watch it frame by frame to even find him if there i'm a big cagney fan but had never seen this one before i found it on turner classics i found it by wonderful accident sit back and enjoy the ride
after seeing this film for the time now i think it is almost worst film punch drunk love is poor in comparison to this i must say at the end when dickie gets thrown of the boat it is so funny hair is different to his and i like it when he flips everyone off this film should only be brought if your a true adam sandler characters are poor in comparison to his funny films like the waterboy which has the same people in it dante who is one of the assassins trying to kill the australian film lack depth and a decent story line and deserves to be in the bottom
the reason why people say that this movie scared them is because it did that means the movie purpose was felt by a few who did see it when i first saw this movie it scared me and made me think about life and religion this is not a blood and gore scary type movie but the kind that you would think that it may be possible for things to happen the way the movie was written of course non believers will say its only a sci-fi movie truth is this movie is a must have for your thriller collection even if it does have a religious view if you are a fan of classic thrillers this is one of them and its a must have i never saw the sequel thunder but i believe it picks up where this movie ends
the story centers around barry mckenzie who must go to england if he wishes to claim his inheritance being about the grossest aussie shearer ever to set foot outside this great nation of ours there is something of a culture clash and much fun and games ensue the songs of barry crocker are highlights
the late great robert bloch of psycho for those of you who weren't paying attention scripted this tale of terror and it was absolutely one of the scariest movies i ever saw as a kid had to walk miles just to see a movie and it was usually dark when i emerged from the theater seeing a horror movie was always unnerving but particularly so when it was as well-executed as this one when i had the opportunity to see this one several years ago on videotape should always be a last resort i was surprised at how well it held up take the terror test watch it at night alone and then tell me not scary
jiøí trnka made his last animated short an indictment of totalitarism which caused him trouble in his native czechoslovakia the elements are few the symbolisms simple and his trademark ornaments almost absent here allowing the viewer to concentrate on the fable a man in his room dedicates to pottery and to take care of his only plant but suddenly a huge hand enters the room and orders him to make a statue of itself the man refuses and persecuted by the ominous gloved hand in these days where the impression of reality factor seems to be erased from most animations that try to replace the real world it is refreshing to watch a film which makes its technique part of the enjoyment
another detailed work on the subject by dr dwivedi takes us back in time to pre-partioned panjab dr dwivedi chose a difficult subject for his movie debut he has worked on all meticulous details to bring the story to life the treatment of the subject is very though we have not been to the region during that time the sets and costumes look real unlike most movies made on partition this one focuses not on the gory details of violence to attract audience but on its after-effects the characters come to life priyanshu chatterjee has given an impressive performance manoj bajpai has acted his heart out showing the plight of a guilt-ridden man the rest of the cast has done a good job too
i watched the movie in a preview and i really loved it the cast is excellent and the plot is sometimes absolutely hilarious another highlight of the movie is definitely the music which hopefully will be released soon i recommend it to everyone who likes the british humour and especially to all musicians go and see great
overall i agree wholly with review in a sense i feel that i should not even be commenting since it is so much a movie and i am not a vet was a resister the flaw is that martha is badly underdeveloped and does not act consistently my guess is that stephen metcalfe is a vet himself and spent too little planning time on her character
non-sensical title and bill paxton directs headline aside this is a pretty good old fashioned rip snorting biblical horror thriller in the end it may end up only being the inbred southern gothic cousin of the hey a pretty damn entertaining notion also got a doozy of a plot a very ambiguous moral message this is the kind of movie that years from now people will catch late at night on basic cable and scare the beejesus out of themselves watching it too bad director bill paxton had to go hire himself to a devil of a good rent
ghost new house is a terrific horror story this is from the circle of fear and the ghost story series of the early beginning and ending of each story is narrated by sebastian cabot remember him from the early family series family affair in the this particular story has barbara parkins and david birney as the lead actors and as the main characters in the saw this i was so you are would not recommend that you watch story is gore or curse words but very scary barbara parkins played the young bride david birney played her actors were very good in their you like scary ghost stories then you will like this little gem i gave this a high highly recommend this story
the sweet is never as sweet without the sour this quote was essentially the theme for the movie in my opinion tom cruise plays a young man who was handed everything in his life he takes things for granted and it comes around full swing in this great movie with a superb twist this film will keep you engaged in the plot and unable to pause it to take a bathroom a movie that really makes you step back and look at your life and how you live it you cannot really appreciate the better things in life sweet like love until you have experienced the bad sour the theme will really get you to open your complaint is that the movie gets very twisted at points and is hard to really understand i think the end is perfect though i recommend you watch it and see for yourself
my wife and i have watched this movie twice both of us used to be in the military besides being funny as hell it offers a very realistic view of life in the navy from the perspective of a navy enlisted man and tells it like it really is we're adding this movie to our permanent collection
i love claire danes and kate beckinsale looks amazingly immature in her role the movie is flawed only because it seems the two accused seem to be in some monastery working like monks in the grass and under strict almost martial-arts-like discipline the acting and filmography and amazing colors of what is supposed-to-be thailand is eye-catching but claire daines steals the entire movie and is unexpectedly profound in her learning the hard lesson of life itself to the very end in an act of amazing unselfishness unheard of and completely unexpected in the real world the flaws are minute and i recommend the film which seems buried sadly forever to rare tv showings i for one want the film for my a collection of only rated films watch it you will be very touched
lost is largely considered one of the most beautiful tv series that have never done and so is if you lovers of mysteries intrigue and adventure this is the series for you in the first season since the first episode starts to go increasingly to move forward until you get to the second season in the second you lose a little its cocktail of mystery and expectation and pushes very on and reveal the various mysteries that the island hides the third season is perhaps the second most beautiful because resumed suffered since the first episode with the pace and tenacity of the first season the fourth also not let pass unnoticed and tends to reveal a little mysteries but not as the second season but at a somewhat different for the fifth season expects
the unseen is done in a style more like old hollywood mysteries than a horror show the film is somewhat slow but lots of bizarre imagery keeps it the film alive and watchable the basic idea of young girls stalked by something in the basement is old but good acting and production make the movie worth watching the movie is notable for its emotional impact and certainly not for any explicit action or special effects i rated it an out of
never heard of this it on example of a movie that took every cast member to make it overhyped typical hollywood movie with the same old overhyped current quote a list actor could have pulled off any performance in this back memories of my own post vietnam war military concentrated on the people who were sent to was portrayed by the characters who had fears and emotions even if some volunteered for were regular people just weren't cut out for military remember a few in my put it mildly couldn't adapt to military life either-but i'll never forget them-should have stayed in highly recommend it and then think about those serving present day in training is a trip notice those drill sergeants aren't morning people and maybe they need sensitivity training
while listening to an audio book cambpell scott is the reader i was so excited to hear his voice and that brought back my disappointment that six degrees was canceled they never seem to keep the good shows on air long enough to capture an audience that can connect with the shows story what a shame and shame on th network for not giving this show a full seasons chance this was an excellent show to watch with a great cast the network gave men in trees a second chance witch is also a great show but they took invasion off and that also was something totally different to watch not the same old-same old themes why can't the networks get it right
i rented this movie this past weekend cranked up the surround sound system and got some great sound from special affects this movie is a great movie rental the special affects where enough to scare my fiance but i noticed some looked suprisingly computer generated i didn't go to the movies and see this but its a scary late night don't feel like going out movie i would recommend it
monstervision was a show i grew up with from late night hosting with penn and teller to the one the only joe bob briggs the show kept me up friday nights back in my high school years and provided some of the best drive-in memories to ever come outside of the a doubt the best late night television ever if you didn't stay up you were missing know john bloom and joe bob live on but i want them back where they anyone else sit through all hours of the swarm live monstervision
jerome crabbe has the lead role in this movie i saw this movie times and i still am not tired of it this movie is similar to flesh blood in some ways gerald soetman is a great writer he wrote all of paul dutch films paul verhoeven is one of the greatest directors i have seen all of his movies all except for showgirls my mom does not like him so much but i disagree i think all of his films are a ride to watch especially total recall and basic instinct jerry goldsmith did some of his movies which include total recall basic instinct and hollow man i wish jerry goldsmith never died dutch films are different but still enjoyable
this is my favorite of the older tom jerry cartoons from the early the original version with mammy two shoes is on the tom jerry spotlight collection set disc one and showcases the wonderful detailed animation of the early cartoons the gags on this one aren't all madcap avery style but more subtle and aimed at anyone ever stayed up late watching scary movies radio programs tom is listening to a creepy radio show and jerry decides to play a number of tricks to spook him the nine-lives gag is well done here and i don't know how many times i tried to make a vacuum and a sheet that scary when i was a kid when owner is awakened by the mammy was not the maid it was her she gets one heck of a surprise with a big laugh get your pause button ready worth it
this is another gem of a stand up show from eddie izzard you cannot fail to laugh at the wide range of topics he talks about he even takes the piss out of his american audiance at times and most of them didnt even realise it a must see for anybody who likes comedians out of
i have seen this movie this movie is the best according need dowry in marriages is the major problem nowadays in stating this problem this movie is the best in this movie the indian values are stated very well youth must understand this problem there is less population of girls and due to this problem of dowry the girls committed suicide if this problem continues then the day when there is no girl child is not far keep in mind this statement youth must understand that we can not take dowry in have to learn from this movie that the dowry should not be if we understand this problem then we can see the new trend in the society this is the major change in the society
the undoubted highlight of this movie is peter performance in turn wildly comical and terribly terribly tragic does anybody do it better than o'toole i don't think so what a great face that man story is an odd one and quite disturbing and emotionally intense in parts toward the end but it is also oddly touching and does succeed on many levels however i felt the film basically revolved around peter luminous performance and i'm sure i wouldn't have enjoyed it even half as much if he hadn't been in it
i'm no big fan of martial arts movies but the video shop was nearly empty and jet li was in lethal weapon and i got it free when the other films i'd rented either way i rented it i absolutely loved it my flatmate and myself year old biochemistry and accountancy students spent the half hour after the film making strange kung fu noises and throwing beermat shurikens at each other i can't explain it maybe a little tequila i never enjoyed bruce lee skinny bloke kicking big bloke beating him kicking bigger bloke etc film ends think jackie chan with a little less comedy and more action
excellent film dealing with the life of an old man as he looks back over the years starting around he reminisces about his boy and young adulthood his family friends romances etc very nostalgic piece with a bittersweet things in life come together as one and a river runs through it and that river haunts me worth seeing
this movie is best i still cant get enough of watching some of his best stunts ever i also like the bad guys in this movie old man looks like a chinese version of john howard unlike some of other work this movie has also got a great story line and i recommend it to all of fans
this document truly opened my eyes to what people outside of the united states thought about the september attacks this film was expertly put together and presents this disaster as more than an attack on soil the aftermath of this disaster is previewed from many different countries and perspectives i believe that this film should be more widely distributed for this point it also helps in the the healing process to finally see something other than news reports on the terrorist attacks and some of the pieces are actually funny but not abusively so this film came highly recommended to me and i pass on the same feeling
i have to be honest i was expecting a failure so bad because it really did sound like they were trying to milk the original movie to get money but that wasn't the case with this pretty funny odd movie i loved how they told the story of timon and pumba the story with simba and him having trouble sleeping was funny the jacuzzi bubble and when pumba leaves the bubbles stop all harmless fun good for kids and some adults i think this movie will last for a while because it is rather good for a straight to video and dvd movie while the movie does seem a little odd and kind of trails off toward the end it works out of
although cinderella isn't the obvious choice for a sequel i love jaq and gus so i didn't hesitate the format of the mice writing a book for cinderella was an inspired one i enjoy writing stories myself and hope children will be encouraged by this the three stories are cute amusing although the songs were forgettable jaq and gus were my favourite characters but i also enjoyed seeing lucifer bruno the mice chorus and all the rest pom pom proved the perfect companion for lucifer and i liked the governess a sequel done right for a change my rating
peter first international success the last wave is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on aboriginal myth richard chamberlain gives a good performance as a defense lawyer whose life becomes increasingly unmoored from reality as he delves deeper into a murder case involving aboriginal tribal rivalries david gulpilil plays one of the suspects who does his best to guide chamberlin thru the realm of dreamtime an alternate central to native australian history and tribal custom heavy on atmosphere deliberately ambiguous in plotting the film builds to an unsettling finale which is somewhat diminished by poor effects probably due to budgetary limitations nevertheless an intriguing film whose overall impression of mystery and dread lurking just below the surface of what we perceive as reality will stay with you
reed hadley makes a better foppish don diego than he does a dashing and daring zorro but almost beside the point because this serial features the bar-none best theme song of any serial ever and the best version of yakima famous stagecoach stunt there are other good stunts and lots of action and plenty of hair-raising cliff-hanger chapter endings but if for no other reason you must see this film to watch the stagecoach stunt then re-watch it in slow motion it is incredible and despite the lower budget for this chapter play yak turns in a better take on the stunt here than he did in the far more celebrated film stagecoach indiana jones eat your heart out this is the real deal
i enjoyed this movie quite a lot i have always been a fan of whoopi goldberg and this movie only emphasizes it she portrays a housewife in an african-american family which is moving up the social chain due to the glover success as an attorney she moves to an all white neighborhood where the people are friendly yet a little awkward toward her the various events that arise during the course of the movie make for some laughs but mostly appeal to the other emotions this movie is not so much a comedy as a drama i give it a strong i highly recommend you catch it on tv or rent it soon
the french naudet brothers did something nobody else did they had a video camera the day that this tragedy happened they were in building when you could see papers drifting down people hitting the ground from jumping from such a mean it goes as far as when both buildings collapsed they went running their camera was still running when the white dust covered them they found a shop doorway and got inside but all this footage is real and i think they did a fantastic job of capturing it for stars goes to the naudet brothers that filmed this extraordinary film that i watch every so i'll never forget what this country went through i believe if i remember right it shows the first death of the priest of the firefighters while he was being carried to the church and his honorable funeral
to me a matter of life and death is just simply the best film ever beginning to end it oozes class it is stimulating thought provoking a mirror to the post war world and the relations between cinematography is simply stunning and the effect of mixing monochrome and technicolour to accent the different worlds works seamlessly the characters and plot development are near perfect and the attention to detail promotes a thoroughly believable matter how many times i watch the film and i have watched it a lot it never fails to touch me it makes me smile it makes me laugh it makes me think it makes me cry it is as fresh today as it was in i were allowed just one film to keep and watch again a matter of life and death would be that film
i think blackadder the third is the best one of the all the episodes are funny personally i really like the episode with the french invasion but the one with the superstitious actors in macbeth is also really funny the way rowan keeps playing on with them is really humor at the highest never say that again always call it the scottish play blackadder oh so you want me to say the scottish play actors yes blackadder rather than am a big fan of rowan and i have the majority of his work but i think he did the series of blackadder especially hope rowan is going to continue his great style but i think we can count on him because he is already working on a bean movie that will be out this year i can't give this blackadder a out of rating
this impossible tale is of a female witch pursuing a mortal man in a mortal world her community is open among members but she conceals her witchcraft from the mortals is starting to sound familiar lol not your typical movie very campy performances by jack lemmon and ernie kovacs keep things from getting dull kim novak is always a pleasure on screen but i found her pairing with james stewart unusual not fatal to the re-newed interest in all things witchy and dark this film deserves to be discovered and re-discovered by old and new audiences still a hoot
this amazing documentary gives us a glimpse into the lives of the brave women in judicial policewomen lawyers and judges despite tremendous lack of means the desperate poverty of the people multiple languages and multiple legal precedents depending on the region of the country and the background of the plaintiffs and these brave strong women are making a is a rare a truly inspiring movie that restores a little bit of faith in humankind despite the atrocities we see in the movie justice does get served thanks to these passionate hardworking only hope this film gets a wide release in the united states the more people who see this film the better
i loved this film because in my mind it seemed to so perfectly capture what i imagined life in french colonial africa must have been like in the generation anyway but i was truly enraptured by its quiet pacing and by the glorious ending within the last minutes of this film you must focus intently on happening never have i been more impressed with the wrap-up of a film i remember yelling wow when i realized it was over on the other hand my two daughters fell asleep on the couch
i remember this film from many years ago certainly the best film on the subject in my experience the fact that i vividly remember so much of the film after so long a time testifies to its impact is difficult to comment on the level of the performances because of the language barrier but they were nonetheless very subject continues to fascinate us even with the passing of years and it was most effectively treated here with the proper proportion of historical perspective and wish it would be shown on tv at least once or at least be available on tape or dvd or is it is some art film archive hoarding a copy of it
philo vance powell helps solve multiple murders among the wealthy after a dog i hate overly convoluted mysteries this but i love this movie it moves very quickly minutes is beautifully directed by michael curtiz uses tons of camera tricks that just speed the narrative along has a very ingenious story line a solution to a locked room murder that was just incredible and has a very good cast is very suave and great as doesn't seem to be is vance mary astor isn't given much to do but she adds class and beauty to the production everybody else is very good too but best of all is eugene pallette as detective heath a very good actor with a very distinctive voice and some of his lines were an excellent hollywood murder mystery well worth
dahl seems to have been under the influence of wenders the american friend innocent nick cage gets recruited for a hit dennis hopper plays a real hit man lara flynn boyle is dangerous the hero gets more entangled the more he tries to extricate hisself and small town america does not seem all that safer than the big city like predecessor mentioned above this movie has lots of plot twists and turns that seem improbable but all lead to the cathartic self discovery
one of the things that interested me most about this film is the way the characters and their associated histories are developed on the fly i suppose the writers wanted us to gain interest in the characters by not force feeding their characters the premise of using the art and craft of furniture design and construction was a unique theme analogy for what go through in life the complexity of having a twin serve as a surrogate father and even husband added great tension towards making this film emotionally interesting also although the story was not one that the masses might directly relate to business the themes are fairly universal as every family has a black sheep in it that made it very engaging
ever wonder where the ideas for romance novels and other paper back released come from according to jake speed they are based on real people living out the adventures they write about and publish this movie is quality family entertainment moderate amounts of violence and skimpy clothes at the worst the language is is also not a problem and the jokes are funny at all levels this is a austin powers look at indian jones without the over-the-top antics of michael myers i highly recommend this film for kids in the to range
hotel du nord is the only carné movie from the era which has dialogs not written by jacques by henri was much more interested in the couple than in the pair of latter is rather bland and their story recalls oddly the edith song les amants d'un that the tale is a tragic fascinating today is this popular little world the canal saint-martin movie is dear to the french movies buffs for another very special pimp jouvet tells his protégée raymonde he wants a change of because she does not understand the meaning of the world whore raymonde an insult and she delivers this is most famous of the whole french french que j'ai une gueule d'atmosphère translation i got an atmosphere face this is our french perfect
this is an excellent movie with a stellar cast and some great acting i never tire of watching it i especially love the scene where danny character and kevin character namely simon and mack have brunch together kevin kline is such a natural and it seems his mannerisms are effortless and one you would encounter often so its a very real movie of the most powerful scenes in the movie however is at the beginning of the movie when simon arrives at the scene where car has broken down the movie also has a strong message and is unlike the stereotypical message carrying movie where one person preaching his guts out to an audience instead the actors emotions and situations deliver an impactive message that does best without the use of words and lastly mary mcdonell is brilliant as always
this is the best film version of classic tale i've seen it over and over on vhs and recently acquired the dvd version which is formatted for tv wide-screen what i find interesting about this teleplay is the cast of english actors who are now recognizable since many have appeared in other in north america since my biggest surprise is edward woodward the equalizer as the ghost of christmas present
while the main story is supposed to take place in morocco this movie was shot in foggy romania in days on a very tight budget however broken their cards may be the actors and the crew play them with remarkable skill and commitment so that in the end i found the result both touching and graceful nikolaj coaster-waldau provides a formidable performance as the bad guy the script and direction provide some gems whether you will like the movie or not however will probably depend on your take on alexandra staden in the title role other reviewers have pointed out inadequacies as modesty blaise they may have a point but i found her interpretation delightful and very fitting modesty manages to overcome terrible odds through discipline innate talent and courage staden appears to be doing the same here
grey is the maysles brothers bizarre documentary of jackie bouvier kennedy onassis'eccentric aunt and first cousin who live like pigs in a run down room mansion on east hampton long edie bouvier and dry and her daughter little edie about a still beautiful woman who once had a promising in isolation from the rest of the world except for their many cats and raccoons in the attic they amuse themselves by bickering all day listening to the radio or singing to each dont even own a television their fall from society is amazing to learn of and the viewer is drawn to these two very special although obviously dysfunctional of the better documentaries ever made and still a cult classic today
spirit is a unique and original look at western life from the point of view of a wild horse and native americans the film focuses on the friendships and perils that a wild horse spirit encounters during his well done in the presentation using the technology available today to deliver stunning visuals that are breathtaking in their depth and music is fantastic with songs by bryan adams and music by hans zimmer who also was responsible for the extremely popular music from the disney hit the lion story is not very deep but the fact that it isn't quite as in-depth as some movies doesn't in my opinion detract from the film as a excellent film which i enjoyed immensely and that is suitable for all the family not one to be missed
this was an exteremely good historical drama john turturro is excellent as the tortured genius luzhin and brilliantly portrays the manic affectations such as his strange dancing emily watson is fine in her support role as the sensitive lover relatonship between chess and near madness is well explored by gorris and familiar nabokov preoccupations such as eternal innocence lolita are evident in this film i think i will now go on to read the novel it was a touching and tragic ending and it was hard to keep a dry eye brilliant movie
this film revolves as much around japanese culture as it does the lives of one modern japanese family physical contact is frowned upon for those over in public hence all that bowing instead of hugging even when you are close relatives ballroom dancing involves putting your arms around someone else and that in public too never the less ballroom dancing is the quite immensely popular people who do ballroom dancing in japan are viewed a bit like nudists in the west many more would like to than do but are inhibited by the culture a delightful family film which any amateur dancer would enjoy for the dance sequences alone i understand that it was more popular than titanic in japan i guess the japanese are just like the rest of us they like to be hugged too
i've never laughed and giggled so much in my life the first half kept me in stitches the last half made me come completely unglued i think i giggled for minutes after the tape was timing and delivery for his stories is almost unequaled and though he talks fast you catch every joke which is probably why my laugh center was so overwhelmed it took an extra minutes to laugh at
how can a movie be both controversial and gentle this one does it with a near-perfect structure no one wants their daughters to be athletes apparently most cultures don't want their daughters to be small-breasted either here we see a bunch of superb actors we've never heard of before portray folks of different cultures living fairly humdrum lives until their female children want to and have the potential to become professional soccer players the structure around the parallelism of the two cultures is wonderful there is no condescension both cultures are seen as modern and valid yes both are silly too one flaw the hindu wedding ceremony seemed to involve hundreds of relatives but not one child among them
this has got to be one of my very favorite twilight zone episodes primarily for the portrayal of two lonely souls in a post-apocalyptic cobweb-strewn shops and rubble-laden streets are eerie in that particular way the twilight zone does the parable can be a bit heavy-handed by drama standards it is an excellent one using the setting to make a statement relevant to the human experience as well as geopolitics in a way that is timeless the entire drama rests solely on the shoulders of mr bronson and ms montgomery who do not disappoint they both rest in true classic
this film is a wonderfully simplistic work enjoyable from start to end it is both sad yet uplifting at the same time the performances from miranda otto how she deserves so much more george del hoya are beautiful and yet almost painful to watch as the two tortured souls come to understand each other the supporting cast of workers at the dead letter office are wonderful bit-parts in them selves as is long-suffering boyfriend who i couldn't help but feel slightly sorry for one particular scene i could watch over and over i have such a shame that films like these don't get recognition and therefore bring them futher into the public eye for more people to enjoy i cried i laughed and i sighed i'd recommend this film to anyone
i too was quite astonished to see how few people had voted on this film and just had to write something about it although my comments are quite similar to those written like many things about the film the superb acting between mastroianni loren the way the film is narrated humanity and love slowly developing between these two outsiders and contrasted to the simultaneously continuously ongoing inhumane marching pace of the fascist radio announcer happens to be a colleague of the adherents going to and coming from the show to me this is a very fine film about what it is to be human maybe some of you would argue that the anti-fascist message is too clearly delivered but to me this didn't destroy the film in any way my vote is
i also saw this upon its release in and have been struck since then with its final scene if this is an answer to high noon then an apt and apposite response the notion that as this string is headed the town comes together is a much stronger message than the lonely personal heroism of high noon in this theme concho is a phenomenal precursor of one my other all-time favorites the magnificent seven both sinatra and conrad give impressive and convincing performances especially transformation from bullying kid brother to liberating town savior i can only hope that at some point all the friends and family on whom over the years i've inflicted my affection for this movie will have the opportunity to experience it for themselves
my all-time favorite movie i have seen many movies but this one beats them all excelent acting wonderful story you will as a normal caring person start to love george altough he is an actor he is also himself and a very lovable person and maby most important thing you will learn to respect look different to people with down syndrome
the godfather citizen kane star wars goodfellas none of the above compare to the complex brilliance of the sopranos each and every character has layers upon layers of absolute verity completely and utterly three dimensional we care about tony soprano wholeheartedly despite the fact that in the simplest model of good vs evil he is evil soprano is the most provocative intricate and fascinating protagonist ever created to this point in history if you're in the mood to be overtly challenged as a viewer and to be forever altered on your feelings toward entertainment watch the sopranos i defy anybody to sit down and watch the very first episode of season and not want to continue with the series each season is completely brilliant in its own way dvds are essential to collection of out
la maman et la putain has to be watched as a movie that is both related to the time it was released and eternal in many respects true the actors don't act true they talk a lot but what they talk about is just what makes life worth living or dying the very long monologue spoken by françoise lebrun is perhaps the most accurate and moving text that was ever written about womanhood manhood and love not easy to translate accurately though this movie is a statement about the difficulty of being a man and a woman two women in this case and imho jean pierre léaud is one of the greatest french actors
ok there are people who should not see this don't see it if you don't like satire or black humour don't like it if you got offended by don't see it if you want a serious superhero rest of you run don't walk to see funny quirky a delightful sendup of every bad superhero cliche known to man occasional forays into junior-high humour don't ruin the tongue-in-cheek low-key fun of jeanane garafalo ben stiller and hank azaria as well as a couple of amusing smaller parts by geoffrey rush and greg kinnear to see louise lasser getting work too i laughed all the way through utterly unserious somewhat weird but
this movie is as unique as it is different story is just that it shows how out of the need to survive or maintain one can find the capacity to love if you have an open heart as well as an open mind i first saw this on cable in the late and it truly depicted the limitations of the gay community at the time i believe this movie was ahead of its time in depicting a little slice of an obscure way of life it is truly a classic in the sense that it was a precursor to what is now depicted as the extended family this film should be available on so that not only the extra ordinary performances of meg foster perry king can be acknowledged but to show how far we have come still have to go where relationships are concerned
just like wine johnny dangerously gets better and better with every day this clever witty well-acted film could very well stand on its own but as a parody of the gangster genre truly outstanding in fact quite obviously the best film of its kind the funniest spoof of mob movies and even the respective period although admittedly this position is probably easier to achieve when its main competitors are such primitive vulgar and dull pseudocomedies as jane mafia
this movie has everything that makes a bad movie worth watching sloppy editing little to no continuity insane dialog bad might even say non-existent acting pointless story lines shots that go on far too perfect for riffing not to mention the corpse eaters drinking game scribble on a shot sign your a shot catch a bad foley many many only reason i didn't rate it higher than is because not enough gratuitous nudity and because despite its insane badness only an hour long hell a movie like this should have been at least minutes longer
this is a bit of a puzzle for a lot of the artsy lynch crowd they tend to try to write this off as some kind of meaningless crude side project of like this is lynch passing gas between his real pieces of film art well it may be a fart but its one of those intriguing farts that you catch of a whiff of and are embarrassed to admit you distilled down beyond this is art what can you do with aspects of modern life but laugh at it if you took it seriously you would go nuts you hook into it smell it taste it feel its agonies its unreasoning stupidities and then express it in any medium you choose thats called art and art isn't dumb but it is dumbland
i first saw this film as a teenager it was at a time when heavy metal ruled the world trick or treat has every element for a movie that rocks with a cast that features skippy from family ties gene simmons of kiss and ozzy osbourne as a preacher how can you go wrong backwards evil messages played on vinyl yes thats right they use records in this movie in one scene eddie is listening to a message from the evil rockstar on his record player when things begin to get scary monsters start to come out of his speakers and his stereo becomes possessed as a teenager i tried playing my records backwards hoping it would happen to mine almost years later trick or treat is still one of my all time favorite movies
i have seen it i like it melissa plays her part well it was actually believable my brother in law saw it with my sister i and when i mentioned to my sister that i forgot it was based on a true story had seen it a few years ago he said just because its on lifetime you think its true both my sister i were like it was so anyway i was wondering if anyone knew what murder it was or like who was really involved was because i want to prove it to him i love lifetime movies especially the ones that are true or just the ones that teach a good lesson i thought i saw something about it a week ago but i cant remember where any help would be appreciated
new york i love you just like its predecessor je t'aime is a compound of various stories that reflects the different kinds and aspects of love but unlike it the rhythm is much faster and the stories much shorter the movie offers a unique view of the city of new york with its various and different landscapes new york i love you offers a first class cast featuring such great actors like shia labeouf natalie portman ian mckellen hayden christensen chistina rcci and orlando bloom ethan hawke james caan and robin wright penn among others and some excellent writers and directors like brett ratner and anthony mingella
once again the two bickering professors must join together to save the lost world the five members of the first expedition return the lost world for a list of actors a man seeking oil brings a drilling crew to the plateau instead of striking oil they tap an underground volcano which threatens all life in the lost world the oil crew clash with the native people and the scientific expedition although the situation looks hopeless not going to tell you the ending
imagine being so hampered by a bureaucracy that a one man spends of his life and has a mental breakdown trying to solve a mass murder case virtually by himself the murder technique is clear but a government unwilling to admit the truth a monster destroy dozens of lives when i think my job is stressful i merely remember the true story behind this wonder flick the devotion to duty of the main character was masterfully portrayed by rea the comic almost tragic at times relationship between rea and the sutherland character made this one of my favorite movies of the last years the catching of one of the worst mass murderers in history had me on the edge of my seat while not nearly as well advertised and talked about as silence of the the plot was just as suspenseful rent or buy this movie today
i won't repeat all that has been said already by other viewers of this my opinion this is an excellent film not only as a very human tale of the developing relationship between a father and his grown-up son but also as a little window onto the world of practising islam for those like me who are not very familiar with that important aspect of this story is that of the young relation to his beliefs and practices and how his attitude towards the religion seems to alter in subtle ways as we progress on their journey with is a very thought-provoking enjoyable and well-made film that i would recommend to anyone with brain and heart
i really love this movie i remember one time when i was in my teacher showed it to us on a film reel this movie however can be a little frightening for graders such as the scene where bill murders nancy and seeing face for the first time on the screen one of my relatives is sick of seeing this movie because she studied over it in music class if i were a teacher and could grade the people who produced this wonderful film i would give them an
my wife did not realize what a gem this movie was when she picked it up it is a story that shows real world success through hard work and is so refreshing in a world of violent movies not that i dis-like them but you have to love a movie that succeeds without it
but just as entertaining and random love it or hate it but don't expect a sophisticated plot or nail-biting cliffhanger think of it like seinfeld but without the follow-through and repeat performances of wacky characters far i have a feeling i will develop favourites as the season comforts is not for the faint of humour meant to be enjoyed with the least amount of effort on your part which is why this show embodies everything i need in a program when i get home from work in the evening superficial conversation in the background with just the right amount of cute to the characters for me to enjoy when i eventually look up from the computer to see what i'm than most of sitcoms calmer than an evening at nascar just the right mix of dead air and comebacks can't wait for the next one
this film was amazing it had an original concept of a vampire movie meets yakuza mob film it is a humorous and yet highly dramatic and tragic movie about friendship love immortality death and happiness and comments subtelly on society on the part of gackt camui the role of sho was excellently delivered and hyde was surprisingly good for his first film as the tortured yet humorous vampire kei i also laughed and cried at the happy-go-lucky character toshi who grew up with sho i loved each and every second of this this film especially moments such as the funny cigarette scene the fighting scenes and most of all the heartrenching ending
the mother is that extraordinary piece of film making it gets you thinking it pulls no punches and ultimately it leaves you thinking very much open-ended as to the lead fate anne reid i only knew briefly from her appearances in some victoria wood-led projects and thought a fine comedienne is truly superb here not the stereotypical widowed housewife that was perfect in marriage and motherhood at all and not all that free-spirited and adventurous at first she plays her character just with the right note that rings true it did to me powerful cast great script renaissance of european cinema indeed
love trap is a must see independent film when i sat down to watch the movie i came in with low expectations but left with a blessing the story is poetic substantive and creative the writer pulls you in further and further which each scene allowing you to relate to the realistic characters that every one can identify with the movie allowed me to reflect on my life and what i consider love to be the movie displayed what love really is action not emotion i was also impressed with the quality of the cinematography and the soundtrack of the movie the entire presentation surpassed my expectations i give the movie two big thumbs up and recommend it to everyone of all ages and all backgrounds
this is what i call a growth movie every character is different and better at the and all because one woman knows that the place they have chosen is a tub of love josie lawrence who is best known as a comedienne really shines as the woman who brings about all these changes even the men in this film go from being self-centered to better men the book stayed very true to the novel which is a plus in my book since i am a librarian the scenery breath-taking and the message of love genuine
did you know that anthony kiedis from the red hot chili peppers father is in this movie blackie dammit is father i noticed this after reading scar tissue autobiography and saw a picture of his father i thought well that guy kinda looks like that guy from that movie i saw in the eighties then i read more and it said his father was an actor that had a few small roles after checking this site and comparing with a search on the net i realized it really is his father in the movie funny because nowhere in the book does it mention him being in this movie perhaps his son was ashamed of his acting job in this flick but he need not be i think his father blackie did a great job in the show

the best of times is one of the great sleepers of all time the setup does not tax your patience the development is steady the many intertwined relationships are lovingly established the gags and bits all work and all are funny there is lots of sentimentality kurt russell playing reno hightower puts in one of his best performances and robin williams playing jack dundee is sure-footed as ever the cast also includes many great supporters wife is played by jack daughter who is lovely as is wife who is a great comedian i can't tell you how many times i've watched this movie how many times i have enjoyed it and how often i wish that more people could see it
i have seen this film only the one time about years ago and to this day i have always told people it is probably the best film i have ever seen considering there was no verbal dialogue and only thought dialogue i found the film to be enthralling and i even found myself holding my breath so as not to make any sound i would highly recomend this film i wish it was available on dvd

with such actors as ralph richardson raymond massey cedrick hardwicke and margaretta scott how can you go wrong very unusual scenics especially the modern ones the realization of the modern machinery is very effective here you have ray-gun blasts from building vehicles that help clear the area so new structures can be made although much younger in this film not very hard to figure out who the future mrs pumphrey from the bbc series all creatures great and small is going to be really effective reappearance of both raymond massey and ralph richardson the musical score is by the renowned swiss composer artur honegger and it is also unusual for the time it looks like they used really large sets or the effects make it seem that way lastly a really good story
we don't have to lose this movie this is one of the greatest i have ever seen jean pierre leaud is amazing than usual and the movie is one of the most unforgettable of the nouvelle vogue jean eustache is no more on this earth we just have this black and white images to remember one of the greatest and most subvalued french directors you just have to love this masterpiece i'll never forget sorry for the english
darius goes west is the touching story of a brave teen coping with muscular dystrophy and his personal quest to see the pacific ocean he receives help and encouragement from a group of young men who love and care for him while going on this story has a natural drama and honest portrayal of the commitment of young people to help one of their own stricken with this incurable who thinks young people are self-centered and narcissistic will find this movie to turn that stereotype on its head it is the power of the young people and their engagement with darius plight that is very compelling in this documentary
a sophisticated contemporary fable about the stresses that work to loosen and ultimately unbind the vows of marriage the main thrust of the narrative arises from a homily spoken by a country priest following the wedding vows of a young cosmopolitan couple from milan in it the future course of the marriage is spelled out which bit by bit frays from the stresses of modern life the moral of this story within a story is that in order for a marriage to work out both now and in the past it has been necessary for that relationship to be abutted by family and friends this film was a relative blockbuster by domestic italian standards a terrible shame that this film is not available in either dvd or vhs
when i saw this movie i was amazed that it was only a tv movie i think this movie should have been in theaters i have seen many movies that are about rape but this one stands out this movie has a kind of realism that is very rarely found in movies today let alone tv movies it tells a story that i'm sure is very realistic to many rape victims in small towns today and i found it to be very is something hard to find in other rape centered movies i also thought that tiffani theissen and brian austin green were awesome in the parts that they played i definitely recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys movies that have a bit of a harsh reality to them i enjoyed it very much
good movie good music good background and an acceptable plot but the main point again as his movies tend to be the man is the best actor in idia and can turn dust into gold nana patekar this may be his second best performance after others may disagree although other movies are not far behind one man that will never ever disappoint movie although i think shahrukh was a luxury this movie could have done without you can see in his movies others try very hard to reach his heights and act out of their skins but this man is really something movie is cool the music and direction is excellent plot a bit thin but the screen play and dialog again very good a must watch
all dogs go to heaven is in my opinion the best animated film ever made i'm not really a big fan of animated films but something about this one that makes it better than any other animated film i've seen the music is wonderful as is the performances of burt reynolds dom deluise and especially ken page as the king gator make music together is perhaps one of my favorite songs from any movie musical i've seen this is definitely a must see for people of all ages
than this what would happen if terry gilliam and douglas adams would have worked together on one movie this movie starts with a touch of brazil when at a certain point the story moves straight into the twilight zone bringing up nothing new but just nothing and nothing is great fun when dave and andrew starts to explore their new environment the movie gets really enjoyable bouncing heads well yes this movie was imho the biggest surprise at this like in cube and cypher natali gave this one a minimalistic weird but very special design which makes it hard to locate the place of the story or its time timeless somehow
this is one of my favorite govinda movies of all time and best film of david dhawan does a great job in directing this movie he makes it funny and adds family drama govinda is excellent as raja babu and gives a great performance karishma kapoor is an actress i hate this film she is a little less annoying but still annoys in some scenes kader khan is a maestro in acting and yet gives a superb performance aroona irani is terrific as the mother and gives a outstanding performance shakti kapoor is brilliant as nandu the sidekick this film has comedy action family drama and romance a full on entertainer
this is a thinking silly movie if you don't expect star wars and enjoy british humor this might just turn into a cult classic for you as it has for my wife and i from casting the voice of cary grant and jack nicholson as martians to the overly simplistic populace of big bean this is a movie that you can either sleep through or watch carefully and enjoy either not for everyone but if you enjoy relaxing easy humor that takes a quick mind to see the joke as it slips by you will enjoy this movie
i had watched several days film shooting of this movie that end result was just two scenes in the movie the location was sylvan lake in the black hills bring the the wagon etc so this dakota youth looked forward to seeing the movie and was not disappointed the local buffalo herd was being culled so the shooting scenes were for real doris animals were hurt during filming i think the ending was copied by jack nicholson in the shining a great comment from the this should be in the same class as high noon for real western drama or used as a social statement like blackboard jungle or rebel without a cause was for youth
bsg is one of my all time favourite tv series i was lucky enough to start watching it as the series came to final season it was a marathon from start to finish for me and what an incredible ride it was soon as i noticed the pilot on hulu i knew exactly what i was in for just by the title caprica although some things don't add up when you compare both series it is still beautifully executed there were no mention about the holobands in battlestar galactica or the mention of virtual worlds but maybe i haven't got far enough into the series for them to explain recommend this show to anyone who loves the universe technology and alternate fantasies of our world this show is very interesting and will have you wanting to watch more
the revenge is an unusual short not because of the subject matter or because animated mccay had introduced little nemo on film by this time but because it depicts bugs to tell the story ladislaw starewicz had originally wanted to film actual bugs fighting but couldn't get them to do it on camera because of the hot lights they suffered through so he took dead ones and started using stop-motion techniques to manipulate movements to his satisfaction this short does a good job of putting human characteristics on little creatures such as riding motorcycles painting filming kissing and dancing starewicz would also make frogland and the mascot but his first notable work would be this one if you're interested in this and the other shorts mentioned check your local library to borrow the dvd the cameraman't revenge and other fantastic tales from image entertainment
this movie has problems in its presentation may even be offensive to people who are looking for temporal and cultural faithfulness but it challenges the watcher to reflect on a variety of issues one of these is the nature and character of the relationship between jesus and judas another is that of the historical nature of the bible and faith and third is the humanity of jesus the tension of the christ-betrayer relationship is developed and held through the movie judas passion is presented as a darker parallel to that of christ when judas takes his own life the viewer can sense the angst denial and guilt however moving are not as powerfully portrayed as the judas drama chris sarandon offers a novel and provocative christ whether believable or not i would like to find this movie on dvd or even vhs to use in study or discussion groups
best movie ever this movie broke my ribs just by the force of laughter but it was well worth it i don't intend to do a summary of this excellent movie just go see it if you have the chance i think you will either love it or hate it the qualities of a real cult movie
gundam wing to me happens to be a good anime a bit slow moving around the middle of the series but over all enjoyable now before anyone jumps on my case and calls me a winger i will admit that i have watched all of the original gundam gundam and the ms team and gundam will admit that there were a few problems with the story telling and a few characters may seem to be rip-offs zechs marquise to the original char but this is an alternate universe show based on the original series as is you wish to view this series make sure that you watch the original gundam first and then know that you are watching an au series
a comedy of epically funny proportions from the guys that brought you south park and most of the guys from orgazmo this vulgur obscence movie has utterly disgusting eggotistical and satirical content it portrays incredibly cruel treatment of humans and animals i love it this is some funny stuff really funny two loser friends create a game in thier driveway which explodes into a national sensation corruption and greed and blackmail turn the sport sour and its up ta coop ta fix it and along the way you will laugh alot all there is enjoy
this film was in one word amazing i have only seen it twice and have been hunting it everywhere a beautiful ensemble of older screen gems who still have that energy judy denchs ability to carry the whole film was amazing her subtle chemistry with the knight in stolen armour was great
i remembered seeing this movie when i was a kid one day on the wonderful world of disney this movie has been in my memory for over years and i have been looking for it i would have to say that out of all the kids movies i saw back then this one stuck out more than all of them and after only seeing it once i really hoped i would get to see it again the story and images of this movie have been burned into my memory to this day i never did see it after that day back in the in fact i never remembered the title until an internet search earlier today disclosed it to me i loved it and want my kids to see anybody know where i can find it
the first series of lost kicked off with a bang literally and slowly decreased in pace this may have put some viewers off and people who started to watch halfway through would either be bored or just plain confused would advise people new to the world of lost to simply watch from the beginning and don't get pt off by the slower episodes the acting throughout is excellent but why have series planned why all this means is that there will be no answers for at least years oh well i'll keep watching if it keeps the tension up and dialogue flowing
unfortunately this film has long been unavailable other posters have noted but this is one of the essential dramas of the great depression a lyrical and touching drama of love set in a shanty-town it features performances by spencer tracy and loretta young that are just about the finest of their careers and a surpassing example of how the director frank borzage was able to create an almost fairy-tale aura around elements of poverty crime and horrendous social inequity which just proves that how truly romantic and spiritual his talents were this film shows how love survives amidst squalor and desperate need and it is totally life-affirming this is a real masterpiece of the period and is a movie that deserves to be more widely known
i have to tell you this is a great movie it surprises me sometimes how good a movie with no pretenses can be this one is just fabulous it could be that it isn't trying too hard to send any kind of message it just tells a whimsical fun story i gave it a out of
oh this is such a glorious musical a bit of miscasting frank sinatra is sorely miscast as the jewish nathan detroit though it only becomes evident on sue me which is a distinctly jewish song sadly the filmmakers decided to cut out one of the best songs from the show marry the man today and replaced it with an inferior sinatra showpiece with these two flaws in mind the movie is otherwise magnificent jean simmons shines as sarah brown marlon brando can't sing worth beans but pulls it off anyway stubby kaye wonderfully reprises his broadway role was written for him damon language and pacing and humor come through quite well this is on my see-it-every-chance-i-get list
i saw this film in the worst possible circumstance i'd already missed minutes when i woke up to it on an international flight between sydney and seoul i didn't know what i was watching i thought maybe it was a movie of the week but quickly became riveted by the performance of the lead actress playing a young woman child had been kidnapped the premise started taking twist and turns i didn't see coming and by the end credits i was scrambling through the the in-flight guide to figure out what i had just watched turns out i was belatedly discovering do-yeon jeon who'd won best actress at cannes for the role i don't know if secret sunshine is typical of korean cinema but i'm off to the dvd store to discover more
if you're a a fan of either or both chuck norris judson mills then this is the movie to has a lot of adventure in is a great follow up to chemistry between the main three personal movie along with the turned out so the networks should consider turning it into a regular you've seen recommend this movie for you've seen line in the sand but you haven't seen let me suggest that you will not be disappointed with either one
faithful adaptation of witty and interesting french novel about a cynical and depressed middle-aged software engineer something relying heavily on first-person narration but none the worse for that downbeat a petit-bourgeois sort of way philosophical and blackly humorous the best way i could describe both the film and the novel is that it is something like a more intellectual charles bukowski disrespect to cb intended mordantly funny but also a bleak analysis of social and sexual relations the great achievement is that it reflects real life in such a recognisable way as to make you ask why aren't other films like this one of the rare examples of a good book making an equally good film
this film is the best film jim carrey has ever made carrey did not have his usual face making stuff in this film he was both funny and sad carrey played a reporter named bruce nolan nolan blames freeman for everything that goes wrong in his life then god comes down from heaven and gives bruce his powers as i said before carrey did an excellent job i also thought that morgan freeman and jennifer aniston were great as supporting the plot was good because it had many subpoints in the main point this movie can be dog as well as break-up the script worked well too i am glad they made a sequel to this film i rate this film a
i thought how the grinch stole christmas was a pretty good wasn't horrible nor was it great but it was enjoyable to felt as if jim carrey got a little annoying at made the grinch seem like a special education person when all he needed to be was evil and devious but yet he turned out kind of did think the scenery when not inside the cave was beautiful and there was a few parts where i laughed but most of the time i thought it was just movie could've been so much better if they had changed the personality and they had included some more laugh scenes because most of the humor wasn't liked how the grinch stole christmas anyway but not anything to get excited about seeing

the straight story is the tale of an old man who decides to visit his sick brother who lives across the state line he decides to make the trip on his lawnmower as he can't drive and he wants to make the rip by himself the film beautifully depicts his journey and the lives he touches along the way farnsworth turns in a beautiful performance as do the rest of the cast most notably sissy spacek in an endearing performance as his daughter and harry dean stanton in a small but infinitely crucial first i felt that a story of an old geezer trip across the country side would be dull but i soon discovered that lynch with all the insights in to the man life makes this a movie i would recommend to anyone
one of the joys of picking up the recent bela lugosi collection is getting to see delightful movies like the invisible ray boris karloff and bela lugosi team up in a movie that delves into meteorites and radiation and while the science is all perfectly absurd the camera technique karloff as janos rukh uses to determine the site of a certain meteorite and downright laughable i didn't care in the lease because the movie is thoroughly enjoyable the effects are done well for the time the acting is great and the finish is particularly strong it reminds me of the pulp sci-fi comics and novels of the and complete with ray guns and ridiculous science you must watch this movie
during eddie stand up a women from the audience yells at eddie and a man from the audience responds what is said is women do mr rob is a character from saturday night live the man responds with shut up bitch unlike the previous post saying the women yelled do gumby this is incorrect although the post-er said he was there they must have a hearing problem despite what the post-er says about not being able to here it on dvd have a close listen as you actually can hear it on the dvd do mr rob i hope this helps anyone curious out the outburst cheers gaz
a patchwork about the stories from directors from countries are sometimes humoristic sometimes boring first one for example sometimes used to say to americans we have had more deaths than you and you supported the murderers sometimes really weird highly symbolic and interesting i really loved the claude lelouch live of a couple in new-york showing that our day-to-day problems are unimportant shoei imamura strongly anti-wars in general and idrissa ouedraogo typical african optimism despite terrible day to day misery and youssef chahine egyptian intellectual pro-peace having moral difficulties to accept the policy towards arab countries i am really pleased to see that many americans liked this movie it shows that we they i am still belgian but living in texas for years are still interested by other cultures and able to question past and present actions of our government like we should in a democracy
how much could the general hollywood director learn from this movie all when it comes to actually scaring people this movies truly shows that it is possible to really frighten and scare a viewer and that monstrous monsters and long knifes never will be the best way of achieving this all who love a real psychological thriller must see this movie it is the best of kind
i can't agree with any of the comments first time i saw the film on a uk tv channel it was presented as an indie film and if you take the film under this angle i think an all different matter i couldn't believe what i was seeing and got hooked instantly the plot may be as bad as a show there is no plot but the acting is wicked hilarious and all in all an incredible trash movie says as much about america than a bully or a ken park without the drama perspective but it gives a glimpse on the us society and more precisely on what afternoon tv viewers in america i believe there are plenty of them are interested in after all the neighbours we're talking about don't we fun
who knew they could be so funny christopher meloni and janel moloney are known more for their outstanding work in some of hottest dramas order svu and the west wing put them together on the big screen and what you get is an engaging romantic comedy with plenty of actors develop the ongoing relationship with impressive skill leaving the audience bound to fall in love with barry singer despite the fact a standup comic who also happens to be a mean-spirited sexist be rooting for him even as he takes all his insecurities with the opposite sex and chases thea halfway around the country in hopes of winning her heart they have so little in when barry finally opens his heart you'll wonder why thea keeps running souler opposite is a wonderful movie with an incredible cast and a gifted writer well worth your
this film though critically acclaimed has of course not yet been released in the on dvd like another great christine housekeeping out the same year but if you can support region this little masterpiece should be in your collection there are still some vhs copies available on the internet as is complemented by a great story as well as memorable performances from her supporting cast especially claudia carvan and the late great jan adele amazingly or maybe not this film and its stars went unacknowledged at academy awards time as did housekeeping but treat yourself to both of them you will be glad you did
i loved it so much that i bought the dvd and the novel at the same time the chemistry between the actors little arthur is amazing and could have used a bit more screen time for the yummy frederick lawrence by james purefoy and gilbert markham was amazingly on it from the very start of the movie one who most thrilled me via surprising shock and awe and wonder was rupert graves as arthur huntingdon i adore him in forsyte saga and all else i've seen him in but he outdoes himself here as arthur in my wildest dreams i could not have pictured him playing a demented psycho such as arthur huntingdon but he does and i love it and i love him
i was first introduced to eddie by friends from across-the-pond who know i like intelligent humor i prefer comedians who can be thought provoking while entertaining such as george carlin and dennis miller in dress to kill eddie provides the same type of social observation humor that stimulates your thoughts on a subject all the while causing your side to split at the same time there is a wide range of subjects in this stand-up and they are simply hysterical the piece on how to decide on stage name will leave you in andrew and catherine and do you have a flag
diane keaton has played a few heavy parts in her many years on the big screen but mostly known for the light and fluffy stuff with woody allen such as annie hall she deserves an oscar for best actress in a drama for this effort and it doesn't really matter what the competition was the year it was first shown try and find a scene in which she doesn't appear and it was all heavy drama exhausting in its pace and retakes action all at full speed the make-up made her as young as possible and she fit the age category even in close-ups but she was playing half her age and at a very fast pace the movie overall was fairly well done staged and shot well with a strong supporting cast but keaton carried the load
this movie has a lot of comedy not dark and gordon liu shines in this one he displays his comical side and it was really weird seeing him get beat up his training is unorthodox and who would've thought knot tying could be so deadly lots of great stunts and choreography very johnny wang in the mix and you've got an awesome final showdown don't mess with manchu thugs they're ruthless
as much as the movie was good i have nothing more to say about it than what was said already all i wanted is to point the fact that the movie isnt from sweden but from denemark maybe i wrong and in that case i'll be happy to know my mistakes so take the and notify me
the sarah silverman program is better than those other shows no laugh tracks no painful jokes just a program the sarah silverman program if you're like me and you love comedy this is probably a show for silverman brings out-there-funny and right-here-funny to the table with ease a mix of different styles which makes for its program isn't something you want to start a compare war with seeing as how it has absolutely nothing to do with them shows this show is its own entity and i think most comedy heads will like it just watch and see
i tuned into this by accident on the independent film channel and was riveted i'm a professional actor and i was flabbergasted by the performances they felt totally improvisatory absolutely without affectation i could not tell if it was scripted or how it was shot and waited until the very end to see credits and then spent a half an hour on the imdb to find this film do not miss it i see that the writer-director also did a very fine film called everyday people which i enjoyed a lot the shame of the film business is that projects this excellent do not get the distribution and advertising that they deserve and live under the radar this film deserves to be flown high and proudly i urge people to look it up and watch it
i hate over-long over-talky french movies but my favorite movie of all time is the longest and talkiest french movie of them all i saw it twice in the and then it disappeared but i finally got to see it again in and fell in love all over again what is most remarkable is that it feels every bit as fresh today as it did years ago if you haven't seen it don't miss your chance
paul was totally ripped off by someone at paramount who made dave the same story not as funny related to me this morning about the scene were sammy davis sings the new national anthem of parador he arrived in brazil after a long flight from vegas three planes car ride to the set etc he was beat he could hardly stand had to use a cane he was staying in a trailer about the size of my didn't know he could do it then he saw the crowd of bucks he came to life and they shot that scene for two hours he was magnificent then nearly is a great guy though very liberal a real talent
maybe just because i have an intense fear of hospitals and medical stuff but this one got under my skin the pun this piece is brave not afraid to go over the top and as satisfying as they come in terms of revenge movies not only did i find myself feeling lots of hatred for the screwer and lots of sympathy towards the screwee i felt myself cringe and feel pangs of disgust at certain junctures which is really a rare and delightful thing for a somewhat jaded horror viewer like myself some parts are very reminiscant of hellraiser but come off as tribute rather than imitation a heavy handed piece that does not offer the viewer much to consider but i enjoy being assaulted by a film once and awhile this piece brings it and doesn't appologize i liked this one a lot do not watch whilst eating pudding
my cable tv has called the arts channel which is a catch-as-catch-can situation sometimes sometimes films sometimes short clips of films or ballets and i came into this just as the bar scene came on where they tear up their coupons excellent exquisite ealing wins again my wartime-glasgow-raised mother would love this should i ever find a copy of it some of best artists from mr holloway to wayne and radford and the delicious miss rutherford having a wonderful time gently sticking it to the home office loved the last scene where as soon as they are back in england the temperature plummets and it rains
there are way too many subjects avoided in cinema and eating disorders is one of them this film shows it as it is it is not glamourised for the viewers to enjoy it is shown with real truth which makes it all the more powerful i've only seen it once and that was a few years ago but i can still remember everything about it and how it made me feel it is a very powerful film and is good support for anyone suffering from a eating disorder to give them the willpower to stop this is what films should be they should be there to help people and not glamourise things that are wrong
though not in the whole film andy griffith again plays his role best in this cbs tv-movie the plot is character dies and his last wish is that his wife and kids scatter his ashes is the place he named somewhere though it will never be seen on tv and never be released on video if you do get the chance to watch it
i totally agree that nothing is a fantastic film i've not laughed so much when watching a film for ages and david hewlett and andrew miller are fantastic in this they really work well together this film may not appeal to some people can't really say why without spoiling it but each to their own i loved it and highly recommend directing is great and some of the shots are very clever it looks as though they may have had a lot of fun when filming there are really only main characters in the film and not an awful lot of props the actors manage to pull it off and make the film enjoyable to watch
i can't believe people are looking for a plot in this film this is laural and hardy lighten up already these two were a riot their comic genius is as funny today as it was years ago not a filthy word out of either mouth and they were able to keep audiences in stitches their comedy wasn't sophisticated by any stretch if a whoopee cushion can't make you grin no reason to watch any of the stuff these guys did it was a simpler time and people laughed at stuff that was funny without a plot i guess it takes a simple mind to enjoy this stuff so i qualify two man comedy teams don't compute we're just too sophisticated aren't we fortunate
this film is fantastic finally well-written characters you can love for all their good and bad pierce brosnan is flat-out hysterical in this self-effacing role i think its the best thing ever done done other roles that exhibited shades of being capable of this kind of fully-fledged work but this role finally gave him the room to run with it i almost died when he walked across the hotel lobby in his underwear and boots and greg kinnear and hope davis are a couple to aspire too as well as actors to aspire too kinnear is so goofy likable that his turn in the end is truly gratifying you give good actors good work to play with and they give us something more back
green eyes is a great movie in todays context of supporting our troops it is interesting this movie showed the lack of respect soldiers received from doing their duty during this period from a historical view the end of the vietnam war left all of us with something to remember and learn from gene was very proud of this movie and he deserved the credits he received from writing green eyes i agree i do not understand why this movie is not shown more often or at all this movie is the kind of movie that should be shown on tv every year much like the wizard of oz the dedication of one man towards his lost son is entirely moving i was a friend of gene logans and i was proud to know him rocky
this was the funniest piece of i have ever witnessed bar none i laughed myself sick the first three times i watched it i recommend it to everyone with the warning that if they can't handle the f-sharps to stay far away at his best when telling stories from a kids point of view
care bears movie a new generation isn't at all a bad movie in fact i like it very much yes i admit the dialogue is corny and the story is a bit poorly told at times but darkheart while very very dark is a convincing enough shape shifting villain and hadley kay did a superb job voicing him speaking of the voice acting it was great nothing wrong with it whatsoever the animation is colourful and some of the visuals particularly at the beginning were breathtaking the songs and score are lovely especially growing up and forever young the latter has always been my personal favourite of the two the care bears who i do like are adorable and the human children are well done too and the ending is a real tearjerker all in all harmless kiddie fun bethany cox
a hit at the time but now better categorised as an australian cult film the humour is broad unsubtle and in the final scene where a bbc studio fire is extinguished by urinating on it crude contains just about every cliche about the traditional australian pilgrimage to the old country and every cliche about those rapacious stuck up whinging tory brits would be acceptable to the british because of its strong cast of well known actors and to australians of that generation who can get the humour americans forget it the language and jokes are in the australian dialect of english and as such will be unintelligible
the first and second seasons started off shakily with good episodes sandwiched in between average ones and at times resorting to clichéd stories but once it started to set up the universe in which it exists and started to develop characters more it became a lot more fun and entertaining main reason this show succeeds it because of four men richard dean anderson peter deluise joseph malozzie and paul mullie dry sense of humour makes to show so much better directing is excellent and makes any episode so much more entertaining and joe paul never fail to make a funny interesting episode together you understand what the show is about and get to know the characters i doubt you won't like the show for those getting into the show i suggest the episodes the other side a good serious episode and window of opportunity a classic comic relief episode
as a long time red sox fan i just had to go see the movie it was great while there can never be enough live footage from the miracle red sox season there were great shots of some of my favorite red sox players while the movie is certainly a chick flick it has enough baseball footage from the amazing red sox comeback to make it one of my top movies of all time i especially enjoyed the red sox fans that were part of baseball family the scene where ben is meeting with his buddies on draft day to determine who will get seats to certain games is hilarious a must see if you are looking for a wholesome movie to watch with your spouse date or significant if you are a baseball even more especially if you are red sox fan
it helps immensely if one is familiar with the culture and time period in which this film takes place first of all these ladies are not geisha they are oiran the yoshiwara-type green houses circa give or take this should help clear up some details which may be confusing to the unaware the film deals with issues of loyalty love and perhaps most importantly how people deal with adversity both their own and that of others in their immediate environment that plus the outrageous photography together with the hauntingly beautiful music make for a lovely ride just plug it in suspend your disbelief and enter their world you won't be disappointed
gena rowlands plays an actress who loses her grip on reality when she witnesses the death of a fan of hers she becomes increasingly deluded from reality and as a result her emotional turmoil intrudes with her work as an actress in the sense that she breaks all the rules of acting and improvises everything yet still manages to engage her audience makes the film interesting a bit self-important as a parallel of cassavettes own struggles as a filmmaker so many ideas thrown around and as result it becomes a bit muddled still pondering the relation between the dead fan and rowlands among many other things but the way they're presented in their rawest form makes it a consistently interesting and thought-provoking film would be great on a double bill with mulholland
bromwell high is nothing short of brilliant expertly scripted and perfectly delivered this searing parody of a students and teachers at a south london public school leaves you literally rolling with laughter vulgar provocative witty and sharp the characters are a superbly caricatured cross section of british society to be more accurate of any society following the escapades of keisha latrina and natella our three protagonists for want of a better term the show doesn't shy away from parodying every imaginable subject political correctness flies out the window in every episode if you enjoy shows that aren't afraid to poke fun of every taboo subject imaginable then bromwell high will not disappoint
bar some of the questionable acting musicians at the end of the day this in the words of quentin tarrinno is the best rock movie ever mile but without the rapping a young musician trying to prove himself to the local community whilst struggling to cope with a broken home and a rival band throw in the sex interest and the truly exceptional performances this is the real provides a solid performance as does morris day and jerome benton decent script good direction great plot and spectacular performances not forgetting the some of the best music you will ever hear
good funny straightforward story excellent nicole kidman almost always like the movies in this was a good vehicle for someone adept at comedy and drama since there are elements of both a romantic comedy wrapped around two crime stories great closing lines chaplin very good here was also good in another good but unpopular romantic comedy about cats dogs maybe they're too implausible ebert didn't even post a review for this the great screwball comedies obviously were totally implausible up baby etc if you've seen one implausible comedy you've seen them all or maybe people are ready to move on from the weird birthday girl is a movie i've enjoyed several times nicole kidman may be the killer app for home video
some movies you just know you're going to love from the first few seconds this is one of those movies tracing roots back to double indemnity and the postman always rings twice in the this was a great example of modern film noir in the nick cage plays the down on his luck main character who gets entangled in a husband-wife murder plot and his luck goes from bad to worse to even worse as he tries and tries to get away from the people town violence and threat of red rock west lots of twists and turns great performances by cage hopper and walsh an hypnotic slide-guitar musical backdrop and seamless directing make this a real joy favorite line when cage looks at the empty gas gauge in the get-away car shakes his head and says story of my life
this is one of the most calming relaxing and beautifully made animation films i've ever seen with beautiful music throughout the movie the sounds and music can make you feel like you're in the movie this movie is not just great for kids but adults too it teaches you lessons such as never forget who you are you can do whatever you stick your mind to and to brave and daring this movie can make you cry at times too which is always a nice touch in movies this movie is funny sad cute and keeps you on the edge of your seat some movies really give you a fuzzy feeling after you see them and the movie spirit is definitely one of them with my vote of stars for animation music and a wonderful idea for a movie it gave me a whole lot of spirit
this episode apparently grew out of the cold war there has been a holocaust but somehow elizabeth montgomery and charles bronson have come through unscathed it then becomes a battle for turf she is attracted to him and vice versa but the instinct for survival takes over a quiet slow moving chess battle as they attempt to achieve trust they come to truces but distrust takes over and they start again of course the male female role of the sixties comes into play and modern viewers might find that her need to follow him is a bit offensive but it still is captivating and interesting because she doesn't speak we don't know here mind very well but in the end we can guess
why this movie has all but disappeared into obscurity is an absolute crime conan is perhaps the only sword and sorcery movie better the brutal violence cool character designs and good pacing make this one of the best fantasies around it is certainly the greatest animated movie aimed at a more adult audience that i have ever seen this is not similar to usual frenetic style quite a departure for bakshi and in my opinion his best work i hope that this film gets the recognition it deserves
la teta i la luna breast and the moon describes the life of a year old boy named tete who is obsessed with breasts growing up in catalunya i love this movie because the characters are very honest and very human like all the characters in bigas movies director of jamon jamon tete reminded me of how intriguing and exciting life can be at that age also being from catalunya of spain it brought lots of memories to my mind this movie shows how beautiful catalunya is nice people nice life and specially lots of non-uptight people
to like this movie at most you must be in love a marriage b acknowledge english humor which is about admiring gallant and witty life situations and not just running gags c be fairly very intelligent because authors gave an opportunity to laugh and cry over every single minute of this movie and only if you meet b and c requirements you can recognize and enjoy input d to fully enjoy the movie you must love women like kirsted dunst who is so natural sweet and irresistible must admire creative a little melancholic people with great and remarkable you meet all these requirements you'll be likely to rate this movie near never laughed as much as from watching this masterpiece and i even managed to cry while laughing in some moments always get sensitive whenever good things happen to kirsten dunst
i just purchased and viewed the dvd of this film the dvd transfer is from last year this film is really a great little film overlooked by most people i saw it in the theater in and have loved it ever since i love the opening shot of pittsburgh baltimore as another user commented makes pittsburgh look like one of the most beautiful cities in the world and i must say the tour of pitts on the garbage truck with nicky is a very scenic interesting one tom hulce as everyone else has said gives a remarkable wonderful performance the dvd is a good transfer with no extras but a widescreen format i recommend it to those who love the movie
i really enjoyed this movie britney is an excellent role model for teens and should be more appreciated this movie is about following your dreams and never giving up no matter what people might do or say to discourage and criticize you holly fulfills her dreams just like britney are times in everyones lives when people judge them for what they are not who they are watching this movie will make you understand that you are special in your own way and that you should follow your dreams no matter what happens would like to thank britney for encouraging me and my friends to follow our dreams she will never know how much that means to me bravo britney you are the greatest
people claim its edited funny but they had to cut it down substantially in post production i have harry as a professor right now at ucsd and honestly its one of the best classes i've had its rather funny to here about what happened in making the film cause harry is so animated i originally watched joy of life for another class where harry did a voice over in the film and started watching this film after i started the class harry originally did some performance work and is really genuine about creating moments that move you especially when you have to re edit things until you hit on that moment but its something you see in this film
this was excellent touching action-packed and perfect for kurt russel i loved this movie it deserves more than or so stars this movie is the story of an obsolete soldier who learns there is more to life than soldiering and people who learn that there is a time for fighting a need to defend i cried laughed and mostly sat in awe of this story good writing job for an action flick and the plot was appropriate and fairly solid the ending wasn't twisty but it was still excellent if you like escape from new york or rooting for the underdog this movie is for you not an undue amount of gore or violence it was not difficult to watch in that respect something for everyone
this movie is a great the plot is very true to the book which is a classic written by mark twain the movie starts of with a scene where hank sings a song with a bunch of kids called when you stub your toe on the moon it reminds me of song high hopes it is fun and inspirational the music is great throughout and my favorite song is sung by the king hank crosby and sir saggy sagamore overall a great family movie or even a great date movie this is a movie you can watch over and over again the princess played by rhonda fleming is gorgeous i love this movie if you liked danny kaye in the court jester then you will definitely like this movie
it was by accident that i was scanning the tv channels and found this wonderful film about two beautiful human beings who become attracted to each other in a very innocent and virgin like approach to each other ethan hawke tape and julie delpy er tv series this gal and guy will warm your very heart and soul and make you think deeply into your past relationships and how you really wish you had followed your hearts strings with a guy or gal you deep down loved and lost track of over the years jesse and celine have great conversation and deep eye contact with a great magnetic explosion between the two of them i am looking forward to the sequel to this film in and if you have viewed this film you will feel the same way
an old man who lives in the mountains wakes up one morning and loses his cat he wanders the woods to witness a murder but did he see the murder or is he losing his mind is he just getting old the movie so great because the viewer has to make up their own mind on what is going on there is very little dialog in this movie but it doesn't need words the whole movie speaks for itself you knew what was going on and i liked other part that i liked were the shots of the woods in late fall and winter those were pretty but the only thing i didn't like was the view of the old man in his underwear he could have tied the robe a little tighter but other than that it was a pretty deep movie
what can i say about a tale such as this this magical tale has followed me from my early warm memories in my characters take you to to so many whimsical places making you want more of each scene for example in the market there were so many different flavors of lore i loved the exotic dancers that accompanied the steel story line was wanted so badly for landsbury to decide to keep the precocious children and for her to also stay with find the other half of the spell so that the men less armor could win the am still a child this movie appeals to my inner child like no other this movie is my definite favorite of all times i hope that all children will be able to watch this classic and be swept transported into another time
again stacy peralta is true first to the people who lived the story by letting those involved in the genesis of big wave surfing tell us their stories how it felt and what they thought you get the feeling of having been there the film carries you from the fifties to the near present by focusing on three primary architects contributing to the evolution and development of the sport candid home movie like videos of themselves and their contemporaries take you further into their world the layers of music culture technical pure view of the athleticism and fabulous big wave images you get a full scope perspective of this aspect of worth watching
my very favorite character in films but in nearly all of them the character of zorro has a small bit of cloth as a mask and if the tell who is under that cloth then they are in reed fighting legion the mask fills his whole face making it a real mystery as to who zorro really anyway zorro is one of the best in films and to bring it up to date l think anthony hopkins in the mask of zorro is a interest in films is vast but l have a real liking for the of the
what i love about this show is that it follows the lives of modern witches and a blast to experience their everyday love humor and adventure the literature of magic is so diverse portraying the ideas of classical medieval and modern wizardry like harry potter and sabrina with sabrina the teenage witch this show is so fun and unique because it lets us experience a lot of that modern wizardry seven seasons worth this show has so many great qualities and a joy to watch sabrina live her daily life in the mortal and other realm i would recommend this to any family because the television series is clean funny and adventurous classic
tiempo de valientes is a very fun action his great fist movie called el fondo del mar and the spectacular tv pro-gramme los szifron made another great de valientes movie made in peretti and luis luque are two great actors and have great movie is very fun and funny and it has superb de valientes is a very fun action comedy that i totally recommend if you wanna have a great i have to congrats szifron for all the talent he
a very good movie not only for the fans of lady death comics but also for those who like animated of adventure and film is about a innocent girl who is about killed for something she hadn't done but for be who she is daughter of the ruler of hell lucifer she seeks the rest you better see it from the liked the movie a lot the characters are like the original comics form chaos i never had the chance of read the the first parts of the story in comics only the last ones after the passages in the movie so i cannot tell you if the events are exactly like the comics way or another the story of lady death
bette midler showcases her talents and beauty in diva las vegas i am thrilled that i taped it and i am able to view whenever i want to she possesses what it takes to keep an audience in captivity her voice is as beautiful as ever and will truly impress you the highlight of the show was her singing stay with me from her movie the rose you can feel the emotion in the song and will end up having goose bumps the show will leave you with the urge to go out and either rent a bette midler movie or go to the nearest music store and purchase one of bette albums
this movie is a lot better than the asylums version mainly its war of the worlds the tripods look pretty cool but their walking and deaths could have been better the action scenes were really cool walking oh my god stop walking please or i'm going to kill myself the thunder child scene was my favorite sequence mainly because a ship rammed bunch of tripods good movie i recommend it for people ho have read the book the music is awesome and the directors cut looks pretty good soundtrack to the book cool violence tripods and handling machines are cool to look some bad acting cheesy looking london
this is what i call a great movie it lives trough the fantastic actor skills and a simple but human story there are real characters which can be funny and dramatic but the main theme is very cruel like live bus driver and his son are collecting people trough the country on their way to the capital belgrad the funny and cruel situations that happens on the way connect the people and the pigs that travel together it and you gonna remember it for life its filled with slavic humor and another reason for its magic it is hard to get
when i heard that adrian pasdar was in drag in this movie my expectations that i would watch the entire movie were low the only reasons i gave it a chance were the magnificent julie walters and the recommendation of a i thought would be a broad mrs doubtfire type of farce turned out to be a gentle and insightful comedy pasdar is entirely credible and empathetic as the ambitious business man who needs to release the female part of his being by cross-dressing on occasions he transmits these needs to the audience in a thoroughly believable fashion julie walters is magnificent is as her habit as the landlady who teaches him unconditional love
i know crude and i know that it isn't at all pc but so funny if you can put it into perspective that from the early and it carries all the stereotypes of the the movie still makes you almost pass out with it is truly a good comedy going with the tradition of what comedies have been for thousands of years the subject matter of this film is exagerated if you can suspend your political correctness for an hour and a half just to have an all-out laugh than please watch would someone please put this out on dvd so hard to find on vhs anymore
a rather good movie but too americanised in predictability change the kung fu for football and the turkish family for a pakistani one and you get to watch bend it like beckham almost scene for scene a nice feature the serves as the backbone of the movie is the progression of fights with the mysterious ninja under the highway beginning with miserable losses and slowly progressing until the last fight is a win against oneself as the kung fu master stressed several times on a different level the danish life is revealed quite different than the image it has by outsiders the non indigenous immigrants that make a large proportion the majority of the danish citizenry the graffiti in the copenhagen suburbs the taunting of the immigrant girl in the begging of the movie all portray a different picture than one has in mind when one hears the word denmark
doghi is a wonderful movie and renuka daftardar is excellent so is uttara baokar who is usually excellent in most of her roles along with kairee its an example of marathi cinema at its best there are certain parts in both movies that tend to the didactic it would have probably enhanced the movie to not have the few scenes where the social message is hammered in these scenes probably emerge from the political concerns but the movie is realistic and moving enough to not need it but apart from such minor quibbles its a movie that deserves to be seen more and one i strongly recommend sumitra concern and humanism shines through
the day time ended is an incredible picture in some ways better than close encounters of the third kind prefer cheesy independent flicks to big budget spectaculars the special effects are cheesy but a big part of the fun jim davis gives an excellent performance in this film probably one of the best roles he ever had in a feature the musical score is very good the story doesn't make sense but that only makes it all the more intriguing like many of the best works of art the day time ended isn't afraid to be subtle and ambiguous the day time ended may be a low budget indie film but it isn't too much of a stretch to compare it with the existential european films of the fifties and sixties of which were low budget independent productions themselves
rob roy is and underrated epic of passion and mild spoilers within liam neeson gives a towering performance as rob roy of the best in his lange is letter-perfect as his wife have the most passion and chemistry i've seen in a screen hurt gives his best snotty aristocrat roth portrays one of the great screen rape of mary is repugnant and really is a magnificent bastard in this final duel between rob and cunningham is one of the best swordfights scripted ans michael caton-jones direction is flawless out of
while urban cowboy did not ooze with the same testosterone you might find at a rodeo it did provide an accurate glimpse of that day and age in urban texas i also think that to truly critique this movie one would have to have lived in the time and relative place that it was made there was good music fun times and yes a few rough and tumbles at the honky tonk roadhouses the relationship of bud and sissy like two ships passing in the night was well conceived when pam tore up the note that sissy had written to bud it echoed the tragedy of many true life romances the entire story was well thought out i thought the cast and crew did an excellent job i thought the screen play was well written and directed scott glenn should have received an oscar for best supporting actor
one of best films that i can enjoy watching often you may easily guess the outcome but who cares its just plain fun escape for hour forty-two minutes and after all wasn't movies meant to get away from reality for just a short time anyway the cast sparkles with delight
if your a fan of airplane type movies this is a must see set in the and johnny dangerously has not only great actors but great lines knock down dat down dat wall and knock down dat wall you shouldn't hang me on a hook johnny or sounds like johnnys getting laid its definitely a spoof of the old james cagney movies and references them a lot a great scene when jhonnys walking down death row and has a priest set up for his escape listen closely to the fake priests readings its pretty funny another great scene is when dom delauise plays the pope watch his reaction to johnny after he tips the pope a lot said without making a recommend this movie to all who love to laugh or are old movie buffs
the film had many fundamental values of family and love it expressed human emotion and was an inspiring story the script was it was very easy to understand making it perfect for was enjoyable and humorous at times there were a few charged symbols to look for the cinematography was acceptable there was no sense of experimentation that a lot of cinematographers have been doing quiet frankly is getting a little warn out it was plainly filmed but had a nice soft quality to it although editing could have been done better i thought it was a nice movie for a family to enjoy and the organization of information was just thrown at you which was something i didn't like either but in all it was a good movie
i found this film by mistake many years ago wondered then do why it didn't get the acclaim it should have well written beautiful acting one ironic twist after another and there is plausibility in what the nefarious characters are attempting i would not recommend this film for people with short attention spans it requires sufficient intelligence to comprehend that there maybe a kernel of truth in this story
visually stunning and full of eastern philosophy this amazing martial arts fantasy is brought to you by master director tsui hark the man behind some of the best films hong kong cinema has produced the special effects are beautiful and imaginative the plot is a bit on the cerebral side but is a refreshing change from films that treat their audience as if they were morons if thinking is not your forte however this may not be your movie maybe you should go see the latest from the hollywood no brain club but if you are looking for something more where you will find it
i don't believe this was an acting challenge for richard harris this was an uncomplicated plot yet interesting it is a good movie to watch when you don't want to do a lot of thinking just want to be told a simple story the canadian scenery was breathtaking the beautiful fall shots alone made the picture worth seeing
plenty has been written about the house of games most of it good i decided to revisit the flick to see how it held up after years and was surprised at how much i enjoyed viewing it again the success and durability probably has much to do with two principal ingredients which are always fun on film a good story and a good scam mamet manages to bring his signature moodiness and obvious histrionics to the film while scamming us the audience and the mark simultaneously then he explains the art of conning only to do it again etc all the while building the story the house of games now a freebie on cable is worth a look for first timers and an okay rerun for mamet fans
unheralded classic is a film unlike just about any other a film that has the feel of a fairy tale but has a solid grounding in reality due to its use of authentic manhattan locations and true geography perhaps the best location filming in nyc i've ever seen john ritter reminds us that with good directors blake edwards billy bob he can be brilliant and the entire ensemble is a group you'll wish truly existed so you could spend time with one of the few romantic comedies of the last years that doesn't seem to be a rip-off of something else this is the high point of fertile success career when his best work was truly done jack at long last noises off
very entertaining and a great cast as noted i'd like to add that bruce dern did a fine job also as is usually the case worth renting if you can find it which has proved difficult for me also note that the amazon link from this page currently goes to a different movie of the same name
tom the cat jerry the mouse and spike the dog called butch his third name his second being killer decide to sign a peace treaty to all love each other weird and a bit unnatural seeing them all buddy buddy like this and their seem to think so too but by the end thanks to a disagreement over a steak everything is back to normal and all is how it should be this short is the second one of three on the new spotlight dvd to be edited and i have no clue why this one was this cartoon can be found on disc one of the spotlight collection dvd of tom jerry grade b
this movie is one of the most provocative jesus movies i have ever seen it does not seek to tell the whole story but only to portray an interpretive expression of the last day of jesus christ it is darkly witty playful and seriously faithful to elements of the jewish tradition and to modern scriptural interpretation judas is much more ordinary than other portrayals not the dark and sinister evil that we sometimes imagine but a grossly mistaken man horribly misguided in his zeal chris jesus is playful and serious faithful and human while also divine the final dialog is thoughtfully done and serves as the kind of small talk that two powerful men might do when they have just committed an atrocity i would watch this movie again and recommend it to others
yes right it is i firmly believe that the and the weird looking controller were both designed just so this game could be made it was amazing the first time i saw it with its huge environments and colorful characters and its amazing now the play control is perfect the graphics are beautiful and it has that nintendo charm that is always so intangible but undeniably there a must have for any owner and a reason to get an for everyone else
my husband and i enjoy the doodlebops as much as our month old baby does we have bought him and just so we can watch and listen to them ourselves they are fun energetic and very entertaining they encourage children to be active share and care they always have a positive message along with fun entertainment every time our son hears the theme song he quickly turns his head toward the television and starts bouncing up and down in excitement dee dee is a wonderful singer she has a great voice moe is a great dancer i would recommend the doodlebops to anyone with children our favorite song is the bird song you just can not help but smile and want to dance when you hear it
this movie is so misunderstood it is not even funny if you think of seeing this one for the shootings stay clear this one deals with the effects and trauma that the survivors must endure even the detectives are seeking the answer we all fantastic acting from the two leading ladies as we see how those we ignore are affected by the very same things we are affected with yes the language is harsh at times but it suits the characters well there are some loose ends left or unanswered but all movies have these the major issues are dealt with and this movie makes a major statement about how all of us adults feel after such major incidents highly recommended for teens and adults
nicolas mallet is a failure a teller in a bank everyone walks all over him then his friend a writer books no one likes has a plan to change his life our hero tells his boss he is quitting he intends to spend the rest of his life making a great deal of money and sleeping with a great many women and he manages to do just it were not for the amount of death causes in the film this would be a farce there are numerous jabs at marriage politics journalism trintignant is a likable amoral rogue romy schneider is at her most appealing definitely worth a look
always enjoy the great acting of drew barrymore and her great performance in this film where she plays a very very complicated young who leaves new york and travels to california and shares an apartment with a up and coming writer george many strange things start to happen to holly and she seeks to find her brother in a mental institution after he killed her father if you look close enough you will actually see the mother of drew barrymore in real life appear as her mother in this picture if it was not for the good acting of drew barrymore and george newbern this film should be seen only on halloween night however it sure has surprises in the end
i thought that this was an absolutely charming movie centering around the lives of and characters sam and emma stanton they are both trying to make both themselves and their parents happy but unfortunately just not that easy for them to actually do i thought that this was an utterly charming and sweet movie and if you are a real fan of these marvelous young ladies then i'm sure that you'll agree with me here if you haven't seen this movie yet then i say you really missed-out big time and that you should definitely take the time out to see it now this movie is a real winner sincerely rick morris
ruth gordon at her best this episode is my favorite of the whole columbo series peter falk and ruth gordon worked so well together that they should both be inducted into the television hall of fame regardless of the rest of their work even the music was outstanding in this episode
i have watched this episode more often than any other tftc episode it is that enjoyable and it is quite scary but all in good ghoulish fun a woman kills her husband but runs into a problem when an escaped maniac in a ragged santa claus outfit decides to pay her and her little girl a visit at that very moment mary traynor who i seem to remember from snl or some other tv comedy skit show is the evil wife and larry drake plays the lunatic in the dingy santa outfit i had forgotten santa was played by drake over the years his santa is an unstoppable force and quite frightening at times you can probably guess how santa finally gets into the house the episode is played for laughs but it also can be pretty intense at times
this show is about three little girls stephanie and michelle their mother is killed by a drunk driver so their father danny invites his brother-in-law and his old so the whole show is about living life the girls go through troubles and have life lessons they develop crushes boyfriends and many more the whole show is basically about to go with the flow you do not have to hold grudges you just have to let it go i think this show is really good and fun to watch i grew up watching this show and still watch it today i am glad they still air this show on television i watch it almost every day i rate it
i was living rawlins when this movie was made and i got lucky enough to be able to work on it both as an extra and with eddie surkin on special effects it was fun to see all the behind the scene workings from the barbedwire coming alive to the electric chair up through the wardens office floor also it was a lot of fun getting to meet all the actors from viggo to tiny also the gate that was cut into the prison wall for the movie was and still is called disney gate by locals if anybody is interested and is ever in rawlins most of the movies sets are still in place and can be seen during the self guided tour it was a lot of fun working for and with r harlin and wished i had a chance to do it again
this movie is the best movie ever it has a lot of live action just great everyone should watch it and the actor are great the location is rome italy thats the best place ever the actors are great mary-kate olsen is such a great actress she plays charlie and thats a great character and ashley olsen play leila and thats a great character to love when in rome love it
i saw this film at the taos film festival last year and was just overwhelmed by it a rich warm novel brought to the screen beautifully acted and well directed more than anything it reminded me of the films of david lean both in its ability to handle a complex story and its knack for creating powerful scenes that affect you on several different levels the best movie i've seen in years
winchester is a great story and what i like about it not your everyday uses a rifle which passes hands from various a mechanism for telling the story about these people rock hudson plays an indian chief jimmy stewart plays a great leading man with heart and strength and shelly winters plays a gal who has to cope with the realities of her husband and the wild west important to note for those politically correct kill a lot of indians in this movie without remorse by standards still pretty violent but a great story and worth watching enjoy
pickup on south street directed by movie maverick samuel fuller contains a stunning opening that establishes a double complication subway rider candy peters collides with pickpocket skip mccoy widmark dipped in shades of sinatra cool unaware that she carries valuable microfilm mccoy is unaware of grifting it both are unaware of being observed by two federal agents thus the grift sets in motion a degree of knowledges candy is doubly watched and the police and therefore doubly naive skip the overconfident petty thief is singularly unaware trailed by federal agents the feds all knowing are ultimately helpless they can't stop the passing of government secrets or the spread of communism
soylent green i found to be an excellent you like run you'll like the movie is old and there are no special effects and some of the acting can somewhat be best described as cheesy but the story is story of how the world can be and its impact on society is very the end the mystery wasn't a mystery but the story unfolded in an easy at the right nearest modern day equivalent would be dark angel in terms of how the us is shown to be third-world country
this movie has everything emotion power affection stephane adorable naked beach dance it exposes the need for real inner communion and outer communication in any relationship just because cedric and mathieu are a couple who happen to be gay doesn't mean there isn't quite useful insight for anybody in it i would probably classify it as a gay movie but one that can be appreciated and loved by heterosexual people as well as homosexual and bisexual people incapacity to handle his emotions divulges the way our society doesn't encourage us to act any differently and that is what engenders the discord between him and cedric this is definitely a must-see
what ever happened to michael keaton what a great actor and he proves it in this movie this movie is actually funny and the reason why this movie is funny is for two reasons an excellent script and michael keaton this movie is one of the funniest comedies in the history of hollywood this movie is the ultimate spoof of gangster movies in this movie hollywood actually pokes fun at itself by using the the gangster movie genre as the basis for a truly original comedy the rest of the cast is funny too especially the supporting cast if you like to laugh and want to watch a movie that contains nonstop humor then this movie is for you
example of how a world war documentary should be first hand accounts from actual troops and civilians whom participated in this awful archived footage gathered from around the time i caught this on a re-run on the history channel about a year and a half no knowledge really of the second world war at the it enveloped now i consider myself a world war and reading any and all that i can find about nothing comes close to this landmark worth buying the boxed set is quite simply documentary making of the very highest standard
i think hollow point is a funny film with some good moments i have never seen before in action movies tia carrere and thomas ian griffith aren't so good in acting but tia carrere is nice and good looking girl isn't it but donald sutherland is superb in his role so-so mad gangster
cat soup at first seems to be a very random animated film the best way i've been able to explain it is that quite acidic though not totally random the story is about nyatta a young cat boy and his sister nyaako nyaako is very ill and dies however nyatta sees her soul being taken away by death and is able to retrieve half of it the story is about their quest to bring nyaako fully back to a lot of the content in this movie seems completely random it is not most of it is symbolism for life death and rebirth you can also see references from other tales such as hansel and gretal this strangely cute short film has an interesting story packed with a deeper meaning than what you see on the surface of the screen
no one better spoil this piece of work awesome movie written expertly by the likes of ira levin and depicted with the best performance of christopher career and one of very best this is simply excellent i wish i could catch a staged version someday i will i hope this grossly underrated overlooked film has not become too difficult to locate because it a must for any hitchcockian agatha-phile or lover of great film one of very few movies i couldn't instantly solve or predict and worth a second or even third viewing deathtrap gets a and earns every iota of it we need and deserve more movies like this
this movie is excellent i found it very interesting i thought the wendigo legend was pretty cool the acting was also great as well as the costumes production photography directing and script very happy family on vacation gets stranded in the middle of nowhere after they hit a deer a huntsman then appears and is very angry and outraged over the fact that one of the is broken he then starts to stalk the family and weird things start to happen to them this movie worth it kudos to the cast crew and filmmakers two thumbs way up
this is the kind of picture john lassiter would be making today if it weren't for advances in cgi and just to say that he'd be forgotten too if technology hadn't made things sexy and kewl since has got the same wit imagination and sense of real excitement that you'd find in a pixar flick only executed under the restrictions of the medium c innovative animation techniques combine with a great script and excellent voicing to produce a movie that appeals on lots of levels it should be spoken of in the same breath with and
this is a very good under-rated slightly historical basic story concerns rob borrowing of pounds its theft and the problems it causes for his family and indirectly his tim roth is an amazing villain and character in this story brutally cold and if you watch his face he seems to be able to turn his eyes off and look completely roy neeson is excellent too but i think the writers used the word honour too many rest of the cast is strong and the whole movie is very well acted and action is exciting and the sword play very realistic but not too gory the story is good and you really want rob to in all just shy of a classic
okay i am a fan of the nightmare series and everyone says on here that this is the worst but not you seen revenge wtf that was the worst of all now this movie is pretty decent and it sticks to the freddy story and cool that he had a daughter etc then i found out it was in i was so excited i remember when i saw it on the dvd box set i instantly skipped to the sequences quite a lot was in though like lisa zanes hand dream demons claw than once lezlie dean holding a knife lisa zane with a baseball bat hand head truly loved this movie because it was in but i wish the whole movie was in not just the last the way minutes not ten
some people have stated that as of the season south park has started a trend of leaving behind their politically biting satire for shallow spoofs but this could not be further from the this episode does spoof the living dead series there is more it is a satire of how people treat the homeless characters say things like they're pretending to be just like us or they want to be human this episode attacks a culture of people who ignore the lower class who are often just down on their yes it is still a satire and also a wonderful spoof what more could you want
i found this movie to be exciting right from the a spielberg movie found the plot to be intriguing as i tried to figure out what the actual situation from the the opening the action starts bringing with it immediate two main characters are very likable have trouble liking any of the baldwins due to extra-curricular political activities but william was not too bad in this were several highly unexpected twists which contributed to the were unfortunately many places where there was an annoying high pitch sound in the like hz i suspect the microphone was picking up video monitors on the set
seriously can you imagine such a spread of talent in one film without a huge budget daniel day-lewis ray mcanally brenda fricker hugh o'conor and fiona shaw no doubting that fricker and day-lewis deserved their awards but it would have been entirely justifiable to have seen o'conor young christie and mcanally awarded the cliché is true here they don't perform the roles they inhabit them day-lewis performance is a tour de force such a transformation that it is awe-inducing but it was truly a mark of the intelligence that alongside this performance they also honoured brenda beautifully restrained still and heart-wrenching work as mother by the way if you haven't seen this magnificent actress in swann another film well worth checking out for her contribution the sublime miranda richardson
my observations postwar hilarity tom drake and grandpa from meet me in st louis two years later year i was born donna reed charming and pretty margaret hamilton good as always smaller part than in wizard of oz spring byington way prettier also with the prerequisite perky small nose lacked by hamilton tent scene at end with former boy next door was hilarious as a two year veteran of army tents he looked pretty youthful and inexperienced when i looked into his used to work in a department store and it was just as elegant as this one sadly it has disappeared and faded into obscurity we were famous for those great show windows that were used to lure passersby into the store to get them to buy all of that wonderful
dressed to kill is one of the best thrillers ever made its dealings with sex and violence make this a film for adults brian de palma once again proves why no other director can match his use of the camera to tell a story he directs many scenes without dialog and he tells much of his story strictly through the use of his visuals and pino brilliant score filmed in panavision the film must be seen in widescreen as de palma uses the entire width of the film to tell his story cropped on video dressed to kill is barely the same movie solid performances from its cast superb direction and perhaps the finest film score ever written make dressed to kill a must see
this is an excellent heartbreaking movie it is by far the best i've seen that depicts the current reality in latin corruption ruthless and greedy police officials and heartless mayhem towards innocent victims denzel washinton gives the most moving performance in his career in my opinion dakota fanning is an amazing young actress the relationship between washington and fanning is wonderfully written and portrayed i believed every minute the cast is brilliant christopher walken mickey rourke are great as always walken lights up the screen for me like no other actor i would have loved to see more of both of them the authentic locations are remarkable the camera work is interesting and different there are many famous latin actors in the cast making it all the more interesting for people familiar with latin american cinema i highly recommend this movie
lloyd bridges as mike nelson and his boat were all the stars of this series what made it so good to me when i watched it was the real feel of going underwater the show exhibits a youthful energy energy for exploration under water which is show was educational as well showing the viewer things about scuba diving from someone who appeared to be a consummate pro mike nelson there were excellent shows and the program always appeared to be well produced granted the drama in the scripts sometimes hit the same notes in more than episode but each show holds own with any other show produced during this era the infancy of american television
if the australian post office ever needed a promotional film for recruitment then this is is one of those movies heart is in the right place and you can watch again and again performance is touching as it shows an aspect of australia unimagined by many europeans in that it can be cold wet and bleak just like anywhere else and just like anywhere else what is important is the people that surrounds you the characters in the movie are warm and welcoming and make the prospect of a career move into a dead letter office a thought to be considered miranda has gone on to do bigger movies but i hope she always keeps a thought inside for this one
i've seen a lot of tv movies in my time as a student the majority the normal waste of time that us television throws out this one however was well crafted and plotted and had a very nice twist at the end having only seen richard dean anderson in macgyver and stargate i was surprised with his excellent performance rather than the rather gamut of expressions from a-b that he normally gives it was a pleasant surprise to see daphne zuniga after quite a long time dating back to the fly ii also nice to see robert guillaumme in a leading role again i can't say that i ever take jane leeves seriously after her benny hill days but she just about managed to cope well in her role all in all a highly recommended film
dark angel rocks the best show i have seen in ages damn those people who took it off me and my friends have gatherings to watch every da episode takes like days but it is worth it it finished before it finished what it wanted to say and that annoys the hell out of me
what can i say an excellent end to an excellent series it never quite got the exposure it deserved in asia but by far the best cop show with the best writing and the best cast on televison ever the end of a great era sorry to see you go
you think you've had it tough you should check out this film carl brashear is the epitome of courage and determination what this man had to go through to become a navy diver should be an inspiration to us all and significantly after seeing this film i learned that what is shown is not even the half of it cuba gooding jr does some of his best work to date as brashear de niro as usual is good as the southern redneck who trains him george tillman in only his second major feature soul food has made a quantum leap as a filmmaker if you want to be moved and inspired you definitely need to check out this one
the national gallery of art showed the long-thought lost original uncut version of this film on july it restores vital scenes cut by censors upon its release the character of the cobbler a moral goody-goody individual in the original censored release of is here presented as a follower of the philosopher nietsze and urges her to use men to claw her way to the top also the corny ending of the original which i assume is in current vhs versions is eliminated and the ending is restored to its original form a wonderful film of seduction and power hopefully there will a reissue of this film on dvd for all to appreciate its great qualities look for it
this is one of the funniest and most excellent movies ever made although i've only seen forty minuets of it and i must say this is a good movie the plot if funny and because sex around pretty much every corner of this movie really funny and i don't see how anyone could not like this film i really really really want to watch the rest of the movie it has one slightly sick scene in it me not very pleasant but apart from that this is a great movie i rate this movie an for comedy for sexual content and for the plot please if your a fan of american pie and you want to watch a movie where pretty much all sex in it the buy this movie it will please
my brother brought this movie home from the rental store and i remember expecting it to be such a bore i think the title especially put me off i can't ever remember starting a movie with such low expectations and being so completely won over i watched the movie twice before i let my brother take it back to the store it is very infrequent that a movie speaks to me the way this one did i was completely caught up in situation as she tries to make her way through her life the bad thing about this movie is that it seems to end so quickly i could have kept watching for hours another downside is that i have been unsatisfied with everything ashley judd has done since she is so perfect in this movie this film is easily in my top ten favorites of all time
this tale set in wellington new zealand suburbia of the renowned tawa college is first a contemporary new zealand flavour via satellite abounds with absolutely hilarious situations which develop in the family context at the same time it manages to invoke intense emotions of sadness and of the most moving and humourous movies of the year not to be missed
this film is hilarious original beautifully directed i have become a big bad swim groupie tracking it to film festivals whenever wherever i can i've seen it about half a dozen times now each time enthusiastic audience response has confirmed my feeling that this is one of the best films to come out in years at nearly every festival it has screened it has either sold out or won the audience favorite award clear that people love this film even clearer why they do the cinematography is superb the characterization acting brilliant the ending fantastic the direction filled with compassion wisdom the art of perfect timing hard to believe this is ishai first film i hope it will be released soon so everyone can see it
another outstanding foreign film which thoroughly trounces the never-ending crop of crud emanating from hollywood this is a story of life and living no definitely not the perfect little life so often depicted in the totally artificial hollywood movies but rather the real life complete with real characters each with strengths and weaknesses just like real people in our lives and dynamics of all of these lives intertwined within the walls of this bathhouse and particularly its aged owner are magnificent heart touching and highly thought back relax and be carried away into the simple and beautiful life there is real wisdom to be learned in this movie if you only open yourself up to will not be disappointed
this is a poem on film wonderfully presented and photographed with sensitive artistry it captures the atmosphere of the time and place perfectly lake district in the twenties a love story with a twist the characters are unique and believable the settings are deliciously exotic some of the scenes the funeral boat in the fog the high long shot of the chess table in the centre of an intricately patterned tile floor are beautiful images and rather than the mandatory happy ending this story has a bitter sweet one if film is an art this is close to a
shintarô katsu best known for the zatôichi films again stars in this third and final movie in the kenji misumi known for lone wolf and cub directed saga of hanzo the razor itami feature the big dicked one battling ninjas rapeing ghosts and uncovering shady goings on at the shogunate treasury the hanzo plot was kinda getting stale and repetitive what was once novel in the first film was not any longer fortunately this one was better then the second thanks to having more humor i'm just glad that they choose to stop at the one trilogy looking at you lucas grade b extras merely trailers for all hanzo the razor films candy aoi nakajima unleashes both tits mako midori just her left one
i really enjoyed the reunion a lot i would have rated it a if they had had hassie and little luke there wasn't even a mention of where they are today or why they didn't participate in the reunion they were very popular characters and i think it was a mistake not to give an explanation about their lack of i was glad that tnn ran the series again i had been looking for episodes for years and what a joy to be able to tape the whole series may have missed a few episodes jenny hanahan
as far as i can recall alterations to score are as the final section of the grossvatertanz traditional tune played at the end of a party is repeated several times to give the children a last dance before their scene is a violin solo written for but eliminated from score for the sleeping beauty is interpolated between the end of the party scene and the beginning of the transformation scene balanchine chose this music because of its melodic relationship to the music for the growing christmas tree that occurs shortly the solo for the sugar plum cavalier is seems to me the accusation that balanchine has somehow desecrated great score is misplaced
this movie is an extremely funny and heartwarming story about an orphanage that is in financial trouble when the director goes on vacation his dad agrees to step in temporarily to run is positively the best work that leslie nielson has ever done his idea in the film to rent out children is immediately innovative and his sales techniques will definitely make you little girl in this movie is so sweet and charming that i know i will never forget her just make sure that you don't miss the first five minutes of the movie great family entertainment is so rare these days if you go for slightly corny pictures with happy for this one i could watch this over and over and i often do my only complaint about this movie is that it is so difficult to find a copy
watching is a much better way of getting your bible lesson that going to sunday school despite a script that at times is unintentionally funny the film is highly entertaining the studio system had its faults but it spared no expense when a lavish production was called for peck portrays king david as a lusty but tormented poet who commits what is tantamount to murder to bed a sexy bathsheba susan hayward raymond massey as the prophet nathan delivers his usual saturnine and ferocious performance look for the silent screen star francis x bushman as king saul and a young gwen verdon as a dancer hooray for the old testament and hollywood
that film is absolutely fantastic if you watch it with your friends it can be a very nice day obviously you have to know that the film is stupid and very bad directed and acted what a couple and that is probably the worse film in the world but you can enjoy it very much we watched it in and it was a very nice evening the best scenes are the first one when the criminals kill the friend of alex and he tries to act like a desperate and the result is a comic scene of first category and then when he shows to leva what a name the palassio di giusstissia and then the accident of leva that once is going on her car out of the road and a second later the car is completely empty what a magic
at the time i am writing this i see out of over votes it has a rating something is wrong with that picture personally i give it a i can see a at the lowest or a possible if it was rated by people that see this movie for what it truly is it is a movie based on a comic book hero this movie won more than share of awards won oscars another wins nominations right there tells me better than a some great acting from some very good actors some great special effects and in my opinion will be if not already a classic for years to come if you're looking for pure entertainment be sure to check out dick tracy definitely a movie you can watch more than a few times al pacino is great as big boy caprice
this film is not about a cat and mouse fight as stated in the other comment its about a cat that has used up of its lives and now lives in fear of loosing its last one the cat is jumpy and scared to death all of the time hence the name fraidy cat fraidy previous lives haunt him as ghosts which are from different in time and are constantly trying to kill him off but he is most fearful of the ninth life which is represented as a cloud in the shape of a number and spits out lighting bolts very old now but would still be fun for the kids if you got hold of a copy watched this movie almost every day as a child o
war is hell but this documentary of wwii is only is this series a breath-taking almost-exhaustive look at the second world war a poetic masterpiece told clearly and superbly by laurence documentary series defines the genre sweepingly long no doubt but you will enjoy all of them and want to come back for more and more have the series on dvd and i probably watch the series three times a this is an impeccable bit of film-making other than olivier the best part of the series is listening to the veterans tell their stories whether it be about an actual battle or about finding a hog to butcher so they could have something delicious for going to go watch it right now my time
forget the campy religious movies that have monopolized the market this movie has a real feel to it while it may be deemed as a movie that has cheap emotional draws it also has that message of forgiveness and overall good morals however i did not like the lighting in this movie for a movie dealing with such subject matter it was too bright i felt it took away from the overall appeal of the movie which is almost an unforgivable sin but the recognizable cast and their performances counteract this worth seeing buy the dvd
years ago i did follow a soap on tv so i was curious about this movie and i was so rewarded for finding it a marvelous spoof of soaps with jealousies the usual actors insecurities and all sorts of lovely excesses but more than anything an amazing cast and an incredible script how did someone get all those top-notch actors to play in such a silly sort of movie and how did this little movie get writers to write the perfect lines i never hear anyone talk about this movie or even admit hearing of it but marvelous and i highly recommend seeing it sometimes i'll throw it on while doing housecleaning and end up sitting on the couch watching laughing and thoroughly enjoying the whole wonderful thing many congrats to all who made it
it isn't the worst film ever made the actors aren't apalling and the script and director are not completely inept isn't the best film ever made the actors aren't excellent and the script and director are not completely falls somewhere in the middle a fun somewhere an enjoyable well constructed need to say don't take it seriously or so bad its good or it wasn't scary none of these comments are relevant has atmosphere that atmosphere which is actually very unique and the one really original aspect of the movie which personally is what makes the film for me
this was one of those wonderful rare moments in that i wished i'd captured forever on vhs won't it ever air again was so creative and i remember it was aired once a week and the wait for the next episode was excruciating i want to see it all again i want to buy it i want what i can't have not even on ebay having ranted enough it was by far one of the best series the put out it should be considered a classic but is lost in space at least this website and wikipedia mention it was utterly appealing funny flirtatious and original maybe not like sherlock holmes original i actually think quintin is far more attractive and has a better chance with his leading lady than the stiff and chalky holmes ever could
this movie is great entertainment to watch with the wife or girlfriend there are laughs galore and some very interesting little nudist stories going on here the actresses are all very interesting and definitely worth watching in their natural beauty maslin beach life is full of diverse nudists and personality types the australian coast scenery is simply splendid to see what a place to visit to say the least and one day it may become my hideaway i really enjoy this movie and every time i watch it i enjoy it more i would love to see more of these characters and i always wonder what became of them although the plot is somewhat soft this movie is of course a great excuse to just sit back on the couch and enjoy the wonderful and famous maslin beach with these wonderful nudists and their own personal stories
in the rapid economic development of in china there is a resurgence of traditional chinese culture partially due to the rise of nationalism accompanied by the increase in wealth and more importantly due to the sense of spiritual belonging after the collapse of the old socialist ideology in the post cultural-revolutionary the resurgence of chinese traditional culture namely the confucianism was not without disasters because chinese are adopted the entire tradition without eliminating the bad part and the discrimination against girls demonstrated in this film is an excellent not only the part that should be discarded were inherited the good part that was supposed to be inherited such as the traditional opera and its technique such as changing face was ignored in the resurgence and facing director used this film to criticize the problem of re-embracing tradition by contemporary china and this is the deeper meaning behind the movie
very slight this movie being only on tv is absolutely excellent i really pay attention to the differences in looks or accents so i really comment on that the acting in this was so good i had to pinch myself and say remember only a movie this really happen as i sat and listened to harris and quinn talk i knew that it was exactly what john and paul would be talking about had they actually had this meeting the offhanded comments and burns from john were right on with his in the restaurant as was his depression while paul was very easy going and laid back both actors did and excellent job and i was thrilled to have seen this movie a wicked experience for any beatles fan and prepare for a few surprises
i've read most of the comments on this movie i have seen this the whole prophecy series many times with family members of all ages we all enjoyed and it just made us meditate on what we already knew from reading and studying the bible about the rapture and end times no one got scared or traumatized like i have read on some posts the movie is just based on biblical facts i have seen a lot of end time movies tribulation armagedon and so on and by far this one is one of the best in presenting bible truths it may not have a lot of great special effects like todays movies but i believe it is a good witnessing tool this movie and its prophecy series can be seen free at this website and judge for yourself blessings to all
this movie is just so good despite carmen electra this has to be one of the better films i have seen in awhile jamie kennedy is just amazing and loren dean plays an insane spoiled movie star very well the plot is great as well all very real which is scary it says here that a drama but this is one of the damn funniest dramas i have ever seen go check it out
what is very french about this film is the time taken to establish the two leading characters this might require a bit of patience especially since neither is attractive in the typical hollywood definition of such however once the heist kicks in the film rushes forward quickly perhaps at times too quickly but it is a real rollercoaster ride and if you don't look too closely it is all quite believable the kind of film that you know hollywood would have botched up
i just wanna say that amongst all the so-called classic hiphop films ive seen like wild style krushgroove breakin style wars etc imo beat street is the best amongst the others whenever i ask other people about which is their fave then it seems that beat street pops out the most but still its the lowest ranked of all is just a punch under the belt say points is the belt i love the music performances the breakdancing makes me wanna spin ramo makes me wanna throw a its a classic
this first part of the brd trilogy has more passion and plot density than lola but less of the magic of veronica voss the political musings have point to them we see the shortages after the war how the blackmarketers were able to control so much of the day-to-day life moment when fassbinder playing a grifter tries to sell a complete set of kleist to schygulla who remarks that burning books don't provide much warmth she really wants some clumsiness in the first hour the scene in room with the black soldier interrupted by appearance should go quicker the train scene when maria meets karl oswald falls flat when she insults the cringed it was so bad but as the story develops and the years go by i was drawn more and more into this glossy cold world
this is a very entertaining flick considering the budget and its length the storyline is hardly ever touched on in the movie world so it also brought a sense of novelty the acting was great to dom and the cinematography was also very well done i recommend this movie for anyone into thrillers it will not disappoint you
if you want to remember mj this is a good place to start this movie features sweet tunes mj as robot and a crazy messed-up plot i recall many a night passing out to this fine feature film in college and pondering the sheer awesomenes of whoever decided to green light this ridiculous piece of is lots of singing lots of dancing there is lots of singing while dancing mj slays it as you would expect when it comes to this stuff but there is much more to this movie there is claymation there are fat children there is an anthropomorphic rabbit that michael jackson has to battle in a dance off clay too there is joe pesci as well made of we love you michael it is a sad day for all of us
great entertainment from start to the end wonderful performances by belushi beach dalton railsback some twists and many action scenes the movie was made for me funny lines in the screenplay good music dalton as the tough sheriff and railsback as redneck-villain i must recommend this film to every action-adventure fan
timeless musical gem with gene kelly in top form stylish direction by vincente minnelli and wonderful musical numbers it is great entertainment from start to finish one of those films that people watch with a smile and say they don't make em like they used to but they never did quite make them like this the climactic minute musical sequence without any dialogue is among the most beautiful in film history movie magic clearly derived from the heart and soul of everyone involved a must see
i'm really suprised this movie didn't get a higher rating on imdb one of those movies that could easily get by someone but for romantic comedy moonstruck is really in a class by itself setting and ethnic charm are things people seem to take for granted the casting alone makes it a nearly perfect movie few movies in the were as good as funny too out of
cosimo guzmán is told in prison about a perfect behind bars and can't do it himself he has to leave it to his girl rosalind there are five guys organizing the five guys with very little brain anthony and joe russo are the directors of welcome to collinwood a crime comedy often very can't help but laughing when everything goes wrong with these are some great actors playing these plays washington is rockwell is jeter is davoli is union plays his love interest esposito plays love interest clooney producer plays jerzy the tattooed guy in a is a highly entertaining certainly recommend it
i swear when i first saw this cried my eyes out a star is born is the movie that lets you know what love is really like despite the obstacles john norman kristofferson and esther face you also experience what like to lose a love like that by the end of the movie streisand and kristofferson have such great chemistry together and the music is fantastic when streisand sings with one more look at closely now just pure magic this movie made the song evergreen one of my queen bee is such a fun song also i love the fashion of the afro besides a beauty a star is born is my number one favorite movie this movie is a pleasure to watch and is a heart-breaker at the end
i stumbled on this late last night n seen it since it came out originally but had never forgotten had completely forgotten how gorgeous and talented signe hasso was when she was still young ditto for shelly winters before she balooned coleman though was the quintessential state actor of his time i had read othello in high school english and hated it after seeing a double life i read it again and finally understood what the play was writing team was at its peak when this script was done movie well worth remembering and rewatching
this is a cartoon series where most of the action takes place in the human body where the actors are vitamins viruses blood cells etc i will not try to explain it in more details you will simply have to see it for yourself you will not be remember watching this as a kid in the swedish voices i have talked with a few people who were also children in the and they loved it also i must admit that the education-part of the episodes didn't get through to me at a conscious level but the whole idea of educating children while they have fun is wonderful i have recently seen a few episodes there is a humour and heart in it that is hard to find in other children programs
i saw this australian film about years ago and have never forgotten it the movie shows the horror of war in a way that hollywood usually glosses over the relationship between the soldiers of the two warring countries is highlighted by the differences in culture and the ultimate knowledge that in the end we are all really not different on the inside if you can find any type of copy of or rent it you won't be disappointed just awed

i don't know why the critics trashed this movie i hardly ever agree with them movie could have been a little scarier i don't usually go to horror movies i even had to psych myself up to see it in the daytime i needn't have bothered cinema was full of kids too heh liam was great as always i also liked catharine zeta jones and lili taylor house was very gothic and beautiful in a spooky way the special and sound effects were awesome i also loved the music score particularly the gentle tunes for eleanor and her journey to save the children how she grew out of her stagnant routine and life and finally gain her power peace and freedom
i thought that baseketball was one of the most funniest films i have ever seen witty humour made me giggle all the way through and the fact that trey and matt are so over the top boosts the comedy have just bought baseketball on dvd and its just one of those movies where you would never get tired of watching it i have a very short attention span and i think this film has so any funny bits that it keeps me entertained throughout the humorous quotes are memorable and can make me laugh for hours if i remember them overall i think that baseketball is brilliant movie which everyone should go see especially if you're younger like me as it will keep you laughing for a long time afterwards does anybody think its weird for me to like them both hehe
this movie is so cheap endearing with ron liebmann vaughn providing the most entertaining on-screen diatribes in film history i own copies of this movie on one ralph macchio is caught actually cracking up in the background at major vaugn while he is ranting at hash obviously they forgot to edit this mistake out of the film but it goes to show just how funny the movie is when the actors themselves can't keep a straight face
i didn't expect val kilmer to make a convincing john holmes but i found myself forgetting that it wasn't the porn legend himself in fact the entire cast turned in amazing performances in this vastly under-rated some have mentioned earlier seek out the two-disc set and watch the wadd documentary first it will give you a lot of background on the story which will be helpful in appreciating the movie people seem unhappy about the lapd crime scene video being included on the dvd there are a number of reasons that it might have been included one of which is that john holmes trial for the murders was the first ever in the united states where such footage was used by the prosecution if you don't want to see it easy to avoid clearly identified as lapd crime scene footage on the menu
this is a warm funny film in much the same vein as the works of almodovar sure it has a year old boy sucking milk from breasts but the style is so playful that i can't understand at all those readers who found it sick or perverted would i be willing to let my old son play the part not so sure cinema is often quite sexual but in a very open and healthy way that leaves the viewer without any sense of voyeurism or kink i think that we if we northern european types had the same attitude we'd be much better off as a liberal attitude is also seen in the hilarious fartman maurice character as his lover says to him most people are embarrassed about farting you turn it into an art form
this movie is not your typical horror movie it has some campy humor and death scenes which can be sort of comical i personally liked the movie because of its off-beat humor definetely not a super scary movie which is good if you don't want to be scared and paranoid afterwards i liked the performance of the hillbilly guy and of lester very believable i think i'm going to dye my hair red like that girl in very cool anyway overall worth renting for the campy humor and non typical horror experience
i first saw blood of the samurai at its premiere during the hawaii international film festival wow blood just blew us away with its sheer verve gore vitality gore excitement gore utter campiness and even more gore and all in such great fun especially for those of you who enjoy all those japanese chambara samurai and ninja films you definitely have to see blood
as an adult i really did enjoy this one i watched it with my granddaughters and the year old was fascinated and the month old giggled at the music is fun and the animation is wonderful this sequel does what return to neverland didn't accomplish a good follow-up to the cinderella story but what becomes of drusilla another sequel i hope so
everyone in the cast from sugiyama to aoki and toyoko is someone we know in everyday life they were so natural and transformation is incredibly believable the score is so moving it brought me to tears the choreography was beautiful without seeming athletic graceful dancing and charm gave me goosebumps tamako is such a wonderfully delightful character you can almost see the charmed schoolgirl in her face as she reminisces about seeing the king and i character is both hilarious and pitiful masako is so overwhelmingly natural as the bewildered wife you almost want to hug her to reassure her that everything will be all film is truly a keeper
been a spate of recent surfing movies that i seem to haphazardly run across without advance warning i caught this treasure on digital cable this week and what a pleasant surprise it was the focus is on the pioneers of big wave surfing from the greg noll to our current laird hamilton from waimea bay to mavericks to jaws hell i could watch a movie just about laird hamilton one of this great athletes so the rest is just gravy loads of good surfing mixed in with interviews of past and present surfing stars in pleasant relaxed and unpretentious fashion of all the surfing movies i've seen this tells the big-wave story the best and i think my favorite enjoy
only the chosen ones will appreciate the quality of the story and character design of this movie superior ancients that dwell in the lands of lore far beyond any average human understanding this movie pulls the adventure genre into a unique centrifugal magical force of fantasy unto thee mystical crystals of chalice stories come and go but the idea for a good story is to think positive not negative thoughts to create a good versus evil battle like never before embracing an impounding shimmering process that keeps imagination glowing in one dimension and out the other striking a quick flash of energy that transports a human to another world
this is one of the greatest sports movies ever made by hollywood what a wonderful story about one of the great sports figures of american history what makes the story of james j corbett especially interesting is that mr corbett introduced the style of boxing that continues to this day in that respect james j corbett was truly innovated but getting back to the movie all the performances were excellent alexis smith was beautiful indeed she looked like nicole kidman and although a period piece the story withstands the test of time it has not gone stale ward portrayal of john l sullivan has to be one of the great portrayals of an actual sports figure in the history of movies and the boxing scenes are realistic well-staged and highly effective that coupled with a great script makes this movie a must
from the start i knew i would be in for the best movie watching experience of my life the idea of two giant robots manned by brilliant humans fighting each other for control of the world was the most intense and well thought of plot i have ever experienced i can't even begin to describe the brilliant acting and well written script just just say it compares to both lord of rings pictures combined the academy had a grave oversight in not celebrating the joy that jox
i remember watching this in the then i have just recently borrowed a couple of episodes from our public a nearly year hiatus i have come to another conclusion most of the principals interviewed in this series some at the center of power like traudl junge doenitz of navy anthony eden are long gone but their first hand accounts will live generals and admirals to sergeants russian civilians concentration camp survivors all are on record here can remember the lord mountbatten interview in the is truly a gem and i believe the producer of this series was knighted by queen elizabeth for this work well these few episodes from the library makes me want to buy the is the only i have given any review but i have discovered like a fine bottle of wine it is more appreciated with a little time
well seeing as i am a major fan maybe i liked the movie more than normal people would however this movie is still excellent it had tons of surprises and it gave some more closure to the series while i was sad that bayliss turned into a murderer the overall feeling i felt was satisfied
i just thought it was excellent and i still do i'm grateful we're still able to see different stuff from what hollywood almost floods us with saving grace is smart and enjoyable those who feel offended by the marijuana thing better go see the bride sort of grace also shows that a funny movie doesn't have to be stupid i was laughing my ass off during most of it but also pondering questions about what was the female lead character supposed to do to pay her deceased a nutshell a witty storyline with typical english humour and good acting and directing you couldn't ask for
this is not the typical mel brooks film it was much less slapstick than most of his movies and actually had a plot that was followable leslie ann warren made the movie she is such a fantastic under-rated actress there were some moments that could have been fleshed out a bit more and some scenes that could probably have been cut to make the room to do so but all in all this is worth the price to rent and see it the acting was good overall brooks himself did a good job without his characteristic speaking to directly to the audience again warren was the best actor in the movie but fume and sailor both played their parts well
another demonstration of genius his first colour film is a darkly surreal look into the tragic lives of tokyo slum dwellers essentially a series of interweaving vignettes depicting several groups of people eking out a perilous existence in a harsh and uncaring post-war shanty town swinging from comedy to tragedy and back this film shows how people deal with the worst kind of life each in their own way mostly retreating into themselves and living in the fantasy worlds of their own heads withdrawing emotionally from those around them or drowning themselves in alcohol mixing kitchen-sink realism with kabuki-esque theatrics kurosawa toys expertly with the emotions of his audience drawing tears and laughter with equal deftness a wonderful draining experience
sure for super imagery and awesome sound a great home theater show off disk but this is also a touching drama as well as an informative documentary the parallel stories that are intertwined throughout this film will keep all viewers interested young old boys and girls alike will find that deep down we are all fans of the automobile especially the high performance indy machines that are the result of generations blood sweat tears ingenuity and perseverance the mark knopfler and ry cooder sound track is perfectly matched to the visuals and the content i don't want to give away the ending but the final driving sequence to quincy jones days like these just might bring a tear to your eye enjoy it
although well past the target audience i've always had a soft spot for ya fiction so i was naturally intrigued by the return of nancy drew to the is not a bad film the central mystery involving a long dead actress is presented in straightforward simplistic terms with dashes of jeopardy for the young sleuth nancy and her friends never take the threats seriously so young audience members will not be i really appreciated from the story was the final results were rather serious and meaningful and nancy seemed to understand and grow from the roberts is great as nancy drew and hopefully we'll see her again in another mystery
this movie starts out hilarious from about the second mark and continues it throughout the movie i cannot recall a scene where i didn't turn to look at people laughing with me he is the perfect actor for this roll because of the way he looks and the way he comedic parts were great to see from actors not very big or popular as you can see people do like this movie it is currently rated on imdb i think it should be in lets put it this way i haven't seen this funny of a movie since american pie or the original vacation see it if you want a laugh i give this movie of the highest thumbs up i have ever given since i found out about imdb great movie site
i started watching the show from the first season and at the beginning i was pretty skeptical about it original movie was kind of childish and i was just looking for some sci-fi show while waiting for the bsg new after few episodes i became a fan i've loved the characters the not-so-stupid-as-you-think-he-is jack o'neill the not-only-smart samantha carter the glorious teal'c women and kids favorite and brilliant dr daniel course stories sometimes not serious sometimes even ridiculous but mostly not about technology or space fighting about helping your friend even risking your life for him about we don't leave anybody behind struggling to the end when all hope is lost about the free will and all good qualities that makes a human now breaking a record going season and still doing good
movie was utter and complete garbage a disgusting hack of a director and should be ashamed by his own admission he read chapters of the book got bored and decided to make the whole thing up from would have never supported that trash if he'd been alive to see it it basically steals the name mocks politics of the book is a good portion of it and throws in some so the average idiot american moviegoer doesn't get anime isn't perfect but at least mostly accurate as best i can tell
as i watched this movie i began to feel very nostalgic as a child growing up in a rural area i felt as if i was a kid again the swimming pond called a tank in central texas the running through the countryside like a wild free spirit the story was very believable and i totally lost it and cried toward the end through the pain we go through in goes on and there can be forgiveness
there is a story but more essentially the world of this film begins in chaos and comes to order over the course of ten is a celebration of life and an optimistic assertion of objective truth and good representing along an axis unexplored in previous cinema this film should be taught in every high
i accidently felt on this movie on tv and i wasn't able to leave it really an excellent movie which makes people learning about history with the vietnam war the flower time the fight it illustrates the conflict of generation of political opinion of race which took place in the born in so i didn't know all that stuff france history is not a priority and that movie really learned me a lot of facts by the way i think all the actors are great especially jordana brewster josh hamilton and jerry o'connell now i can see this film more then time each day really great what a shame it only appeared on tv not in
the five deadly venoms is easily the most memorable flick from the shaw brothers stable maybe master killer it has the artists who came to be known as simply the venoms some of the best fight choreography ever and surprisingly for a kung fu movie a great plot one of my all-time favorites
amazing performance from simon pegg who just gets better and better with every role as usual he plays the part of a very cringy character who makes you want to hide behind your cushion in embarrassment for him sometimes but thats what pegg is all laughs were regular and eye watering and everyone of them aimed at penn the movie was very cleverly put together where every character plays a very sophisticated and serious part with penn being the only humour involved which is a huge credit to the director robert i cant let this one go without a quick round of applause to gilliam anderson who shone throughout highly recommended to all
this show is so full of action and everything needed to make an awsome show but best of all it actually has a plot some of those new reality shows it is about a transgenic girl who escapes from her military holding base i totally suggest bying the dvds i've already preordered them i suggest you do to
critically people say that antz is better antz is a good film but i enjoyed life a bit more i can't remember a pixar animation other than the two toy story films that i was laughing so hard the animation is clean the story is original and doesn't preach the voice overs are what make this movie dave foley is an earnest ant that gets himself into trouble a lot hopper is a superb characterisation by the always wonderful kevin spacey as is haydn panettiere as dot there is also sterling support from dennis leary david hyde pierce and madeline kahn and i could go on and on the script is fantastic so funny and sometimes even touching it lacks the social messages of antz but what we have is rock-solid entertainment bethany cox
dressed to kill is surely one of the best movies ever and extremely suspenseful mixture of sex and acting is pretty orchestral score by pino donaggio is unforgettable and plenty of surprises to keep thriller fans to kill is a murder mystery that involves a sexually frustrated teenage a high price call murderer in the film is a transsexual named bobbi who is also one of film is full of breathtaking infamous elevator murder scene is extremely stylish and pretty gory as recommended
i voted for this movie because of some minor childish flaws other than that this movie is one of my favorites entertaining to say the least the shooting scenes are ridiculous though and i think gackt wrote the book takes a little bit too much of his matrix obsession into it it seems like their enemies just stands to get shot at however this movie is touching and it always makes me cry it has a lot of great humor in it so it makes me laugh as well gackt is a superb actor i must shows so much emotion this was first time acting and he did okay the role fits him wang lee hom is absolutely great the whole cast is what i would say perfect for this movie don't miss it you'll regret it
i'm amazed we see even one nay-sayer criticizing this old film we don't ordinarily get good opera films and here is a true grand opera rendition understandably the visuals are not great dated but as opera it can't be faulted and i'm an opera buff i can't even detect one lip-sync if we didn't know that was tebaldi in the audio nothing would convince me it isn't sophia loren she does everything with flair her dark makeup is fine and she brought the role to gorgeous life the rest of the cast is wonderful as is that stunning ballet troupe most of the actors are excellent loren truly marvelous her rival amneris is also terrific whoever didn't care for this job is shamefully remiss verdi would have enjoyed it naturally renata tebaldi as aida is the engine behind the scenes i love this old movie
this is a great show and will make you cry this group people really loved each other in real life and it shows time and time again email me and chat i have been to australia and they real do talk like want you to enjoy five mile creek and pass on these great stories of right and wrong and friendship to your kids i have all episodes on dvd-r that i have collected over the last years see my five mile creek tribute at and hear the extended theme music talk about people are so cool
peter bogdonavich has made a handful of truly great films and they all laughed is one of his best the cast couldn't be better equipped to play this light but slightly bittersweet screwball comedy interestingly enough the witty light touch bogdonavich so effortlessly employs gives the film a rather disarming emotional core fresh and immediate the film starts with absolutely no explanation no soundtrack music to cue us we meet the characters in action and as bogdonavich glides down the streets of new york the film unfolds effortlessly robby camera captures it all with an understated simplicity that seems accidental but surely isn't the cast is terrific in every way a classic
wonderfully put wish there was a follow up to this documentary to follow up with the lives of some and celebrate the lives of others should be a part real one it was film wasn't long would like to know why the creator of the film did not follow up this is so important to the community if your are reading this please consider doing another documentary of this am really tired of hearing from naive writers how aids and men go together when they don't actually its the that we need to look film didn't even bother to mention hiv or aids and i was so glad for really appreciated the break downs and definitions too thank you s much for allowing this film to exist
i think that this movie is very neat you eithier like michael jackson or you don't but if you like him then you have to see this movie i think that it is a very neat film with great song play and good imagination not to mention the film center piece smooth criminal which has some of the best dancing you will every see
freddy krueger the dream stalker from elm street great character actor robert englund is back in this sequel of nightmare dream hope i got the number been so this one is one of the for the cameos barr did the very first nightmare in will see freddy as a tormented teenager who loves as a family effects are very funny and cast also includes lisa sister breckin and let amanda knows was one of the people saw this in the love missed the first wave in wasn't even born second wave was in like all the freddy one stands out as one of the better ones not counting the first which was absolutely became the new monster of the and with jason leather you imagine a film with all of recommend this to all freddy fans and horror fans freddy is such a cut out of
i liked this movie when the guy who was in on a bank heist of million in gold dies his cell mate is used as bait to lead them to the high-tech crazy killer partner having a monitoring device implanted in his jaw without his knowledge an action spy type film with enough comical scenes to keep it light it reminded me of enemy of the state well acted and good enough plot
something wonderful about the fact that a movie made in can be head and shoulders above every tarzan movie that followed it including the bloated and boring piece greystoke once the viewer gets past the first three scenes which are admittedly dull tarzan and his mate takes off like a shot offering non-stop action humor and romance maureen is charming and beautiful as jane and walks off with the movie weismuller is solid as well highly recommended
i saw this film for the very first time several years ago and was hooked up in an instant it is great and much better than j f k cause you always have to think can it happen to me can i become a murderer you cannot turn of the tv or your vcr without thinking about the plot and the end which you should'nt miss under any circumstances
i enjoyed this film perhaps because i had not seen any reviews etc it was delightful and a little bit of a romp i don't know why it didn't make more of a splash than it did as far as the story goes i could relate to some aspects of the paul reiser character and i could see my dad in character made me remember a lot of past times when i was a kid and listening to my grandparents too if you enjoyed movies like grumpy old men or on golden pond this is your movie a sleeper in my opinion and one of those feel-good stories peter falk and paul reiser had many wonderful verbal tussles yet nothing was overdone i would say it rates at least an perhaps higher
i see a lot of folks on this site wishing ag would come out on dvd well i bought it on dvd borders no less while it is great to have this terrific show in a boxed dvd form i am upset by the fact that they added very few in the way of director commentary from shaun cassidy on the pilot episode and the episodes are shown in the same order they were put out on tv the missing episodes that were never shown prior to being run on sci fi channel are in the box set but are tacked on the final dvd if you buy the dvd set get the actual order they are to be viewed and you will be happier will need to swap in and out of your player to see them in order but you will be glad you
may seem like an overstatement but it is is so hard to comprehend is why didn't they make more musical shorts like this wasn't the beauty of it totally apparent to everybody involved i guess not so many shorts were made for commercial reasons only and with some luck there may be some artistic value in there this is one exception the only one where it seems they were the director had a vision and clearly could appreciate the music as art why didn't anybody ever think to shoot lester or charlie parker on a live date crazy pity there were no sequels if you've seen anything of similar quality please share it
clara lago is wonderful as the title character of the film essentially a film about a girl who moves to spain with her mom at the time of the spanish civil war it turns out the mother goes home to die and she is left with her grandfather she also makes friends and experiences much in a short time tomiche jose ballestra is at first a nuisance to her then they become close the film is shot beautifully bathed in soft colors mostly carol yearns for her dad who is a pilot in the war and you can feel the love sher has for him while the war itself is kind of taken a back seat in this film it envelops the lives i think you'll like it see it especially for clara lago who does a great job as carol she is definitely one to watch
well this was one of those films i caught on the off-chance and it was good enough for me to record when it showed up next time if like myself you enjoy many horror flicks that branched out a little from the norm not just another glut of generic sequels then i think you may enjoy this when the bad guy eventually turns up in person he was definitely not what i expected to see all in all i wouldn't go out of your way for this one but if you like the genre then watch it if it comes up and you have an hour and a half to kill i guess i'd give it out of
this is a wonderful film the non-stop patter takes several watchings to fully appreciate the musical productions of busby berkeley will never be duplicated i think this movie easily outdoes all of his other efforts joan blondell and james cagney are incredible together some of the humor would almost push the boundaries of movies put rational explanation of how they did it aside and enjoy it for the spectacle that it is
this move was friggin hilarious funniest i've seen in a while akshay and john kick ass as always and the chicks are hot too the story is awesome lots of great jokes and whoever reviewed this before me is an idiot to him i say that u are not of indian background so u wouldn't understand the humor u moron don't rate movies u don't understand what did u watch the subtitle version where majority of jokes are lost in translation thats what i thought jackass kumar is the best actor ever and proves once again his versatility he can do not only action but comedy as well and is excellent at it john has proved himself as well this is his first comedy role and he was also excellent at it
this is such a great movie call me anna because it shows how a person has suffered for so long without knowing what was wrong with her for patty duke to come out in the publics eye and tell her story is an inspiration to those who suffer from this disease i have a lot of respect for her as a person the only thing i don't like is i can't get it on tape i've tried looking for it but with no success any one know how to get it
this was a really cool movie it just goes to prove that you don't need silly litle things like continuity and scripts to make a movie it traverses continents in seconds people get shot and nothing happens to them swords set on fire samuari fight on sinking galleons david essex is the epitome of slimey villainy and john rhys davies is just the dude i enjoyed this movie but i like movies this is the perfect example of a very movie that just kicks ass if you like battlefield earth you'll love this film its swashbuckling its fast its silly its also looks as if it was made in
father and son communicate very little in fact they speak different languages but when the son drives his father miles for his to mecca the conversations finally take place they are difficult and growth is necessary on both movie takes us into the hearts of these two travelers and it is indeed a grand voyage for the audience as well as the two principals the imagery throughout is impressive especially the final scenes in mecca it underlines for me once again how much different the world can be but also at the same time how similar the same was true for the father and son in this this movie tell your friends to see it you'll be glad you did
i really enjoyed the first episode and am looking forward to more a little soft on the crime front almost an afterthought and not terribly suspenseful or fleshed out but thought the romance angle was wonderfully charming will be watching again for sure hoping that they'll have a bigger role for the aunts who are wonderful actresses and were somewhat underused this time around the actress who plays the from bewitched i think is very sweet and bubbly and comes off as nicely dorky and sweet instead of dumb and annoying which is very it out
i was brought up on doc was petrified by the green death as a child but even then as now i found it thoroughly have made countless friends and colleagues watch this film and have been most amused by the diversity of they mostly think i'm odd but there you are i don't know what it is about the doc but he always gets the girls has to be the ultimate line when you look at his sad band of men this film is a classic spoof on all the super hero was way before is not to be taken seriously move over austin powers ron ely is a is unfortunate that this film hasn't been released on dvd in the uk i don't think it should be remade and bastardised like i said a cannot be done without the italian job without and michael caine i give it
there wasn't a day in where i wasn't chased by a scarecrow i felt that this film handled a serious issue brought back a lot of memories as it was so today i have nightmares about corn on the cob and can't even go near the tinned stuff in fear of my have to admit though at one point in the film i did have to turn it off as it hit too close to those of you who have never been attacked by a scarecrow by watching this film you could be educated about how it felt for us victims film teaches us not to take life for granted or to mess with corn believe me i've been there and i have the scars the film its amazing and educational
what a great film it is the notion of nations sending people fighting each other with giant robots is tacky the ending is not just a fitting one more i am intrigued by the characters it is a pity we never see the relationship of achilles and athena more developed beyond just a couple of kisses and fear for safety their romance is very
here italy write from venice why cancelated the abc should have given it a chance to build an audience the cast davis campbell scott erika christensen zoe saldana jay hernandez and bridget moynahan is one of the best i've seen in recent we need more shows like this that makes viewers feel like they are intelligent individuals not mindless drones i hope that abc will reconsider its decision or another station will pick it up please sign online petition to abc please sign online petition to abc
vampires sexy guys guns and some blood who could ask for more moon child delivers it all in one nicely packaged flick gackt is the innocent sho who befriends a vampire kei their relationship grows with time but as sho ages immortality breaks his heart it doesn't help that they both fall in love with the same woman the special effects are pretty good considering the small budget a touching story ripe with human emotions you will laugh cry laugh then cry some more even if you are not a fan of their music see this film it works great as a stand alone vampire out of
i have been a fan of this movie for years and years because of teri hatchers move into the forefront i had to take the movie off the shelf and watch it why people back in did not see how wonderful this movie was in beyond me sally field and kevin kline are beyond fabulous although i never have watching daytime soap operas this movie kills me every time i watch it the acting is second to none for a comedy and the writing is so smart i highly recommend that you watch this if you haven't already you will get to see elizabeth shue whoopi goldberg teri hatcher and carrie name a give splendid performances
i am embarrassed to say that i missed the mother when it was in theaters i saw it this evening on dvd i gave it a vote one of the very few i have given here this english independent is filmed with such great care and quality it drew me in relentlessly the story low-keyed and purely human is brutally honest and utterly absorbing thanks to the acting of anne reid daniel craig and cathryn bradshaw the cinematography is stunning the score is hard-wired to the plot the storyline is epic brilliantly clothed by writer hanif kureishi in mundane lives this story addresses big issues with the subtlety of an impressionist painting and some of those big issues are highly controversial which probably explains the lack of awards won despite many nominations it is simply one of my all-time favorite films
i loved the episode but seems to me there should have been some quick reference to the secretary getting punished for effectively being an accomplice after the fact while i like when a episode of columbo has an unpredictable twist like this one its resolution should be part of the conclusion of the episode along with the uncovering of the interplay between peter falk and ruth gordon is priceless at one point gordon playing a famous writer makes some comment about being flattered by the famous lt columbo making a tongue-in-cheek allusion to the real life fame as a crime-solver this is one of the best of many great columbo installments
this movie contains one of richard greatest performances as an actor who plays a dictator and does it so convincingly that his own mother does not detect the impostor also this movie is funny yet has a serious side as well what is especially intriguing about this movie is the character madonna who is the mistress but eventually becomes the leader of the country evolution from mistress to political leader added greatly to the quality of the story and to the entertainment value and the main character who at the start of the movie is a struggling actor and somewhat of a buffoon evolves too and by the end of the movie commands respect i liked this movie
outstanding film of with paul lukas giving an oscar calibrated performance as the head of his family bringing them back to america from europe as the nazi menace usual terrific bette davis maintains her reputation here and for a change was not nominated for best actress for this or any film of treachery around them lukas successfully deals with the situation he knows he must return to europe on a clandestine mission and return he again pulls out all the stops with a katharine hepburn-like shedding of tears when they must part resolute she knows that her older son must follow him on his path to wonderful film highlighting american positive propaganda against a wicked foe
i never heard of the book nor care to read it but the movie i will probably see many film is unforgettable with perhaps the richest imagery i have ever seen in a movie it was as if i was looking at paintings many times which i think was the movie story actors and cinematography full of profound emotions from every angle although i am not particularly fond of romance movies i loved this and was deeply moved by winona plea to her father toward the irons deserved an award for his performance and close was never
nay sayers of this film are likely bitter from some seriously unrequited love this is a great film for anyone capable of understanding johnny song or any song from that era bobby beyond the sea or stan the girl from ipanema et measure films by how many times i have to watch them before i'm satisfied chances are had me back a few good also watch the synergy between the cast i thought they worked well your heart and let the comedic magic of film transport
there are very few movies that are so funny as this one i was lucky enough to watch this movie at a theater reserved for movie buffs like me so it was not so embarrassing sitting there laughing till my jaw was completely sore and my shirt sleeves were all wet from drying my times the story was a bit slow but that is perhaps for the best a bit of rest in-between the rolling amongst the aisles nearly fell out of the seat was most welcome
what an absolutely stunning movie if you have hrs to kill watch it you won't regret it too much fun rajnikanth carries the movie on his shoulders and although there isn't anything more other than him i still liked it the music by takes time to grow on you but after you heard it a few times you really start liking it
as it is also known is one of the most visually stunning films i have ever seen the blend of grayscale and colour photography is near seamless a true feast for the eyes the picture was a contender for a golden palm in canners the award went to barton fink coen brothers a film stylistically very similar to zentropa an exercise in class rent both films and be a judge for yourself
it is a superb swedish film it was the first swedish film i've seen it is simple deep what a great nyqvist did a great performance as a famous conductor who seeks peace in his hallgren was great as his inspirational girlfriend to help him to carry on never give fight between the conductor and the hypocrite priest who loses his battle with michael when his wife confronts him and defends noble cause to help his hometown people finding their own peace in only thing that i didn't like was the ending it wasn't that good but it has some deep meaning
i am a massive fan of jet li he is the best hk action film star alive and consequently this film rocked i saw it in the video store and as it was in the mainstream section of this mainstream video store i didnt register its presence at first and had to look twice i immediately knew what i would be renting out my only qualm suppose i expected it is that it was dubbed and not subtitled elsewise the plot and full on action made it one of jet better movies even though they all fall under that category
a little nonsense now and then is cherished by the wisest you are too smart to watch this movie then you are too smart to be alive romp wonderful premise period piece done with acute eye for matthau meg ryan tim robbins et al just it sit down relax take it in smile a little enjoy yourself thank me
as a producer of indie movies and a harsh critic of such i have to say i loved this movie it is funny and intelligent well directed and entertaining hats off to the producers and directors for making a good one i'll be watching for the next one i gave it a
i totally thought that this was a great movie for wells from gilligans promise shown of a barely then known dana was disneylike and for that it can hardly be disregarded as meaningless it wasn't scary and wasn't meant to wont ruin the it was unusual the way that it was mean the kids characters were great and i didn't know what to expect in the basic plot also had a lot more to do with these kids than you say the fact that these kids were expert fishermen is very central to the plot especially also helps them out of a jam towards the also has the plus of not being overly think it clocks in at under minutes
white fire has so much going for it with larry bird look-alike robert ginty leading the charge blazing away with his fabulous hair and super macho mustache the movie soars above other low-budget actioners the charisma he has in this makes tom selleck look like a putz with ginty beating up everyone the movie only rises in awesomeness when a story of diamond intrigue enters into play then add in fred williamson some frontal bush chainsaw attacks and some awesome incest flick ends up delivering on all cylinders if you're looking for some awesome b-action this is where at now if i can just get my hands on that soundtrack
this movie surprised me some things were clicheish and some technological elements reminded me of the movie enemy of the state starring will smith but for the most part very good mix with jamie foxx and comedian mike epps and the wannabe thugs julio and ramundo some comic relief this is a movie you can watch over again-say some wednesday night when nothing else is on i gave it a for entertainment value
when i first found out that brian krause was going to be in this movie i wanted to watch it took me weeks to realize that i've seen the original of this and loved it so i had even more reason to watch well i watched it was actually better than most sequels for tv movies i hate what happens to character can find out for yourself and i didn't like most of the characters one included but the movie needed the cheesy and annoying and jerk-like characters to make stanley caldwell nelson shine once more at the end i was cheering for stanley and his own happy ending if you liked the original cabin by the lake or if you like horror movies without the blood i'd suggest you watch this
i found this film to be a fascinating study of a family in crisis when leo the oldest announces that he is the reactions of the family members alone and with each other was touching and yet have never seen a family that was as physically demonstrative as this one nor one as likely to shout at each other i didn't understand why the family felt that youngest couldn't deal with the news but once past that difficult i found this a thoroughly moving
to many people beat street has inspired their lifestyle to something creative concerning the hip hop young lee is living in ny in the when hip hop was at its beginning his a crew member of beat street b-boy crew the movie follows lee in his average day dancing graffitiing director has succeeded in making a movie with a plot and at the same time presenting hip hop to the rest of the world the movie has old school features such bambaataa the soul sonic force grandmaster melle mel the furious five the rock steady crew the new york city breakers and many the movie beat street nor the beat street spirit will ever die
ko to tamo peva is the best comedy of all times believe me i saw a lot of movies and comedies but tell me which one make you smile every time you watching it but truth is that the humour in this comedy is is caratherisic for serbia and all former republic of yugoslavia know it very well so i think the rest of audience example in enjoy it so much because the subtitles ruin the hole thing but they should at least try yes it is ironic this is the best flick in serbian history and the world doesn't understand it if you have got a chance to see this one don't blew up ok
i like the movie twisted desire had jeremy of my favorite and one of the cutest actors ever melissa joan hart is a good actress i've seen most of her movies but all of jeremy the thing i dislike about twisted desire is when nick gets arrested and jennifer rats him out twisted desire is my second favorite movie my first is the goonies but i still love jeremy jordan
julie waters is always marvelous but adrian pasdar is a positive revelation in this wry gender-bent comedy about a transvestite who cannot suppress his obsession and the changes he goes through when discovered unerringly eschews the vulgar raucous easy jokes for genuine wit and true insight and has an absolute ball while doing it a very nice low-key feel-good comedy
this movie is one of my very favorites hard to explain why maybe the innocence of corin nemec and his awkwardness paired with the boldness of cheryl pollak but it definitely has something to do with the soundtrack also some of the characters have little lines or movements or moments that are amusing in and of themselves finally the story is one that always tugs at my heartstrings and the last scene is so bittersweet all in all i love this movie perfect for a gooey sentimental girls night
eddie murphy delirious is by far the funniest thing you will ever see in your life you can compare it to any movie and i garuntee you will decide that delirious is the funniest movie ever this movie is about mins and throughout that time there was barely a moment where i wasn't laughing you will laugh for hours after it is over replaying the punch lines over and over and over in your head eddie murphy has given so many funny performances over his career hills to america the nutty this is by far his most hilarious moment i have seen this movie so many times and it is funnier every time it never loses its edge from this day forward every great stand up performance will be emulated from delirious and two thumbs up
this movie was one of the best disney movies i've ever seen great for the entire family to watch the ideas may be a little far-fetched but a feel-good comedy and the acting is great love the little boy and academy award winner adrien part may have been very short but very memorable highly recommended
i must say as a girl with a cowboy of my love this left me lovin them boots and wranglers even told my friend about it and she loved it just as were bout at the think the greatest love story ever own it and never get tired of bud sissy
i may be getting ahead of myself here but although the film itself was a technical masterpiece for its time i watched it piece-by-piece on tcm last night the question arises to me why did they do that putting their lives in jeopardy many of them died on the trek why would they undertake such a life-endangering journey just to find food for their animals once they reached the land of milk and honey why didn't they just stay there would you endanger your life and that of your entire community just to find food for a herd of cattle as dangerous as it was to do it for that purpose alone shows the inbred simplicity of these types of people risk death for a cow better them than i
even though this movie is quite old no matter how many times i watch it it still makes me laugh particular quote in the movie stands out joe piscopo pulls up to the office parks in a disabled spot partner says can't park here for the handicapped replies i am is one of the many lines in the movie that no matter how many times you watch it'll make you dangerously stands in my top movies of all an added bonus it also includes the legendary actor peter boyle in the cast so watch this movie like myself many others who have watched it you'll be hooked
i have been a star trek fan for as long as i can remember when they announced the planning and premiere of the fifth series i was very premiere of enterprise was well worth the wait it was well done with the perfect setting and a great acting job done by all the characters the enterprise is the perfect vessel to show the beginnings of what many people have come to bakula was just superior as captain jonathan archer jolene blalock gave a commanding performance as subcommander t'pol that it just two people of this wonderful new crew that is boldly going to take us into the great history of looks like going to be a good series well worth watching and i recommend that watch it
at your video store you might find this human condition in modern times la no exaggerated drama just a collapsing of events that might happen to any group of individuals over you understand the joys and desperation of urban direction and cutting are top class cinematography and music very much follows the mood and situation and the cast casting and excellent acting no one out of place or out of not really as much a downer as you would expect i gave it of you havent seen it do
the house of the spirits is a gripping tale of family intrigue south american politics and super-natural powers meryl streep glenn close and jeremy irons bring isabel novel to life with all its passion and suspense this in my view is one of the best films of the jeremy irons as esteban trueba ages and mellows very believably while meryl streep in the role of clara maintains her gentle loving warmth throughout her relatively short life winona ryder and antonio banderas make a handsome couple struggling for family acceptance in a racist culture glenn close as sister gives a very moving performance the countryside of portugal is a reasonable substitute for a non-tropical latin american country settings of home and ranch are effective and the period us cars add nicely to the post-war atmosphere
once a year comes a movie like that and makes things easy for you you don't have make an effort to think it is good just is you enjoy it while you watch it and you take it home with you i can't say it is totally flawless but near acting great story and with elements of suspense a small family story pretty much predictable but not the secret itself that matters it is the way the it takes the blind girl to reach it i was impressed by the way the director portrayed their deep relationship blind girl and her cousin the only thing i didn't like that much is the actress that played the mother she was too tough and without necessity keren
based on robert louis st ives the film tells the story of a dashing young french hussar captain marc barr during the napoleonic wars captured in battle he is sent to a prisoner of war camp in the scottish highlands run by major farquhar e grant in short order he falls in love with a local girl friel strikes up a friendship with the major and discovers that his long lost grandfather who fled from france during the revolution lives just up the road spirited performances from all the cast and some memorable lines make this an above average offering
the thing that makes this movie so scary is the way that it portrays andre and calvin as normal guys these are definitely not people who want to become professional filmmakers since they goof around in front of the camera forget scripted lines etc they are only making the video as a diary to show the survivors how normal their lives were their parents just think the guys are filming for a family home video by researching other kids attacks on their schools andre and calvin learn what not to do and they inform in a silly this old house kind of way any potential andres and calvins who might be watching this video how to make bombs get weapons and not get caught before zero day day of the attack
i own this movie and have watched it several times throughout the years since it was released prince doesn't stun us with his phenomenal acting style or anything a musician and i feel like that is what he displayed here just the best one to tell this story through influence most of this movie is straightforward and teenish but that is the fault still it is a great movie with even better music the principals and moral convictions in purple rain are quite strong and if more movies would rely on the basics we are taught as young children we would have a better all around environment seeing that art reflects life which reflects art
i love the movies and own the comics the comics are different then the movie but still i'd give it out of it was awesome if the movies got anymore awesome i would have her babies and i am female read the comics you won't regret it yes in this movie since brian p the artist for her died we don't get nearly as good artistic work i mean seriously don't get me wrong these people did great but different versions for different people different strokes for different folks as the saying goes any guy who doesn't go bonkers over her is insane or does not like women or you know just plan insane if i could count on my fingers how in love and how many times i have read the comics i would run out of fingers for sure but hey there is always toes
once you can get past the title pecker is a great film perhaps one of john waters best a wonderful cast headed by strong performances by edward furlong and christina ricci make the story very funny and very real there are some shocking scenes that are definitely not suitable for young children but they are there for a purpose unfortunately this movie was not mass produced and most of the public will be denied the opportunity to view it if the opportunity knocks then go see this film
bette midler is again divine raunchily humorous in love with burlesque capable of bringing you down to tears either with old jokes with new dresses or merely with old songs with more power punch than ever all in all singing new ballads power-singing the good ones such as the rose stay with me and yes even wind beneath my wings the best way to appreciate the divine miss m has always been libe since this is the next best thing to it i strongly recommended to all with a mixture of adult wide-eyed enchantment and appreciation and a mischievous wish for pushing all boundaries
a real classic ten out of ten every actor is perfect the screenplay is a haunting succession of suspenseful scenes scenes in car and scenes in the mountains are breathtaking wonder if this film is already out in dvd because it must be seen in widescreen version saw this film in the late fifties maybe three or four times and never since then forgot remember it was one of the first warner like cinemas cope features process called warnerscope which gave a very neat cinematography shelley winters and jack palance deserved an oscar for their only thing i could criticize is not having been directed by someone like say nicholas ray to increase its rhythm and tension
we as a family were so delighted with the last of the blonde bombshells we purchased a copy for our home video acting is and the cast contains many favorite actors and singers the theme is unusual and the script well written the are timeless and takes us back to our young days when we sang the songs at the top of our voices to outline the story here would spoil the plot as it is really nice to sit back and enjoy the story as it marks to this most enjoyable and uplifting production and we heartily recommend it to anyone who is looking for a belly-laugh and lots of music
a wonderful film version of the best-selling book and smash broadway play about the lives of sadie and bessie delany two african-american sisters who both lived over the age of and told their story of witnessing a century of american history ruby dee and diahann carroll give very good performances as bessie and sadie respectively amy madigan also is good as amy hill hearth the white new york times reporter whose article about the sisters launched the book etc many of the flashback scenes and even many of the present-day ones are very powerful if not quite as inspirational as in the book that is the only real drawback combined with the fact that certain aspects of the story are not presented clearly such as the inter-racial background of the sisters mother and why their father was so stern but other than that a very well-done excellently performed powerful movie
well of course not women are overly sensitive and needy on average which is interestingly portrayed from mother to whore though not pseudo-artistically extravagantly or blatantly dwelt on unlike many of you i have only seen la maman et la putain twice as many good films i noticed my opinion of it improved after a second viewing all that i know is what i have seen and have yet to delve into further exploits until i myself have acquired the dvd i have yet to figure out precisely why i enjoy this movie so much but really what do i care why though i'm sure i could and will form some wonderful explanation all right so you may disagree perhaps it is a bit boring at times i'm not an expert the blonde reminds me of a lovely grushenka
a great movie lansbury and tomlinson are perfect the songs are wonderful the dances with a particular mention for the portobello ballet are gorgeous as for the animated section the match between animals has become an instant classic the climax with the attack of the armatures is chilling and fascinating i recommend to see the restored minutes version or at least the minutes video here in italy we have only the minutes version although the film was presented in its original release at the running of minutes if possible watch also the german videocassette it was generated from the minutes running but missing of every refer to world war ii and of all the scenes between english people and their nazi invaders
me and my sister use to rent this every time we got movies and our parents would get so mad at so they let us anyways and i love can't find anyone that lives near me that knows what i am talking glad to see that i'm not the only one that loved this wish i could find this on dvd somewhere i would love to watch this now just bc i loved it so much as a little i'm now i remember so much about where i got the little bunny fufu song from and all my friends know the song but not the movie i think the little girl got there by sliding down the slide on her little playground thing
i have to say that this is one of the best movies i have ever seen i was bored and looked through the and found home room and it was already in about min but i got hooked it was so interesting and moving it shows what can happen in life i give it a more if possible the writer and actors did an amazing job i think teens should watch this movie and will learn from it it was great drama mystery and more i cried for hours i think that the writer should write more movies like this one i loved it i didn't even know about this movie which is sad because it was so good i wish it could go in the movies for more people to see
i love this movie my friend marcus and i were browsing the local hastings because we had an urge to rent something we had never seen before and stumbled across this fine film we had no idea what it was going to be about but it turned out spectacular thumbs up i liked how the film was shot and the actors were very funny if you are are looking for a funny movie that also makes you think i highly suggest you quickly run to your local video store and find this movie i would tell you some of my favorite parts but that might ruin the film for you so i won't this movie is definitely on my top list of good movies do you really think nothing is bouncy
the first installment of this notorious horror series presents a woman being kidnapped by a gang of black-clad men who torture her for several days before finally killing is beaten around in the chair her finger nails guts are thrown at boiling water is poured on her and finally her eyeball is punctured with a sick and nasty makers of this unforgettable torture show tried to make it as real as possible and for me this one is the closest thing to a snuff film you can get without committing murder on course some of the special effects are rather poor but the idea of making a snuff is pretty have seen also flowers of flesh and blood which is more gory and less one is a must-see for horror fans
this film could have been a silent movie it certainly has the feel of one i was extremely extremely lucky to see this very rare version of this film extase is a symphony of love and transcends all language versions french which is the ultimate romantic language seems quite suitable for this very sensual and lyrical young hedy lamarr lights up the screen in this film which in a way is almost like a sex fantasy but definitely far from being qualities may have been a little crude but that does not detract from the magical spell this film lovers of early cinema would absolutely adore this film
i thought the movie was fairly well done for a made for tv movie and it contained both a lot of action and humor i found the entertainment value worth watching and would watch it again or a similar show again i'm disappointed that sean was not credited here on can see a possibility for an action series based on this concept or a sequel with sean once again playing for even higher cash stakes since his life would be on the line again felt that sean played the role very well and reminds me of an actor by the name of matthew ashford who plays jack deveraux on days of our lives the soap opera
this oscar nominee is a very short film in spanish a young woman goes into a café gets a coffee and notices a couple of musicians standing silently with their instruments all the patrons are motionless like mannequins one guy however is quite jolly and breaks into a song about what goes on at in the morning there is one surprising moment after another until the end which is quite well surprising the people the place everything looks quite ordinary and like the musical piece bolero the thing keeps building until the climax with its structure and is an minute masterpiece
massive multiple chills down the spine i'm surprised people who didn't like it i saw it at o'clock in the morning and still got scared stiff and i've seen hundreds of movies for crying out i mean ok voice acting not particularly good probably even b-movie-ish but the genuine look of terror the sound effects the flow from the very start hitting you again and again with relentless unforgiving terrorising scenes so many clichés yet none fails to you know coming coming coming boo and you still jump off the chair grab a pillow and a blanket call your closest friend over and do not watch it at night hats off to the japanese
i thought this movie would be dumb but i really liked it people i know hate it because spirit was the only horse that talked well so what the songs were good and the horses didn't need to talk to seem human i wouldn't care to own the movie and i would love to see it again
i managed to tape this off my satellite but i would love to get an original release in a format we can use here in the states eddie truly is glorious in this performance from san francisco i don't remember laughing so hard at a stand up routine my wife and i both enjoyed this tape and his work on glorious i just wish i could buy a copy and help support eddie financially through my purchase we need more of his shows available
a great ensemble cast a fond remembrance of younger carefree days this movie takes me back to when i went to summer camp indian summer while full of practical jokes and pranks is about growing up and coming to terms with life with middle-age life my family i thoroughly enjoyed this movie
i loved this exiting republic serial the story was one of the best i have ever seen even tough the picture quality was not of the best but ok the fencing in this serial is also a bit bad but not terrible they only should have practised some more as i said the story is great you're just sitting there and waiting to find out who don del oro is the theme music is excellent the same guy who maid the music for walt version of zorro who maid the fightin legion music costumes and buildings are very good zorro is really cool and so are the legioners i highly recommend this serial buy it love that reed hadley plays zorro he is funny smart and brave mark
this movie has a special way of telling the story at first i found it rather odd as it jumped through time and i had no idea whats the story line was although simple but still very real and touching you met someone the first time you fell in love completely but broke up at last and promoted a deadly agony who hasn't go through this but we will never forget this kind of pain in our life would say i am rather touched as two actor has shown great performance in showing the love between the characters i just wish that the story could be a happy ending
this film reinvents the term spring breakumentary hans the fat one of the group displays his talents as this generations chris farley johnny kansas the king of the bet shows not in kansas anymore by consistently upping the stakes laugh is truly infecting and offers a little eye-candy for the ladies as well does matt the dwarfs while having their moments did not do justice to the mexican hat dance like it deserves and last we have our protagonist ed he gives hope to all of us bumbling stumbling gangly pale folk who are still searching for that special someone and that hope is a little place called cabo san lucas while this blockbuster just missed the theaters this is a must rent as we can all relate to one of these spring breakumentarions
i used to love watching sabrina the teenage witch friday nights on tgif i think this was one of the best shows on tgif my friends and i used to get together every friday just to watch this show and we never missed an favorite character was salem he was adorable and sooo funny i liked boyfriend harvey too he was hot i think melissa joan hart played a good teenage witch too my favorite episodes were sabrina through the looking glass and hilda and zelda the teenage years those episodes were i really miss this show i hope one day abc brings it back with new episodes i give this show stars
a great british indy movie fantastic chemistry between the main characters make for some hilarious drug-fuelled set pieces that cheech and chong would be proud of great to see phil daniels back on the big screen if he has swapped sides since quadrophenia and gary stretch is surprisingly good and a treat for the ladies loved the final fight scene with nod to zulu and now i know what happened to arthur brown after he set himself on fire on top of the not really is a bona-fide british hippie you don't have to be a biker to enjoy this and straight into my friday night post-pub repeat viewing collection this film a go and you won't be disappointed
i have to admit i wasn't expecting much going into this film viewing in my japenese film class but this film really blew me away the director does a wonderful job following through with the title of his film truly portraying a picture of madness i think the fact that this film is silent adds to the resemblance of madness helping the viewer experience the characters inner world rather than the world outside his mind this film just added to my feelings about foreign silent films vs american in that the foreign films work much more to exercise your mind and make you think rather than going for the fluffy film always with the happy ending exercising the imagination very little
a sweet and totally charming film shall we dansu made me laugh and cry at first appearance sugiyama-san was not terribly uptight salaryman seemingly devoted to his family but all too easily captivated by a face in a window the object of his obsession is distant and cold but by the end of the movie i was in love with him her his wife and daughter all the dance instructors and dance students this uncomplicated story of transformation and renewal is a little jewel that i would enjoy seeing again
stack should have received the academy award for this performance period its a crime that he did not amazing how he humanizes a rich worthless character malone did earn a well-deserved academy award for her performance in fact all of the acting in this film is plot begins with a taxi ride then an airplane ride then keeps moving on an emotional ride that will hold your interest throughout you will be this is only a blatant soap opera one-dimensional soaper you might call it the ultimate soaper because the acting so thoroughly triumphs over the material excellently acted well directed but strictly within its soap genre i wouldn't even call it a melodrama as mildred pierce or imitation of life while not denying the great entertainment value of this film you can only imagine what this talented cast and director might have achieved with more substantial subject matter
what a relief to find out i am not imagining this programme the summary from taxman is great i too remember finding it haunting and not particularly family viewing i must have been at the time i watched it i think for a girl that age part of attraction was very blond hair and his permanently sad state the theme was played on a flute i recall although i cannot remember how it went i think the intro showed him playing it or maybe he played a flute in the programme and especially when he was sad maybe i am destined never to know how it ended or to see clip or hear the tune but at least i now know it is not just me
i've seen this movie and i must say i'm very impressed there are not much movies i like but i do like this one you should see this movie by yourself and comment this is one of my most favorite movie i fancy to see this again action fused with a fantastic story very impressing i like character actually very mystic and mysterious do like the bad boy is pretty too well actually this whole movie is rare in movieworld i considered about the vote of this movie i thought this is should be a very popular movie i guess wrong it was me who was very impressed about this movie and i hope i'm not the only one who takes only the cost to watch this one see and vote
we showed this movie at the local film society and the art-house crowd had the time of their cinematic lives tasteless groovy and very funny in a sixties kind of way the kraft kitchen recipe sketch had them laughing like maniacs the rest is a mixed bag but the highs definitely beat the lows by the way whatever happened to ken shapiro
in addition to being an extremely fun movie may i add that the costumes and scenery were wonderful this kind fun loving woman had a great deal of money unfortunately she also had two greedy daughters who were anxious to get their hands on her money this woman was lonely since the death of her husband he had proposed to her in a theater that was going to be torn down to prevent that she bought it her daughters were afraid she was throwing away their money and decided to take action the character actors in this film were a great plus also i would give almost anything to have a copy of this film in my video library but as of yet never been released sad
dick clement and ian la frenais have a solid hit rate as far as their tv work is concerned however their film work has been much more chequered the bank job was fine the previous across the universe decidedly weak for crazy fortunately is a solid success it has a great story excellent performances a lot of humour fabulous music and above everything else real savour moments and this film has one of them just when everything is going pear-shaped at the festival reunion enjoyable
this is a film about deep and unspoken human they do become spoken but is there a chance to change anything about the made in shanghai and quite free of propaganda the film introduces us to the dai family there is still some weight about the history that surrounds the family history usually has weight in chinese literature and serious young married couple liyan an invalid and his wife yuwen live in a once great family compound that is partially bright contrast is young sister who cannot really remember the past of the family but accepts everything in quite a natural way her spirit is as bright as the other two are this apparently stable world comes an unexpected ended up feeling quite sad but definitely a superior film
after seeing several movies of villaronga i had a pretty clear opinion about him he concentrates too much on the personal aspect of the characters forgetting about a rhythm of the movie that is why though having good critics his movies never caught the broad audience attention in aro he follows the same line but really improved on the rhythm especially in the end of the movie frankly speaking i slept through the first part cause though the first part gives necessary information it is really slow nevertheless the second part is absolutely marvelous and makes the whole movie the best movie ever made by
i went to this movie expecting an artsy scary film what i got was scare after scare a horror film at core not dull like other horror films where a haunted house just has ghosts and gore this film doesn't even show you the majority of the deaths it shows the fear of the characters i think one of the best things about the concept where not just the house thats haunted its whoever goes into the house they become haunted no matter where they are office buildings police stations hotel rooms etc after reading some of the external reviews i am really surprised that critics didn't like this film i am going to see it again this week and am excited about gave this film stars because it did what a horror film should it scared the out of me
the scene where sally field and whoopi goldberg go to the mall to revive flagging spirits is enough reason alone to enjoy this movie but wait more this is a crackling good sendup of daytime tv movie stars on the way down up and the horrors of love robert downey jr shows the lighter side of his genius and cathy moriarty is splendid the dialogue is witty and the physical humor done with consummate skill this is a movie that will appeal to those who really enjoy the arts of acting directing and writing
drew barrymore was excellent in this film this role is the type of role you don't normally see drew play her typical role is as a woman looking for love the storyline is also holly is implicated in her murder she moves to she moves in with a guy who becomes her lover but her brother who is in a mental prison hospital for what they believe is murder is almost killed she is wrongfully accused it is then revealed to her lover that she has multiple personality disorder after that another woman becomes paranoid when around her in the end though they find out the truth
i look at this page and it seems disapproving to me to have to listen to someone ramble and rant at a real classic sure i agree to let everyone have their opinion but movie should not be missed by any classic horror watcher and should be seen many casual viewers around the world sure it has lost some of flair and greatness with age especially in todays world of cgi effects but not why you should like should like it because it actually is a scary movie even for standards overall ickyness will creep you out just as much as the original audiences so don't slam a classic if you haven't given it a chance watch it but not with a critical attitude watch it to have fun how it was originally intended
i thought this movie was very well done taking place in the mid everything looked accurate to me it was well cast and believable i don't usually care much for this type of movie because they just don't have any depth but i felt this movie delved in to the characters and you could feel how they felt you got to really know them and care about them it did take me back to my youth and let me reminiscent about a more innocent time this movie could be enjoyed by both male and female and by all age groups after the movie was over i wished there was a part two i wanted to know what happened to dani and her family this movie is bound to be a classic if you haven't seen it you should try to catch it when it is on tv or rent it
i saw this film premiere friday night in park city for sundance and was incredibly moved sitting in a theater and hearing first-hand the anguish soldiers go through was almost more than i could bear others in the audience were equally moved and while we wanted to turn away the least we could do was bear witness as these men and women shared their experience with us robert acosta paul rieckhoff sean huze and herold noel all veterans of the war in iraq and featured in the film were present while they may be home now you can tell this war is still inside them and probably always will be whether you support the war or not it is our duty to support the troops with something other than a bumper sticker see this film
while a bit preachy on the topic of progress as the saving grace of mankind this is still a stunning film that presages the science-fiction special effects blockbusters that would take another years to arrive on the silver screen it predicts the global chaos of wwii but expands on the premise by having the conflict last years and then tells the epic tale of struggle out from under the rubble and into the wilds of space the acting seems wooden and strangely sterile but this is perhaps a result of its contrast with the visuals which must have been utterly breathtaking at the time of the release and which still impress today this is a film not to be missed by anyone at all interested in the sf genre
i have been an admirer of edward work for years and it was such a pleasure to be able to see the man at work thanks to jennifer documentary the severe beauty of the ship-breaking yard in bangladesh the stone quarry in vermont the enormous assembly plant in china the beleaguered old neighbourhoods in shanghai that are just waiting to be torn down these landscapes are captured so well by the photographer and the times i thought of old tv documentaries on abandoned coal mines and plastic-mold factories the sort of stuff i grew up watching work has the great value of pointing out how the industrial activity has only shifted to asia it has not stopped the strangest scene for me was the computer scrap-yard somewhere in waste had a threatening air about it while the workers were very jovial
jane eyre has always been my favorite novel when i stumbled upon this movie version in the late i was ecstatic this is the best and most complete version of the book on film this version is a little long to sit through in one sitting but well worth it timothy dalton is amazing as rochester i was glad that they cast a normal looking actress clark as jane and not a glamorous person i love the sets and the location for anyone who is a true jane eyre fan this is the version to watch for those of you who are interested i just found this version on dvd i have watched my vhs copy almost to breaking so i was thrilled to find it on dvd
this hong kong filmed potboiler packs in more melodrama than worth of the young the restless this one is more of a throwback to the original emmanuelle goodbye emmanuelle than a d'amato sleazefest chai a stunning transformation from dour nurse to hot-to-trot streetwalker future italian porn illona staller who would later go by the name have sex with an hiv positive john holmes plays competition exotic locales and some decent soft-core scenes round this one out recommended for fans of the original emmanuelle of which i am one
i just got this video used and i was watching it last night the acting started out extremely bad but got very good soon after wards the tornadoes looked extremely fake and many of the cgi effects were very dodgy but the scene with the house cracking apart and the contents inside being blown around and sucked out were extremely well done and just about on par with movies like twister the scenes of devastation were also extremely well done too the story was very well written and refreshing to see a movie like this stray away from the same old disaster formulas movies of this genre seems to have been stuck in for this movie had a very weird mix of fx and acting quality this merits an a in my book
the plot had some wretched unbelievable twists however the chemistry between mel brooks and leslie ann warren was excellent the insight that she comes to there are just moments provides a philosophical handle by which anyone could pick up and embrace was one of several moments that were wonderfully memorable
this is probably one of the worst movies ever made but so good probably best if you don't watch it expecting a gripping plot and something fantastically clever and entertaining because you're going to be disappointed however if you want to watch it so you can see million vases and fantastic english you're in for a real treat the harder you think about the film the worse it gets unless you're having a competition to spot the most plot ups in which case you've got hours of entertainment ahead i'd only really recommend this film for the bored or the die-hard smap fans and even then the latter should be a bit careful because japanese fans were a bit upset about it they thought he was selling himself out wasn't really not when johnny kitagawa was the executive producer can do that for him
this is a smart drama about the way of life in a texas honky tonk in the early john travolta and debra winger turn out two very believable performances as bud and sissy davis this film really opens up the country music scene and helped introduce america to the mechanical bull if you love a good romance film then you will love this movie
nice to see a film with real people with honest feelings sissy spacek is so absolutely convincing as a simple yet nice daughter to robert finally in his last role gets to show what a fine actor he was it is hard to believe that this is a david lynch film it is slow and even sweet and moving one of the best unless you like car chases sex scenes and violence
i really enjoyed this debut by ring director hideo nakata if you've seen ring beforehand then you'll be familiar with the style and idea of this flick got a subtle spookiness about it that works better than the constant predictable stingers that infest most mainstream movies of this genre if you like films that give you the chills then you will probably like this one a good creepy debut by hideo nakata
saw it as many times as i could before it left the scene a delightful and entertaining film with some of my very favorite stars only wish i could find it again would certainly it if i could please somebody bring it back fred macmurray was perfect in his role as a patriot during world war ii and his leading ladies joan leslie and especially june haver were beautiful and charming it was a musical but also romantic funny and clever this was my favorite movie starring june haver although i always liked her her dazzling smile lit up the screen and her beauty and talent were an asset to any film the supporting cast lent credit to their individual roles a well-balanced and light-hearted film only wish we had more like it
this video is so hilariously funny it makes everything eddie murphy seem very disappointing beverly hills cop and the nutty professor which just goes to show you how good this really is to be honest i don't think that i've at something as much as this including naked gun and the rarely seen bargearse this show is amazing although it must be said that it is certainly filled with the word beginning with f that is four letters long its extended version beginning with m but it didn't bother me see it the funniest thing i've ever seen and probably the funniest you ever have too
i've also been looking to find this movie for quite some time and how great it would be to find it on saw this movie when i was about years old in the netherlands and i was very impressed by it it was shown before walt jungle book i remember of this movie is fragmented i remember that an indian boy was friends with an eagle this impressed me very much for some reason he was thrown out of his village not grasp the reason for this when other boys threw stones at him he climbed a rock and jumped off at that time he turned into an eagle and flew away with his eagle friend as an eagle he was still wearing his turquoise necklace
a great concept a great cast and what a pity there wasn't more time to flesh out the story i loved it and wanted more dench dukakis and laine now there are some real women still dench and her character alone had enough substance to carry the script over some of its lesser moments i have it on tape and will continue to watch it hoping that there is a clue at the end that suggests there will be a drawer no question no
i have loved this movie since i first saw it in i'm still amazed at how accurately kurt russell portrays elvis right down to how he moves and the expressions on his face sometimes its scary how much he looks acts and talks like the real elvis thankfully this is being released on dvd so all of us that have been waiting can finally have an excellent quality version of the full length film i have heard the detractors who say that there are some inaccuracies or some things left out but i think that keeping in mind that john carpenter only had about hours to work with and that this was being shown on television two years after death that he did a fine job with this in fact i haven't seen another elvis movie that even comes close to this one highly recommended
we're talking about a low budget film and understandable that there are some weaknesses spoilers one sudden explosives expert and one meaningless alcoholic but in general the story keeps you interested most of the characters are likable and there are some original situations really like films that surprise you with some people that are not who they want you to believe and then twist and turn the plot i applaud this one on that you know what i mean try to see also nueve reinas queens a film from argentina
i can only agree with taximeter that this is a fantastic film and should be seen by a wide audience the imagination on display the visual interpretation of the script the humor is constantly surprising the two leads are great and really carry the film my advice would be to not even watch a trailer just rent the film and watch without expectations i rented from blockbuster so it is readily available in brisbane not everyone will enjoy it but i think most people will have an opinion and always good unless just that was stupid i loved this film you just don't get to see like this every day this should become a cult favorite give it a try you may just feel the same way about it as i do
a river runs through it is one of those movies that deserves to be seen in the theater so that the majesty of its cinematography can be truly appreciated the acting is wonderful and understated with every gesture and smile and nod carrying meaning brad pitt gives a radiant performance and tom skerrit is powerful as the preacher father the movie moves like a river you have to be willing to follow it through ebbs and flows but it is well worth it in the end
why are the previews so blah for a movie that is so awesome everyone should know what an excellent movie this is it is engaging and funny from moment one original and well-acted i wish the movie was doing itself as good press as it anyone that loved the princess bride labyrinth and other truly funny and original fantasy adventure this is one of the great ones robert deniro is hysterical relative newcomer charlie cox is an incredible leading man claire danes is fantastic as always michelle pfiefer is making quite a splash with her recent returns to the screen there are also a lot of wonderful moments from minor down to facial expressions
this is a wonderfully written and well acted psychological drama it is not really a horror flick so those looking for something like the ring or the grudge will be disappointed what really surprised me about this film was the intelligence and subtle attention to detail in the plot and the effort made to be internally consistent i also appreciated the absence of dr phil psychobabble or new age revisionism rather than advancing an agenda the filmmakers just told the story told it well and let the viewer think about it the sparse dreamscapes were reminiscent of wyeth paintings and amazingly effective great example of how to make a good film on a small budget without big studios star actors big-name directors was far better than many of films special effects or clever plot twists
this is one of the unusual cases in which a movie and the novel on which it is based are both great maybe this is because gorris takes initial ideas and gives them a different interpretation the final consequence is a point of view over luzhin which dignifies him more than the only thing in the movie which i don't like is the influence of on destiny i can't imagine nabokov creating a person like valentinov and giving him so great influence on argument
marlon brando and frank sinatra hated each other while doing this film and in the years following asked sinatra for some singing sinatra was already upset over the fact that he was cast as nathan he wanted the part of skye to be the star singer in the production and didn't want any one to be better than he told brando to get to get back at him marlon kept screwing up the scene in the diner where sinatra was eating cheesecake so that he would have to keep and the later gave brando the nickname mumbles or because of the way he talks
in loving memory of david tomlinson i watched this movie for the first time i was years old and i got fascinated by this story of witches in the world war the scene which impressed me the most was the fight between the nazi soldiers and the medieval army it was exceptional to see this army without a body walk to fight the astonished singing their march this movie is fantastic from the trip to portobello road became to me the most fantastic place of london to the journey to naboomboo angela lansbury and david tomlinson are really a fantastic couple she is always great it seems the good aunt of a family and david with his always astonished face is her great co-protagonist we'll miss him a lot
ask yourself where she got the gun remember what she was taught about the mindset when the con is over the gun had blanks and it was provided to her from the very the patient comes back at the end she was supposed to see him drive away in the red convertible and lead her to the gang splitting up her patient was in on the con from the does not die in the end the gun had enough spoilers for you there this is why people are giving it such high ratings extremely original because of the hidden ending and how it cons most of the audience
if you have a chance of seeing this film do see it quite shocking in parts and really makes you think about so many important issues but not didactic in my opinion a piece of art beautifully filmed fine music of many styles the typically impressive level of acting that one has come to expect from bbc drama nathalie press as natalie press is convincing in her role as depressed teenager exploited by a male classmate celia imrie has that beautifully reassuring quality that gives the sometimes unnerving action stability and the viewer comfort in the knowledge that someone out there is actually normal but the real star as always is timothy spall surely one of the greatest actors of our time
i enjoyed watching cliffhanger at the beginning when that woman was full of terror when she was slipping i thought that was a terrifying scene as i would think that when you see that see your nerves in your body get to you because it makes you get full of fright and your heart beats faster i did like watching cliffhanger i think silvestar stallone is a great actor and i think he'll be known as playing rambo and rocky
right the movie is better than the book don't get me wrong i love the book but the movie is just so much better this film has jack nicholson and shelly duvall at their best haven't seen scatman crothers and obviously danny lloyd in anything else some of the ideas used in this movie are better than the ones used in the book but i already talked about those in my comment on the mini series but i missed a few the film is shot at a better location than where the mini series was shot and the redrum scenes are creepier than those in the book so if you're looking for a great movie get stanley the shining but count on having nightmares every night for weeks
ettore scola one of the most refined and grand directors we worldly citizens have is not yet available on dvd summer right now mysteries to goggle the mind grand classic returned to the theaters in my home-town thanks to a sophia loren summer-retrospective and to see it again on the big screen after all these years of viewing it on a video-tape it is a true gift avoid a critique but nonetheless try to prove a point i took my reluctant younger brother with me to see this film he never saw the film before and doesn't like those italian oldies like all the others in the theater he was intrigued by this wonder even during the end-titles the theater remained completely silent special day is truly special a wonder of refinement and a big loss if you haven't seen it
i've always enjoyed seeing chuck norris in film although the acting may not be superb the fight scenes are fantastic i also enjoyed seeing judson mills perform along side him in my opinion the norris brothers have proven themselves to be fine entertainers and this was yet another fine production i hope you take the time to view this movie
home room was a great movie if you've ever had drama in your life it keeps you wanting to see more wondering what the secret alicia is hiding i think i watched that movie times in a row and never lost interest plus i usually don't cry over movies but this one made me cry each time i wish i could find more movies like that one all in all i thought it was a great movie the more you watch of it the more you become part of it the very end is the part that really got me when she cried when getting her diploma because it had her name on it my heart felt as if it had shattered just then and how her new friend came to comfort her when she hadn't gotten hers yet i loved it so much
been quite some time since i've watched this lotr i am currently hunting for a copy to purchase work is quite true to the original work the visuals are engrosing and sometimes occasionally the movie is confusing or muddled there are one or two times where the storyline slows to a crawl but overall buy this movie great for kids adults and collectors
i took part in a little mini production of this when i was a bout at school and my mum bought the video for me i've loved it ever since when i was younger it was the songs and spectacular dance sequences that i enjoyed but since i've watched it when i got older i appreciate more the fantastic acting and character portrayal oliver reed and ron moody were brilliant i can't imagine anyone else playing bill sykes or fagin shani wallis nancy if the best character for me she put up with so much for those boys i think such a strong character and her final scene when well you know always makes me cry best musical in my opinion of all time lasted all this time it will live on for many more years to come
this a great disney is the story of an aging high school baseball was once on his way to the big leagues as a suffered a career ending through series of a try out with a major league team and even makes the is a great family is doesn't pour it on too fun and will enjoy this movie as well as is based upon a true i'm sure the filmmakers took some liberties in telling the is sensational as the title you're looking for a film the whole family can no
i liked this and found this film to be a good family dirtiest part of this movie was when it made references to the new york yankees you have to be in red sox nation to understand that ny yankees is a dirty to say that to the recommend this picture for the entire course with your typical a long moment in the i'm in love and what do i the movie makes up for that with all the slapstick movie some moments of how the red sox in fenway the fans felt about years of the sox always screwed up at the end of the season and how the love of the sox and the love with another human go hand to hand
in my opinion the best movie ever i love when people ask me what this film is about i usually smile and say life they shrug and probably never give it another thought the fact that everyone from every background can relate to some part of this movie makes it all that much more amazing definately a must see for everyone
in brave new girl holly comes from a small town in texas sings the yellow rose of texas at a local competition and gets admitted to a prestigious arts college in philadelphia from there the movie grows into a colorful story of friendship and loyalty i loved this movie it was full of great singing and acting and characters that kept it moving at a very nice pace the acting was of course wonderful virginia madsen and lindsey haun were outstanding as well as nick roth the camera work was really done well and i was very pleased with the end seems a sequel could be in the making kudos to the director and all others that participated on this production quite a gem in the film archives
just saw this at the vancouver international film festival and it was funny as hell and a bit surreal takes place in toronto where these two losers live in this run-down house in the middle of a freeway system david hewlett cube cypher and andrew miller are just great as the two losers who wish the world would just go away the acting dialogue and writing are very good and the whole film looks great for such a low-budget flick vincenzo natali was in attendance at this screening and he seemed so intelligent and down-to-earth this guy is so inventive with these great stories that work so well within small budgets it puts big budget hollywood crap to shame
this animation tv series is simply the best way for children to learn how the human body works yes this is biology but they will never tell it truly think this is the best part of this stream of educational cartoons i do remember you can find little books and a plastic body in several parts skin skeleton and of course in the same stream you'll find il était une fois l'homme which relate the human history from the big bang to the century there is il était une fois l'espace as well the space and its exploration but that one is more a fiction than a description of the reality since it takes place in the future
to me this was more a wake up call and realization that most all we see hear read and think about most anything is dependent on what the media feeds us this is a classic example of high level spin doctors attempting to control the masses through controlled information it is also an excellent example of how people that have a constitution that they freely bought in to will not be swayed by this media control or any attempted mis-information once again this shows that at the end of the day the needs of the many will in fact outweigh the needs of the few it is also enlightening to see that in in a country where there is no religious civil war going on that democracy is not a real hard thing to implement
here on i read an opinion that grey owl is best character of pierce brosnan ever performed i do not know if he had better nor worse roles i'm not his fan but this one was really other thing impressive hand of the movie director i give my respect the serenity the beauty and spirit of wilderness was illustrated really exlusively i never met such proximity it in any movie thing left in my mind after the film this is the movie closest to the original books and atmosphere in it little bit more i pay my respect to the original grey owl
i have probably seen this movie over fifty times by now because of the kids they just cant get enough of spirit the best thing about the movie i think is that the animals isn't able to talk this makes the whole movie more honest and makes a better impression on both kids and the adults so from the kids and me
this is hands down the greatest stand up show ever i've seen a lot of stand up shows been to a lot of stand up shows and watch comic view but i have never seen anyone who could match the skills of murphy on this show the impressions are excellent the skits are great and the timing is perfect you can even tell the crowd gets really into when he did raw a few years later it was also really good but this is in my book also shows that at one time particularly the early-to mid eighties that murphy was funny my favorite parts of the show is when he is retelling the family barbecue and ice cream mooommmm the ice cream man is coming another great part is where his mom is like clint eastwood
i remember seeing this on tv in the late and it stayed with me charming loud colourful a great kids film i put it on for some friends at a party recently and naturally they thought i was mad and expected something sick to happen to the puppets a la meet the feebles but no its wholesome clean wild is in fine form as is mama cass and the somehow attractive witchy you like the banana splits and you are in your this will re-create that surreal childhood saturday morning if i've realised now that puf himself is a bit crap as all he does is get captured and run away quality tv movie if like me you are into death metal you'll love it
ah made another gangster film with statham thought the average fan expecting another stock expecting perhaps a couple of temporal shifts but none too hard for me and the lads to swallow after a few pay attention you do need to watch this film no cups of tea no extra diet cokes from the counter no keep it running shouts as you nip to the fridge watch the film no laughs other than those you may make yourself from the considerable violence if that floats your boat so be it but sharp solid direction excellent dialogue and great favourite big pussy from the sopranos always a reliable hood
opening credits great music just right for this film cinematography sleazy to great excitement in a train-wreck sort of way this is how out of control some lives can become wonderland depicts drug-induced wildness its consequences not as an aberration but shows how it really does happen in our society it is better than depictions of another wild group because all manson films books etc concentrate so much on insane mind rather than the overall picture of the cheap fame and randomness that is so pervasive you want to see some of the best method-acting on film watch kilmer in this movie he shows how the method can be riveting in the right filmmakers here succeed in raising out-of-control to the level of an art form not just for the sake of giving us cheap thrills
this film was absolutely brilliant every performance in this film is excellent especially jake gyllenhaal and chris cooper it looks like mr gyllenhaal will have a huge film career if this is anything to go by i thought that joe johnston was an odd choice as director as he is usually associated woth big budget honey i shrunk the kids he pulls of every scene with sheer class my favourite scene was where homer is going down the mineshaft and looking at the sky going down as all of his dreams were it was beautiful joe johnston should direct more of these brilliant acting driven films as well as his big budget blockbuster faire which is also excellent kudos to all involved in this masterpiece
i saw this jolly little film at age in when it was broadcast on cbs i didn't know it had been in a theater at all to rate it from a kids point of view i'd give it out of being a young boy at the seemed a little climactic scene where gazooks tickles the daylights out of everyone was a bit disturbing at the time but you outgrow that sort of thing i re-discovered it a blockbuster video in had to revisit it i still liked it despite the fact that it looked a bit old i don't know where the other reviewer on here got the idea that it wasn't on out there might even be on dvd by least i hope it is i want to share it with my kids someday stars on still a great kids film finally found a vhs copy woo-hoo
the ramones whom i consider the founders of modern punk rock lend their then-unique sounds to a terrifically twisted movie about a rowdy rock fan soles who faces off against a merciless joyless principal woronov for the right to a soundtrack brimming with incredible music rrhs is fascinating in concept and execution chock full of riotous sight gags the mouse experiment teenage spirit my all-time favorite film opening and bizarre off-the-wall moments straitjacket scenes if you're looking for a movie that seems to be made of pure fun on a molecular level look no further but if you're looking for a nice dignified dramatic epic maybe you should look a wee bit everybody i'm riff randell and this is rock roll high school
one of the very best three stooges shorts ever a spooky house full of evil guys and the goon challenge the alert detective best men shemp is in top form in the famous in-the-dark scene emil sitka provides excellent support in his mr goodrich role as the target of a murder plot before over trusty little shovel is employed to great effect this minute gem moves about as fast as any short and packs twice the wallop highly recommended
comparable to fight club the matrix sixth sense among others this film approaches the psyche in a way never done before the first minutes builds a interesting love story between diaz-cruise-cruz the rest of the movie is well confusing you'll pick more every time you watch it gone to the movies to see it times now
i recently stumbled across this film on tnt five minutes into it while on vacation in florida there has to be some down time in the hotel right i was initially surprised to see melissa joan hart in any feature length film on tnt i mean drive me crazy isn't that old already is i stuck with it and was thoroughly surprised and entertained melissa plays her role as the psychotic jennifer excellently the supporting cast the ex-con boyfriend karen her best friend and her life-controlling parents all added a great degree of believability the twist at the end was a nice closure to this tale of the girl who always seemed to be one step ahead of you get a chance check it
i was very fond of this film it kept me guessing till just before the very end what would happen one of the better movies about the partition that i have seen urmila matondkar is gorgeous too this is one of the most personal and down-to-earth films i've seen on the partition a little less mainstream than gadar and is really an emotional roller coaster where you start out with one opinion of what is going on and come out completely one the other side this isn't typical bollywood fare but rather an art-house type film the best part of this movie is that it doesn't dehumanize one side of the partition conflict when focusing on the story of another it doesn't blame or castigate but rather lets you draw your own conclusions about things
i found it highly intellectual and artistic in every way i felt that the script was conveying all the things i feel physically and emotionally when i got home from work and watched it this is a tribute to cinema in the highest form and guacamole how i wish those days would come again i tried putting a bubble window on the side of my car civic but the vacuum formed muffin trays didn't quite cut it also in my civic sexual positions are limited and are not supported by water bed as is brilliantly depicted in the van is of the utmost side splitting hilarity and can even substitute for porn if you watch some scenes highly anticipate that sam grossman director has achieved his john sam
as someone who lives near buffalo new york this movie scored points with me before i even saw it since the story is based here there are even some bit parts with real-life news-tv anchor people from for once it doesn't knock the area puh-leeze god is still made to look and think like of course be a bit on the liberal side being the lightweight comedy it is nothing that should win any awards but it still is entertaining and is a pleasant way to kill minutes are some laugh-out-loud slapstick comedy scenes and hopefully audiences from christians to got something out of this besides a few laughs such as what prayer should really be all about kudos to the writers for at least getting that theology correct and giving a good a good-hearted film that should offend very few
bette midler is indescribable in this concert she gives her all every time she is on stage whether we are laughing at her jokes and antics or dabbing our eyes at the strains of one of her tremendous ballads bette midler moves her audience if you can't see it live is the best way to see bette then this is the next best thing an interesting thing to look at is how incredible her voice has changed and matured over the years but never lost its power her more vocally correct version of stay with me never loses anything in spirit from the rose or divine madness here it is just more pure and as heartfelt as ever i will treasure this concert for a very long time
this is a cleaver film featuring love through the ages the film consists of keaton seeking out a lady love in the stone age in ancient rome and in the present in all three cases he is the usual wimpy buster and he battles against wallace beery for his lady love of the three time periods i think i liked the roman one best even though i admit it might have also been the cheesiest i actually liked the scenes with the lion that was obviously a guy in a costume as well as the weird chariot race in the what i really enjoyed the most was seeing all of amazing acrobatics however all three time periods were good old fashioned fun and the film while not his best is still an exceptional and enjoyable film check it out
but worth watching for boyer lorre and paxinou entertainments that were filmed during the war either required transplanting to american shores as in this gun for hire or the use of american actors in roles where they did not fit bacall fits that part here i kept waiting for her to whistle and bring bogie to life her tone of voice is simply all wrong for an upper class englishwoman but listen to the dialogue no people don't talk that way except in books but greene was sending a message about an england that needed to wake up to the dangers of the world one other positive note range of characters were kept whole while mr mukerjee resembled more a brahamin at least his nationality was kept and his final conversation with paxinou is priceless
gandhi my father is like viewing a book chapter by chapter you read your eyes and you learn more about harilal gandhi and for that matter kasturba gandhi so little is known about both of them and this movie describes them uniquely the title misleads though its as much a movie about mohandas karamchand gandhi and his son as its about harilal and his mother and akshaye khanna and shefali chayya do full justice to their respective movies are like leap years they come after only so much my father is also about an internal struggle which is sometimes more difficult than any freedom struggle ever it if you like quality cinema
i saw this movie at an advance screening and found it york i love you is a true spin on a romance that explores clever funny and sometimes shocking situations around the human most powerful cast is huge a veritable oceans with andy garcia ethan hawke shia labouf natalie portman bradley cooper and others they all give stand out performances in one way or not to mention that there is a who of directors interweaving stories in clever and interesting ways brett rattner shaka kapur natalie portman i mean this movie is not a straight ahead romance or romantic comedy even though it is both romantic and funny it also has serious stories and notes but good in my opinion go see it for yourself and reply to my review i want to hear what others have to say
the extended nuclear family united in business as well as in personal life is examined in this serious study of a grown conflict with his desire that he remain in the family business this triggers a midlife crisis which may or may not be ameliorated by an affair and retreat to a couch very fine acting by all a sleeper that deserves wide attention
eddie murphy is one of the funniest comedians ever probably the funniest delirious is the best stand-up comedy i've ever seen and it is a must-have for anyone who loves a good laugh i've watched this movie hundreds of times and every time i see it i still have side-splitting fun this is definitely one for your video library i guarantee that you will have to watch it several times in order to hear all the jokes because you will be laughing so much that you will miss half of them delirious is there are a lot of funny comedians out there after watching this stand-up comedy most of them will seem like second-class citizens if you have never seen it get it watch it and you will love it it will make you holler
i have seen a couple movies on eating disorders but this one was definitely my favorite one the problem with the other ones was that the people with the eating disorders towards the end just automatically get better or accept the fact that they need help and thats it this movie i thought was more realistic cause in this one the main character lexi doesn't automatically just get better she gets better and then has a drawback i think this movie shows more than the others that i've seen that getting better doesn't just happen hard work and takes time a long path to recovery i think this movie shows all of that very well there should be more movies like this
i love this movie jouvet arletty blier carné almost everything has already been said about the movie but there is one detail i'd like to shed some light onto no footage of the real still standing hôtel du nord it still i heard it was to be demolished has been used for the movie the whole scene has been rebuilt on set the main reason being that they could not stop the traffic on the st martin canal for several weeks
the scarecrow was on of the funniest killers i have ever seen in the act plus really bouncy most of the time he jumped around which was awesome also he had an excellent voice i mean it was just perfect for him the story lines was excellent too i like how the kids soul was transferred into scarecrow that was cool plus he did have a reason for all that killing i mean after what those people did to would be angry too scarecrows look was really good his look gives that person an omg reaction when they see him which was great the stares he got were funny those people were stupid who would stare for that long they should of glanced and ran for their though that wouldn't of made a difference
fifteen years later and paris is burning is still aflame this is a classic in black gay films right up there with the other honorary black gay films the color purple and mahoganoy this seminal work captures underground and underclass black and latin gay culture and community like no other work before or since including all the sentimental harlem rennaissance gay retrospectives and renderings they're good but this is the best i say the only real film you'll find on the subject relentlessy cunty classic house music to hollywood non-stop hilarious camp only we do it and dead-on social critique all this by a white female director obviously must have been a sister gurl or mizz thing in a former life i could go on but i think you get the point by now i love this movie
i totally disagree with the other basically took a chance on this movie and was glad that i couldn't find anything wrong with script is actors are all likable and smart reminded me of marcia brady from the brady this gal truly can setting in the australian outback is soundtrack paul bless paul cranberries are also have seen this movie twice in less than will probably watch it is that makes one better than nine-tenths of the so-called hollywood blockbusters that were also out during this of beyond is a photographed couldn't find anything wrong with it first review
as noted by other reviewers this is one of the best tarzan movies unlike others however i like the beginning of the film as it feels like a pretty accurate depiction of what a trading post must have been like plus the exposition is needed so we know why harry wants to go back into the jungle in addition the beginning of the film contains one of the most thrilling and terrifying chase sequences ever occurs when safari group has to outrun a tribe of cannibals the pre-censorship production values add a lot of realism genuinely depicting the terrible dangers that awaited europeans going into the jungle the film also offers though perhaps antecedently an accurate account of how horribly treated the native africans were by their white employers in addition sexy jane thousands of elephants some great sets and two chetas not to be missed an adventure classic
i saw the movie recently during the boston film festival the movie was very entertaining and is something that i believe the world and black america is ready to see it has the soundtrack is great it is an all around good film the characters were well developed and the movie had a wide variety of prominent actors such as wood the titains paid in full brian j white mr and the wonderful zoe pirates of the caribbean the movie tackles many relevant topics in todays society in a short period of time and does so with class and grace this is not only a story about life in the hospital however it is a story about people and their personal journey to discovering who they are or who they are going to be
i'm no fan of newer movies but this one was a real pleasure to watch adults and children could watch it together how unusual my aunt liked it too it had laughter tears love adventure special effects good actors and a talking parrot it reminded me of a favourite the wizard of oz the hero paulie an intelligent parrot is separated from his home and family and goes through many adventures temptations and disappointments always keeping in mind his resolution to find his friend marie highly recommended
as i am always looking for something new and unique i watched this film online i thought that it would be just another b rate movie but i was amazed at the acting by the two main characters all of the actors in this film were very capable and well directed the plot was wonderful and unique as well with an excellent moral to the movie is definitely not for someone looking for a sex romp dumb and dumber or blood and guts this is a wonderfully poignant film showing some grim realities of life coupled with the kindness of the human heart and just enough frivolity to keep it would prefer this movie to many a rate movies i have seen even a great number with high box office highly recommend this movie
burlinson and thornton give an outstanding performance in this movie along with dennehy although it is at first thought to be only about love it really goes down deeper than that the beauty of nature captures this movie placing among one of the best i have ever seen the horse scenes are absolutely fantastic any horse-lovers out there will love this
i have seen dirty work several times and is probably my favourite stan and ollie this one stan and ollie are chimney sweeps and get the job to clean the chimney at the home of professor noodle littlefield while noodle is doing mad experiments in his lab stan and ollie cause much chaos trying to clean the chimney and make a mess of the living room the end is where ollie falls into a tank of special formula that noodle uses for his experiments and this turns him into a chimp the best part is where ollie falls down the chimney and loads of bricks land on his head but he doesn't seem to suffer much pain from work is stan and ollie at their funniest great stars out of
this is one of those movies that they did too much promoting for if you watch then you might as well not watch the movie almost all the funny scenes are spoiled in the previews except one which just happens to be jennifer annisten being the funny one it is typical jim carrey humor and it is really funny just don't go see this movie expecting to be surprised all in all if you like jim carrey or comedies this is a must-see otherwise just watch the previews and you'll be just as satisfied
is the best television show an incredible tv series with an incredible suspense excellent plots and unforgettable characters and the first episode of all is my best evidence because only the first episode only the introduction and you are hooked because of the plot and the continuous twists and bauer is a federal agent who is assigned the protection of the senator david palmer he can't trust in anybody because people of the ctu may be involved and when this events occurred his daughter kimberly escapes from house to a party the end of the episode you want to watch more and more and more only the first of the lot and excellent
i laughed a lot while watching this an amusing short with a fun musical act and a lot of wackiness the characters are simple but their simplicity adds to the humor stylization the dialog is funny and often unexpected and from the first line to the last everything just seems to flow wonderfully max who has apparently led a horrible life and edward who isn't sure what life he wants to lead my favorite character was tom insane boss tom has a short role but a memorable one highly recommended for anyone who likes silly humor and you can find it online now which is a bonus i am a fan of all of cartoons and can't wait to see what he comes out with next
good show very entertaining good marshal arts acting good story plot the entire main crew did a nice job from robert urich to chuck norris jennifer tung and especially a big hand to judson mills an especially fine tribute to robert urich in his latter days a great actor who will be truly missed
i just got puzzled why damn fox canceled the although was not as good as which is excellent like it so much that i even thinking about buying dvd on am a chinese student and inconvenient for me to get a international credit card and just hope fox can bring back da someday somehow
i have to admit right off the top i'm not a big fan of family films these days most of them imho are sentimental crap but this one like toy story the previous film from pixar is a lot of fun the two lead characters were perhaps a bit too compared to the two leads in antz but otherwise this film is better but the rest of the film more than made up for it the animation looked great the humor though broad was consistently especially liked line if i hadn't promised mother on her deathbed that i wouldn't kill you i would kill you and the actors doing the voices except the two leads were all leary doing an animated movie what a concept and like everyone else i loved the outtakes i hope the video has the new ones
i really enjoyed this movie it took a pretty dark story-that of and wrapped it in a quirky often funny and poignant modern to the way the filmmaker brought the very different worlds of modern nyc and scotland together under one roof the opposing worlds act bring out the intrigue and comedy of the play and you have to love harold perrineau as the chorus a part which doesn't exist in the play but really helps to jazz things up the ending stands out among little indies i've seen for closure and originality
i saw this movie when it first came out it was an official selection for the temecula valley international film festival and i voted for it for best priestley is hot as the psychotic but complex amanda this is not your ordinary psycho movie lots of interesting and original slants on the genre sort of a fatal attraction for the younger set with some great blues music mixed in as the object of affection is married to an up and coming blues singer who has less time for her husband as her career takes
don't waste time reading my review go out and see this astonishingly good episode which may very well be the best columbo ever written ruth gordon is perfectly cast as the scheming yet charming mystery writer who murders her son-in-law to avenge his murder of her daughter columbo is his usual rumpled befuddled and far-cleverer-than-he-seems self and this particular installment features fantastic chemistry between gordon and falk ironically this was not written by heralded creators levinson or link yet is possibly the densest most thoroughly original and twist-laden columbo plot ever utterly satisfying in nearly every department and overflowing with droll and witty dialogue and thinking truly unexpected and inventive climax tops all this one out on netflix

this is an excellent example of early bette davis talent the production is above average for timeframe i cannot understand why the owners of the rights to this film have not put it on dvd owners please please release it i would buy it immediately i have not seen it in more than thirty years on television but remember it well
often laugh out loud sometimes sad story of working divorced guys lemmon a neurotic clean house husband and matthau a slob sportswriter who decide to live together to cut down on expenses photographed and directed the script is very barbed that is always more than one side to almost every line particularly funny scene involves british sisters and shelley who seem amused by everything anyone says but when lemmon busts out his photos of kids and yes ex-wife-to-be he has the girls sobbing along with him before matthau can show up with the promised entertaining
when i was told of this movie i thought it would be another chick flick i was wrong this movie sends a powerful message about judging others i was deeply moved everyone i have encountered i have recommended this movie to no one has come back saying it was bad busy also did a great job with her role in this film i don't know much about her acting career but wow they way she pulled off the end of this fill was the beginning it was a little slow but after she went to the the movie picks up again i have no idea why this movie hasn't been spoken of in the movie world my wish would be for this movie to be released again and advertised it sends a powerful message in a mere hour and a half
blackadder is probably the blackadder series that people have least heard of it has basically the same principles as the second and fourth ones and has nothing revolutionary in it but it is still great a fiery duke of wellington and a fat foolish dr johnson of the first dictionary in england make this series one to be reckoned with there are still more hilarious one-liners to be delivered in this series and it brings out the humour in a lesser-known era in historically accurate and enjoyable episodes third outing is not the most famous and well-known of the lot but rowan role as a butler to a stupid prince is a funny and effectively done one and hugh laurie is at his best in this series very good
good historical drama which is very educational and also very entertaining to people who like good acting and as sensual and sexy as it is sometimes prepared to peek into the pioneer spirit and human ability to touching as well for the spiritually mature not for people who do not like to think
this is a top finnish film this tango kabaree comes director lampela made couple of years back another nice little film called rakastin epätoivoista naista was in love with a desperate is truly true-to-life beautiful film of one saturday afternoon in a little actors are maybe not so handsome or beautiful but they do act certainly do hope that many of them get jussi statue oscar next think this film could make it abroad as well
casomai is a masterful tale depicting the story of a young couple who wade through the murky waters of marriage the story is very believable in telling the strange see-saw between oblivion and continuous interference by others which is fairly typical in italy may wonder whether such happenings are different elsewhere though pavignano and d'alatri were very good at writing and that is one of the strong points of the movie acting by stefania rocca and fabio volo is sober and gripping and the figure of the sympathetic priest is funny and well-rounded all in all a truly deserving movie probably one of the best italian movies of the year
this is according to me a quite bizarre movie with a lot of humor in it i wouldn't say that it is very scary but more fun i guess that is if you like horror movies scarecrow kind of remembered me of children of the corn but still not if you compare these two movies this is much more fun to watch
this should be required viewing for all young people this is documentary at its best from the haunting music and terrific narration by olivier to its unflinching and penetrating analyses the world at war is unforgettable and irreplaceable for anyone who wants to know about sorry experience at the nadir of the century
okay i know this does'nt project india in a good light but the overall theme of the movie is not india shakti the power of a warlord and the power of a mother the relationship between nandini and her husband and son swallow you up in their warmth then things go terribly wrong the interaction between nandini and her father in law the power of their dysfunctional relationship and the lives changed by it are the strengths of this movie shah rukh performance seems to be a mere cameo compared to the believable desperation of karisma kapoor it is easy to get caught up in the love violence and redemption of lives in this film and find yourself heaving a sigh of relief and sadness at the climax the musical interludes are strengths believable and well done
film is designed to affect the audience and this film left me speechless gorgeously photographed and well acted with dialog that approaches poetry the film involves lust hate murder rape theft and deception it weaves an intense web that left me unable to take my eyes off the screen until the closing credits the story is sweeping it takes the audience from the atrocities of the spanish civil war to the human wreckage left behind roger casamajor and bruno bertanzoni are two young actors who command the screen supporting players are excellently cast and lend a real sense of authenticity sets lighting scenery and cinematography are wonderful i absolutely love the photography
this is an excellent movie the cast is a great mix of characters and the story is decent the movie is basically about a well-accomplished doctor stealing the bodies of dead brides and taking them to his home once the bodies are at his home he removes stuff hate to use such a general term but i forget what it was he removed and puts it into his wife to retain her youth then a reporter patricia hunter investigates the situation and begins to find answers on why the brides were dying she takes a trip to the doctors house and the interesting things begin to take place definitely watch this oldie but goodie if you can
michael bowen plays an innocentish young man who hitchhikes a thousand miles to visit his absentee millionaire father creepy ray wise at a sprawling windmill-powered ranch and ends up tangled in the dangerous web of his young scheming and seductive stepmother from hell yummy clare wren thus causing trouble for the already dysfunctional family an edgy stylish and exciting drama that received no promotion and was sent straight to vhs and cable i first saw it it is beautifully written smartly acted and tightly directed from a script that keeps you biting your nails i cannot believe the reviewers who disliked it ever actually saw it it is an undiscovered classic
this movie is inspiring to anyone who is or has been in a tough jam whether financially or emotionally you will definitely laugh which is the best medicine left in a bad financial situation when her husband dies grace has to find a new way to make some money and not exactly legal which adds to the humour even my boyfriend liked it so don't think that a chick-flic
i remember seeing this film years ago on i think i would very much like to view it again does anyone know how i can obtain a copy as i remember it was an especially powerful movie in particular the scene that stands out is of the horses wearing gas masks apart from that i really can't recall too much about the story which is why i want to view it again i have trawled the web but am unable to find a copy which is unusual in my experience perhaps there is no dvd or vhs of this film on the market would appreciate any help anyone can give me on this thanks very much in advance for your assistance best regards
this reminded me of spinal tap on a more serious level the story of a band doing a reunion tour but things are not harmonious between them i was especially impressed with the performance of bill nighy as ray you felt sorry for him yet he had a certain creepiness about him a great movie to watch if you have ever seen your favorite band get and highly recommended
i really enjoyed the not being of that generation waiting for the it was interesting to see a unique four hour capsule for that major problem in the movie however was how unbalanced the film was in the portrayal of the families according to promos i saw for the movie on nbc the story was basically about two families struggling with issues in america now i may have missed something but i think we learned more about the white family than the african american really think that the uses music to describe the scenes better than any dialogue that could come out of the mouths of the actors of which are very talented this is very visible at the end of the first part two hours in of the good movie
fragglerock is excellent in the way that list was excellent a great watch for children and adults of all genders big noses can be seen as hinting towards phallic symbols in the same way that puff n stuff had hinted towards marijuana smoking your kids will love this movie i enjoyed it very much as a child my father showed me this movie as a child he enjoyed it as well and pointed out that the exaggerated noses were phallic symbols although at the time i had no clue about what those were the movie is comedy and adventure the storyline is wacky and cheerful i and you shall enjoy this together
i get teased all the time by family and friends for my tears over movies and they were not disappointed when i watched this one i cried numerous times but believe me it was not over sappiness i ached for the family and i ached for this man as he tried to redeem himself the only way he knew how denzel was fabulous as always and so was chris walkin mickey rourke i did not even recognized though the years have not been kind to him my husband is not one to re-watch movies unless they are historically accurate war he has watched this movie times now and i am going to have to get the dvd to watch it again because he has worn out the tape and it jumped the whole time i was watching
this is a excellent series you will laugh you will cry these wonderful people will be a part of your family the way this family cares for one another and helps each other through their crisis sets a great example of the way we should live our lives there are many good things they do and a number of bad choices but they never turn their backs on family they work through problems michelle the youngest daughter is the cutest thing i've seen stephanie the middle daughter suffers with middle child syndrome and with the help of everyone in the family better dj the oldest daughter is growing up whether her dad wants it to happen or not one thing they all share is they miss their mom danny joey and uncle jesse love these kids so much and apparent in every episode
the cast is excellent the acting good the plot interesting the evolvement full of it is hard to cram all those elements into a film that is barely minutes long if more time was taken to develop the plot and subplots it would have a much better effect another minutes of substance would have made this a very good film rather then just a good one
in my opinion this is an absolutely romantic disney masterpiece if you ask me the stepmother of lucille la verne was truly diabolical you'll have to see the movie if you want to know why on the other hand despite the fact that she did a lot of housekeeping cinderella of ilene stanley was a very beautiful lady to me the scenery was beautiful the cast was well chosen and the writing was strong before i wrap this up i'd like to say that everyone involved in this film did very well now in conclusion i highly recommend this absolutely romantic disney masterpiece to all of you who haven't seen it you're in for a good time so go to the video store rent it or buy it kick back with a friend and watch it
this movie changed it all for heard of breakdancing and hiphop but had never seen it professionally done i was an old kid from holland when i saw this movie this all changed i got actively involved in the hiphop-movement in our city started breakdancing and writing this day i still consider this movie to be a personal favorite sure the filming and cinematographic importance might not be that significant but who cares if the wide-shot was filmed badly or if you could see a mic hanging above somebody what it does to you personally that counts
funny sexy hot there is no real plot but you needn't the naked or almost naked girls and the typical fights between college-cliques need no in all the whole seems to be known from simply every film in this category but the reissuer reached the goal that this film can be recognized out of thousand thing i've got to say unbelievable got to see it if you are young and you want know more about the female body you've got to see it twice
i would just like to say that no matter how low budget the film is it needs to be shown throughout this world the point to these movies we don't read that much anymore instead people want to see movies having this series out on dvd has made me want to read the whole series and want more please make all movies please don't change any of the characters either it ruins the effect because i have grown to love the actors who have played the characters please make all movies i want to see the message and watch the message that these books and now movies are here to portray we don't get that enough anymore awesome job
to me there is something so appealing and nostalgic about low-budget sci-fi as a kid in the thats all there was in i saw the first man into space in a movie theater with my dad it had marshall thompson starring and some other poor slob who got the title role it is also about a space mission gone bad where the astronaut turns into a grizzly killer scared the good plenty right out of me the memory of those heebie-jeebies still lives within me the incredible melting man is almost a re-make only in full glorious is wherever the scenes were well-lit just gotta love it for what it little over an hour of darkly lit scenes disgusting noises and that eerie music bravo
how to lose friends and alienate people is an entertaining if loose adaptation of toby memoir of the same name also a great title for helping to fill up the line requirement in imdb reviews the basic gist is the same as the book with certain incidents dramatised but a romantic plot is added and the ending is certainly hollywoodised simon pegg despite playing an essentially irritating person is his usual likable and funny self and pretty much carries the film strange to think only a few years ago he was just a tv sitcom guy and now rubbing shoulders with hollywood names a good supporting cast and an amusing easy watch kind of a male ugly betty but funnier
i have always been a huge fan of homicide life on the street so when i heard there was a reunion movie coming up i couldn't me just say i was not disappointed at all it was one of the most powerful hours of television i've ever seen it was great to see everyone back again but the biggest pleasure of all was to have andre braugher back because the relationship between pembleton and bayliss was always the strongest part of an all-together great show
i just watched this movie and have to say i was very impressed very creepy and has numerous moments that will make you jump out of seat i had to smoke several emergency cigarettes along the way to calm my nerves if i had to criticise i'd say that perhaps if anything there were too many jump moments it got to the point where every single new scene climaxed with a jump and this gradually wore away the startling effect because you kind of new what was it contains virtually every cliché in the ghost genre they were all done so well that it maintained the creepy fear-factor it had elements of the shining the sense and the changeling particular the soundtrack reminded me of the would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good old-fashioned scare
as dr alan feinstone corbin bernsen turns a marvelously deranged performance in the his already obsessive compulsive tendencies in high gear the irs hounding him and a very suspicious acting wife dr alan feinstone is losing his sanity more and more each the doc indeed does realize that his wife is having an affair with the local pool boy it sets off a string of events that lead to torture murder ant total mayhem the dentist is a solid film bernsen makes the character of dr feinstone relatable and hateable at the same time even though he is completely out of his gourd the audience will still feel sympathy towards him that my damn good nice solid cast of supporting actors round out this gem of a film excellent direction good killings and gore and effective pacing will keep you entertained throughout the movies recommended
the luzhin defence is in the foreground a story of an idiosyncratic chess savant who becomes consumed by the game and in the background via flashbacks his boyhood life and the forces which created the man he has become factor in good and evil in the forms of his his love interest and former mentor respectively and you have a plaintive drama laced with poignant and delicately humorous moments mingled with the rich scenic beauty of lake como and the intensity of high chess play an excellent film for those into period dramas the euphemistic chess play metaphor for orgasmic delight is an indication of the subtle wit behind the film
this is indeed a funny show done in a creepy sort of way much like a tim burton film worth a look as far more creative than most of the shows this season best of all not a reality show i'm wondering why the viewing public is so ready to accept shows like that lack creativity and ignore wonderful shows like this that actually have a creative some decry the premise i think really unusual much more enjoyable than ghost whisperer and medium i think the funniest thing on the tube since my name is and the narration and music are wonderful if you enjoy shows that are a bit off the beaten path i'd recommend it not as strange as twin peaks was but got a serious kink to it
after reading the comments to this movie and seeing the mixed reviews i decided that i would add my ten cents worth to say i thought the film was excellent not only in the visual beauty the writing music score acting and directing but in putting across the story of joseph smith and the road he traveled through life of hardship and persecution for believing in god the way he felt and knew to be his path i am very pleased indeed to have had a small part in telling the story of this remarkable man i recommend everyone to see this when the opportunity presents itself no matter what religious path he or she may be walking this only instills one with more determination to live the life that we should with true values of love and forgiveness as the savior taught us to do
me and my sister rented this movie because we were in the mood for something trashy and not so demanding to watch however the movie greatly exceeded my very low is so much more than just a representation of a century it has very real portrayals of the characters within it and most of the actors do an amazing job the different stories are baked together with actual footage from the time that gives it a very unique touch while watching it i really felt that i cared about what happened to the would also like to give endless amounts of praise to julia stiles in her portrayal of katie she was great in a way that stood would recommend this movie to anyone
don't look for an overdeveloped plotline sit back with some popcorn and enjoy this one a gallery of stars pop up as the classic cartoon villains in this live action comedy which features incredible makeup and set design not to mention knockout performances from beatty madonna and pacino great fun for kids and adults out of
jeremy brett is simply the best holmes ever narrowly edging out the great basil rathbone of course and this is probably the best adaptation of a conon-doyle short length adaptation includes some new plot strands that fit in well to the surrounding drama and heightens the hatred one feels for performances all round especially from robert hardy and both brett and hardwick fully rounded and comfortable in their roles makes this a superb piece of drama
for a long time it seemed like all the good canadian actors had headed south of the border and guessed all the second rank ones filled the top slots and that left the dregs for the sex film was a real surprise despite the outlandish plots that are typical of farces the actors seemed to be trying to put something into their characters and what we the viewer got back was almost true suspension of belief when the extras from the music video attacked the evicting police you almost believed it was you are a fan of some of the better sex farces or not you should definitely seek this one out and the big surprise this sex farce is also loaded with some very good nudity
this is widely viewed in australia as one of the best cop dramas ever produced here and for my money anywhere raw gritty the characters are real the situations are believable and it doesn't shy away from the darker side of life confronted every day by cops and the criminals victims lawyers and other people in their various show ran for seasons and was discontinued because the show didn't sell well overseas we are all sorry for its loss however like fawlty towers we will be able to revere this as a limited-length series of uniformly high quality
i rate this out of it offers insight into something i barely understand the surfers surf because all they want to do nothing else seems to matter as much to them as surfing nor is it a temporary thing a lifetime for these guys buried in the movie is a great history of surfing i have never surfed but i love surfing movies and have seen many none taught me what this movie did the movie was very well edited it flowed well the interviews were outstanding interesting from start to summary about as good as a documentary as i have seen so i have to rate in terms of that so
i loved this film seen this evening on a movie theatre big screen the audience laughed out loud at some very interesting things and the fast pace was most do as a singer and musical director question one section of roby vocal in by a waterfall the key modulated and she was suddenly singing much lower in a very mellow voice that bore no resemblance to the somewhat tin-like higher twitter voice she used in all her other anyone know if this was overdubbed by another singer it sounds it to me i would love to so much
i disagree with anyone who done't like this movie used to love this movie when i was little and i still do sweet funny and warms your heart and it proves that love and friendship can never be destroyed even though it didn't have much of a story it was still excellent i give it a and two thumbs up yeah and it proves that your deepest and dreams can come true love this movie personally if anyone says it sucked than i will say shame on you because it was a delightful little movie and i'm glad that at least some people liked it
this is a great documentary film any fan of car racing should own a copy of this outstanding film director stephen low did a great well as the main stars of the film father son mario michael andretti the dvd looks sounds amazing and best of all imax great home theater test disc
as so many others have written this is a wonderful documentary here is a list of the chapters for anyone interested a new germany distant war september france falls may-june alone may barbarossa june-december banzai japan on our way usa desert north africa stalingrad june wolfpack red star the soviet union whirlwind bombing germany september tough old gut its a lovely day tomorrow burma home fires britain inside the reich germany morning june august occupation holland pincers august march genocide nemesis germany february-may japan pacific february the bomb february-september reckoning
the movie gets to the guts of the tension between a son and a brilliant dialog lovely scenery and great acting serve as an excellent way to present the onion that keeps peeling back core issues of parenting communication and manhood are explored fun ways the curtain is pulled back the masks slip off a little and truths are of this happens amidst a road trip format the backdrop is rural new york state in the early fall just as the trees are changing colors wow
i really wonder how this show plays in the and the rest of europe it is so self-loathing about being an white americans that could be a big reason for some of the venom and vitriol expressed here on this board i love the show but it is with some reservations and i feel it took the easy way out by spoiler and burning everything at the end of the second season julie slammed the door shut on any hope of reviving the show unless her character lands on a haystack in the middle of some farm who knows it was a funny raunchy and on occasion kinda scary show
spoiler had just watched the extended version of bedknobs and broomsticks though i did like the extended version i wish they would have left the original version on the portabello road could have been cut down to the orginal length it was too long and dragged the movie along though the dancing is great would have been much better left on the dvd as a deleted in all this is a great movie my year old liked it and it is wonderful that movies that i enjoyed as a child are being passed on to a new generation this and mary poppins are added to my as i had out of
i just watched this movie on showtime quite by accident actually if i wouldn't have only had hrs of sleep for the past two days then i wouldn't have came home early from work if i hadn't came home early from work i wouldn't have seen this movie i wouldn't have known what i was missing but i would've missed a the way this movie is almost playing on the kevin bacon effect that and causality my verbiage above ever character is intertwined in some way or another action reaction interaction non-interaction this movie is just wonderful i'm going to have to find a copy to buy
standard rise to fame tale that has a few high points number one lonette mckee as sister who gives a stunning star making performance the fact that she never became a huge sensation after this is beyond me sadly she is a supporting character and we are forced to focus on irena bland character sparkle whose rise to fame is easy boring and unconvincing however whenever the girls go on stage and perform the movie comes back to life the original music by curis mayfield must be praised the copy i saw was a very old vhs tape the picture quality was pretty low as well as the production values i'm guessing all in all its worth a gander
virgil manoven is an old man who lives alone in his remote rural his beloved cat one morning into the woods around his glimpses what looks like the murder of a young child in the middle of the reports the crime to the police but no body to be by disturbing investigates further and eventually is guided to a spooky orphanage where events take a supernatural turn soft for digging is a fantastic experimental horror with lots of creepy atmosphere to minimalist film is almost completely devoid of scenes are genuinely nightmarish and the acting is location sets provide plenty of eerie maryland woods rival those used in the blair witch this strange horror film a out of
glad that someone has made a movie about how hard it is to risk your heart for a second time or third this movie is exactly what it promises to be lovely amusing and it gives you this good feeling around your heart when it ends the plot might be not very inventive but there are millions of ways to tell the story and they have not been all used yet the cast is perfectly selected although scott wolf does not look like a father of an eight year old not even when he is wearing a suit so the sparks are on all the right places supporting cast is lovably supporting and although you could probably predict the whole movie you would not want to switch the channel it is just the right sort of entertainment for a sunday evening
i have to agree with mr caruso jr was the finest voice god had to offer if only he could have found the courage to go for broke leave hollywood and head for the opera he could have been the american caruso everyone says he could have been but in any case he is a fantastic introduction to the art form no bones about it and if thats the way its gonna be so be it see the film you'll see why mr lanza still come up in discussion even in my house someone says pavarotti i say mario for the film itself when will it be on dvd they must have it restored and vhs isn't good enough but this should also be the only lanza film put on dvd the others are down right bad and boring
another one of those films you hear about from friends read about on imdb not many false notes in this one i could see just about everything here actually happening to a young girl fleeing from a dead-end home town in tennessee to florida with all her worldly possessions in an old beaten-up heroine ruby makes some false starts but learns from them i found myself wondering why why didn't she lean a bit more on shoulder has her reasons as it turns a fine film the only thing i don't much like about it i think is the title
brilliant adaptation of the largely interior monologues of leopold bloom stephen dedalus and molly bloom by joseph strick in recreating the endearing portrait of dublin on june bloomsday a day to be celebrated double entendre intended bravo director strick screenwriter haines as well as casting director and cinematographer in creating this masterpiece gunter grass novel the tin drum filmed by volker schlöndorff another fine film adaptation of interior monologue which i favorably compare with there are clearly recognized dublin landmarks in the original novel and in the film there are also recognizable characters although with different names in the novel for example buck mulligan with whom dedalus lives turns out to be a then prominent dublin surgeon film for all of its excellence is made even richer by additional viewings june
i love all of the movies by michael landon jr and michael landon casting of dale midkiff as clark not of been any better dale midkiff has the ways to pull off this movie kept me spellbound from start to death of missie willies baby girl with the timing of clarks visit was only gods timing how they dealt with the death and how clark helped them do so was that of a fathers there are movies before this one love comes softly loves enduring promise loves long journey i feel you can see this movie and understand it easily yet leave and want to see the previous movies due to the history all the characters have behind landon jr is an excellent look forward to many more movies from him in the future
i've loved this movie ever since it first came out i was about nine years old and now i'm i remember playing the video game on sega genisis i had so much fun i would love to show my son this movie he likes michael jackson as well and i know he will love this movie just as i did when i was a kid even though much younger than i was when i first saw it i can't wait for it to come out on dvd i hope it comes out on dvd please let it come out on dvd i'm dying to see it again well that is my comment i hope that one day soon i'll get to view this movie again i love all of the videos in this movie my favorite mini-video is badder
cinderella is a beautiful film with beautiful songs of course in fact one of the best films of the think all the characters are portrayed amazingly you can see the cruelness of stepsisters and her stepmother the sweetness of cinderella the mice are funny and sweet think they changed the tale a bit but i think for the best such a nice film and i don't think anyone could resist it deep give it a i don't think the best disney film but it sure is a true classic
firstly let me say that i didn't like the fact that the rock won the title that is so gay next i feel regal should have got back his european title jeff hardy is a crappy champ rob van dam had the intercontinental title too long already brock should have won it i am pleased with storm and christian being tag champs best match was the booker t and big show match in my opinion
blonde and blonder has pamela anderson and denise richards in almost every scene and if you want more from a movie you're being utterly unreasonable it feels like a late era carry on when the series was no longer blazing trails but was still more funny than not think behind or england and you won't be too far off the mark pamela and denise are bubbly charming and clearly aware this isn't a masterpiece they're making although you can give me it over lots of things i'm told to like the supporting cast are energetic even if some of them aren't particularly good i can't see a couple of duff turns in a movie already practically forgotten making much difference to anything so just smile i really do think blonde and blonder is ace and i hope you hate me for it
this film has been scaring me since the first day i saw mum had watched it when it was on the telly back in i remember being woken up in the middle of the night by her tearful ramblings as my dad helped her up the was saying something like don't let her get me or something like that i asked what had made her so upset and she told me that she'd been watching the woman in obviously i had to watch it and even though i was only eleven she let me it scared the out of me i've been immune to horror films since watching this
dressed to kill has been more or less forgotten in critical circles in the past years but it is a true american classic a film which is much more than just a glossy sincerely hope the dvd release will give more people the chance to hear about it and see it
one can only hope that there are many times when someone as powerful as morgan freeman can take the time to assist someone who needs all comes down to loving people as will rogers said i never met a man i didn't like of course if you meet paz vega not to like that smile of hers can melt diamonds she is just so fantastic that i can watch anything she is in the same goes for freeman he is just magic on the two of them gave us a film that was funny from start to finish from the mexican supermarket to lorraine bobby to packy it was tender charming and just plain have to check this out
my super x-girlfriend is one hell of a roller coaster ride the special effects were excellent and the costumes uma thurman wore were hubba buba uma thurman is an underrated comedic actress but she proved everyone wrong and nailed her role as the lunatic girlfriend she was just simply fabulous luke wilson was also good as the average joe but he was a brave man to work with one of the greatest actresses of all time the supporting cast was also superb especially anna faris who was extremely good lot better than in the scary movie rietman did very well in directing this film because if it wasn't for him and uma thurman this film wouldn't have done so well this film is clearly a for cast thurman director screenplay and from original plot line this film is very highly recommended
the wooden horse is a very clever movie about a very clever and successful escape plan worked out by british during world war ii it is superbly acted with a wry sense of humor especially the lines expressed by the acid-tongues leo genn anthony steele and david tomlinson george banks in mary poppins are marvelous as the two heroes the direction is taut and fast-moving throughout highly recommended
for all the homicide junkies out there this movie was great every single character that ever was on the show made an appearance in the movie it helped to resolve some not all issues from the series unfortunately unless you actually did watch the series most of the enjoyment would be lost as the movie made heavy references to every season of the existence this probably would have been appropriate as a series finale as opposed to being a separate movie but we gotta take what we can get i hope they make more movies and continue to feature homicide characters on law and order
six degrees had me hooked i looked forward to it coming on and was totally disappointed when men in trees replaced time spot i thought it was just on hiatus and would be back early in what happened all my friends were really surprised it ended we could relate to the characters who had real problems we talked about each episode and had our favorite characters there wasn't anybody on the show i didn't like and felt the acting was superb i alway like seeing programs being taped in cities where you can identify the local areas i for one would like to protest the canceling of this show and ask you to bring it back and give it another chance give it a good time slot don't keep moving it from this day to that day and advertise it so people will know it is on
this is part one of a short animation clip showing the history of the matrix the war between man and machine that resulted in the eventual creation of the matrix the animation is part japanese anime part contemporary american animation and is very well made considering the excellent directors behind the movie it shows the initial development of ai and the exploitation of the machines by man until the day they rebelled
i thought it was an original story very nicely told i think all you people are expecting too much i just a made for television movie what are you expecting some great wonderful dramtic piece i thought it was a really great story for a made for television my opinion
everything i remember about it was excellent great cast with sam waterston george innes he became more familiar to us audiences excellent scripts as only the english can do edwardian sherlock peter campion type mysteries but with a jules verne twist sort of like macgyver would have been had it been in england years earlier right at the beginning of the revolution of the often wondered if the creators of macgyver saw these shows macgyver first aired about years still have episode on a much deteriorated tape
i recently watched the version of this film with judy and while i appreciated the story and music i found that the film failed to hold my attention i expected the remake to be the same story except with a barbra twist i was pleasantly surprised it was a much more realistic and modern look at fame money love and the price of it all this version is so much more real than the one with arguably better music better acting a more gripping plot line and of course a deeper love i do not understand why the previous film is on the american film top list while this gripping remake fails to make a mark on any list
the movie is truly poignant unique and uplifting the story is universal in that a battle between good evil and the world between the most important thing is that its rating is wrong misleading and a travesty blockbuster has it rated as though it were an x rated movie the truth is is that it is closer to g than pg and should be seen by children who can read the clear and simple sub-titles
i lived in tokyo for months knowing the reality of long train commutes bike rides from the train station soup stands and other typical scenes depicted so well certainly added to my own appreciation for this film which i really really liked there are aspects of japanese life in this film painted with vivid colors but you don't have to speak japanese to enjoy this movie director tricks were subtle for the most part i found his highlighting the character called tamako tamura with a soft filter making her sublime a tiny bit contrived but most of the directors tricks were so gentle that i was fully pulled in and just danced with his characters or cried or laughed aloud wonderful
the lion king is a very cute story to go along with the lion king it basically follows the original story of the lion king but with a couple of twists in the vents are explained by a different characters point of view this story is still an original far as sequels go disney isn't all that great at making worthwhile ones this one being the third part to the lion king pride is the second actually has an original idea to it while still involving the fun of the first timon and pumbaa travel along looking for the ideal place to live after searching far and wide they find the place of hakuna matata they then meet a small lion named simba and go through many things that parents today go think this is a very good movie and i'm happy to add it to my collection
i recently got the chance to view the waterdance and quite liked it i don't really understand why its called that as there isn't really any dancing going on there except maybe for the dancing at the strip club near the end we are introduced to the main characters throughout the movie invalids in a hospital the story shows a love affair between a physically sisabled guy and a healthy woman which is a very sweet you don't get to see movies like that today im not stuck in a time warp im not saying that everything during the and early was better than today but i really think the movie industry is deteriorating and much we can learn from old movies-by old movies i mean anything from
a great film the acting from the doctor to the pavement artist to the head prostitute with very few exceptions was wonderful i thought soni and vrajesh were the best of the lesser known actors even kurush deboo who might be accused of overacting presented quite a believable and familiar great thing was the camera work and the way it captured the energy of bombay streets the tranquility of gustad saying his prayers and life within the tiny liked the story of the wall that becomes a shrine and then gets broken down and the artists philosophical take on great to see good movies on indian themes
quick and simple i love this some others have mentioned i also am not from the south don't really care for country music and have never worn a cowboy hat never drove around in a car with a dead body in my trunk either but i love goodfellas this is just great film making shot in a aspect ratio and beautifully transfered to dvd vhs was full screen and yes a solid mix for your viewing pleasure what can you say about this just a great story set in texas with great performances travolta is fantastic next to pulp fiction the best thing done been in my top for this one out a
i have to say that sometimes looks are all that matters just like jeremy clarkson from bbc has pointed out about our earth though but he is right when it comes to looks this movie is such an unbelievably stunning beauty you will absolutely love what your eyes are about to then the personality of the movie as well interesting with a captivating narrator voice and narrator stories that will touch your soul as you watch those superbly filmed movie probably won't affect your lifestyle ruining these beauties but it will certainly remember you how precious our earth we live on truly movie deserves stars as it is one of the few stylistic earth documentaries i truly enjoyed
as a former time okinawan karate world champion i like movies about sacrifice for sport but this movie is about so much more this movie is so good and so deep i have recently been plagued by very serious injury and pretty much a disastrous lack of passion almost lights out for me and this silly little movie touched me so deep that like out of a daze it reminded me about what life is supposed to be about this is a movie about living living your life for yourself and respect for others empowerment god bless bend it like beckham i believe it is a true gem
ah i loved this movie i think it had it all it made me laugh out loud over a dozen of times yes i am a girl so i'm writing this from a perspective i think a shame it only scored in rating too many guys voting it was far above other romantic comedies just because i'm female i don't enjoy all chic flicks on the contrary i prefer other genres romantic comedies tend to be shallow and not as funny as they meant to be but like i said this movie had it all almost in my opinion great script good one-liners fine acting although eva longoria character reminded very much of gabrielle from desperate housewives but so what it was awesome i will keep this film for rainy days days when i feel low and need a few laughs
fabulous actors beautiful scenery stark reality i won't elaborate on all of the other reviewers comments because you get the picture however the movie isn't for the squeamish reality is slaughtering pigs and other livestock in order to survive i also have elinore randall homestead book i read it several years ago i have to reread it since i just watched the newly-released remastered dvd of the tried to buy the video for several years finally bought it used from a video store that went out of business but yippee the dvd is now for sale i purchased it on not cheap but well worth it to me this is a movie i will be watching until the end of my days
let me state at the outset that i have cerebral palsy and i went into this film expecting to have to make allowances for the lead performance i left the theater half-convinced that they'd cast an actor who had cerebral palsy in the role even though i knew that was not the case the performances were generally excellent with a special nod to brenda fricker and to hugh o'conner believe his name as the young christy brown christy is talented brash arrogant at times vulgar and petulant-in other words human this film along with gaby a true story and the documentary king gimp are excellent portrayals of life with cp by no means a complete portrait but fine examples of the disabled as human beings most highly recommended
ruth gordon is one of the more sympathetic killers that columbo has ever had to deal with and the plot is ingenious all the way around this is one of the best columbo episodes ever mariette hartley and g d spradlin are excellent in their supporting roles and peter falk delivers a little something extra in his scenes with gordon
i like this film a lot it has a wonderful chemistry between the actors and tells a story that is pretty universal the story of the prodigal son the aspect i like the best however was the way that the bath house was more than just a background for the story as the father told the son the story of his family in the northern deserts of china the element of water and bathing becomes an almost sacred ritual water was so scarce that a simple bath had profound depth and the film was very effective there were moments however when it verged on too on cloying during the park recital scene but overall i highly recommend this film
i went to see it times this movie a friend of mine went to see it at the release party and he was telling me it was so great that i was expecting very much about the movie to mutch i couldn't enjoy it because i was not watching it in nuteral position the second time i knew what to expect and i enjoyed it more than the first time after the second time i felt so in the mood to have a party i loved the music just tom barman improves his directing talent he will be a director where everyone will be talking about if you can delivere this movie as your first you must be acting is done by some great belgian stars roofthooft and a bunch of upcomming talents like titus de
good movie very you can not expect much from a film like this sirpa lane is an actress of erotic films a nice body but nothing exceptional savant to a pornographic actress from the body disappears but the were characterized a small breasts and a simple eroticism not demand a lot from these films are light years away from the movies today the world has changed incredibly the plot is simple and the actors not extraordinary and the brunette actress has a single body has one breast slightly bigger be satisfied papaya also is not great but at least these films have a certain charm download them again but then again who knows what you pretend not to them
i remember this show as it became a regular viewing on a saturday is a young girl who moves in with her aunts who as it turns out are witches and she is one to so sabrina must learn how to control hr powers and use them effectively she also must deal with school a vicious rival named libby her ditsy best friend and boyfriend harvey show was funny and entertaining it kept saturday evenings entertaining for a year old made him laugh out flirt with libby
the world is a terrible place but this movie is farce and fun and if you don't like it you don't get it and if you don't get it doesn't matter up to you if you want to play along every actor in this one had fun only a joke and good enough for me gabriel byrne is priceless byrne and paul anka doing my way is as vic puts it the best version ever okay no masterpiece but not bad i was warned against seeing it but i'm sure glad i did
this version of bleak house is the best adaptation of a classic novel known to me the representation of the court of chancery as a character in the drama is magnificent the acting is marvellous from the sinister tulkinghorn to the dedlocks smallweed crooke miss flyte and the two young lovers but it is the web of chancery that holds the whole thing together and the cinematography is superb what mistake did the bbc make about copyright that meant that this version could not be seen in the uk on either video or dvd for many years i tried to find out from them but faced a stone wall in the end i got a dvd copy from canada
similar to on the town this musical about sailors on shore leave falls short of the later classic in terms of pacing and the quality of the songs but it has its own charms kelly has three fabulous dance routines one with jerry the cartoon mouse of tom and jerry fame one with a little girl and a fantasy sequence where he is a spanish lover determined to reach his lady on a high balcony sinatra playing shy inexperienced buddy and grayson the woman who serves as the love interest for both men do most of the singing iturbi provides some fine piano playing at nearly two and half hours it is a bit too long for a light musical but it doesn't drag
first of all for this movie i just have one word wow this is probably one of the best movies that touched me from story to performances so wonderfully played by sophia loren and marcello mastroianni i was very impressed with this last one because he really brought depth to the character as it was a very hard role still the two of them formed a pair that surprised me from the beginning until the end showing in the way a friendship filled with love that develops during the entire day settled in the movie the story takes some time to roll as the introduction of the characters is long but finally we are compensated with a wonderful tale about love and humanity if you have the chance see it because a movie that will stay in your mind for many time simply amazing
this is one of the best movie i have ever seen my parents comes from rural india and to some extend i have seen the life of the villagers peoples are really poor and have financial and social problems movie just reflects exactly the same full credit to the director and the actor they have done an excellent job i just wonder how can movies like lagaan and paheli can go for oscar and not doghi i don't understand the criteria on which the movies are selected is the money that makes the difference or having some big names in the movie makes the to see more movies like this in the future
actor herman josé plays the role of a football of a soccer entrepreneur that acquires the pass of two african players and tries to sell them for very little money to the rival club of the benfica of its porto therefore these players did not play well and it wanted that the fc port was wronged with this but what happens is that these two players after all are good and fc porto sell them for much money to a foreign club making a good business the film for a small country as portugal without great antecedents in great films is a very good and funny comedy showing all the rivalry that exists between of portugal highly recommended
i am glad other people enjoyed this movie cause i know it doesn't have the greatest reputation and it made no money at the box office i thought it was terrific and there are several reasons why bogdanovich directs with the lightest of touches the cast coleen camp is perfect and the big bad apple never looked better on film you've seen worse movies
kurt russell is at his best as the man who lives off his past glories reno hightower robin williams is his polar opposite in a rare low key performance as jack dundee he dropped the big pass in more ways than see some of the most quotable scenes ever put into one film as jack hisses at a rat reno poses and the call of the caribou goes miss this classic that isn't scared to show football in the mud the way it should be played to the nfl
i saw the long dying when it first came out at the cinema i thought the film gave a good soldiers point of view it gave a realistic account of men at war the storyline moves at a nice pace showing a group of men behind enemy lines and trying to return back to their own lines with an enemy prisoner the characters are well developed and hemmings is a good actor and plays the leading role with conviction as does alan dobie german helmut i was surprised that i have been unable to find this film on vhs or dvd and i feel it has become the forgotten film which is sad as it is superior to many other war films i have seen
this game is amazing really you should get it if you don't have it although it is ancient now it was amazing when it came out i believe that this game will always be a classic just as good a super mario world or so when i was young my friend and i would sit and play this game for hours trying to beat it which we eventually did not nearly as advanced as super mario galaxy but if you are a fellow mario fan it is essential fun entertaining and challenging everything you could want out of a fantasy game except for good graphics it did come out in rock on mario luigi and yoshi nintendo is the best
the filmmaker inhaled andy art his search for closeness with the land and the water and his sense of proportion and so gently so beautifully breathed it back on to film for the rest of us rivers and tides loves work and joins it as a visual concert of time and human presence in a flowing world a world that hides its power in plain sight see this movie
dick tracy wasn't the best for many comic book fans because they wanted something with blood like batman dick tracy plays the innocence of just being a comic book with villains that have severe appearance disorder and being fun warren beatty directs and stars as the main character that fights crime without even using super powers i have liked dick tracy since i was a child because of the comic atmosphere of the main colors red blue orange yellow green and black this is the perfect film for anybody to watch with their children al pacino is like the jack nicholson in batman and plays big boy caprice with zest madonna as the babe who is the second villain in this film doesn't play the same boy toy she represents like i said no blood obscenities sexually innuendo or anything to offend anybody
john waters has made the most effusively buoyant heartfelt dark personal little film i think i've ever seen maybe fast food fast women comes in close second the directors vision is narrative is whimsical the characters are personal and odd reflections of family and his own inner life the tone never forced or stylistically is no pretentious shot design ennui or magazine plimpton is amazing as the furlong is inspired casting a grandmother with a talking mary tea-bagging recycled clothing garbage becomes art and the lesson of the film is that the most important thing we can value is family and a humble life
okay this film probably deserves out of stars but i've voted for to help offset the misleading rating from the handful of who gave this film zero or star reviews each of the segments for this anthology shows great potential and promise for the talented filmmakers three of whom have gone on to achieve notable success in big-time hollywood productions performances range from rough all the way up to completely impressive with notable turns by bill paxton james karen vivian schilling and brion james martin kove may be a big melodramatic as the psychotic hypnotist with the bizarro strobe-lamp and lance august seems intentionally dimwitted as an unsuspecting lab victim but overall got some great laughs and some genuinely scary moments definitely worth seeing so judge for yourself
i wait for each new episode each re-run with anticipation the new look of sci-fi created by stargate is a wonder that i hope will never end to combine the past with the future is a new twist that is fascinating to me season should be a thrill in itself i wish that richard dean anderson would show up more often in the new season as i love his dry wit as much as his temper tantrums in his character as jack o'neill the other characters add their own uniqueness to the show that makes it a winner season after season you cancel this program in the next three years and you make a serious mistake also you need a bigger role for the asgard they are just too cool
years ago many big studios promoted serial films that were shown in movie in between the actual features along with a newsreel of current events plus cartoons especially on a saturday afternoon parents loved it mostly the return of chandu was a episode serial where mysterious mr is a magician with super natural powers and travels to the island of lemuria to rescue the kidnapped princess of house of princess nadji is held captive by the black magic cult of ubasti who believe that she is a reincarnation of their long-dead goddess ossana these serials take you way back in time and are very well produced considering we are talking about
i've spent years looking for a copy of this so i could show it to my kids the movie is funny and spike and the members of his band show why they were the best musicians in the business they had to be that good to play that demented i like it and recommend it for movie lovers of all movie is about a turn of the century firehouse with a crew of misfits that are firemen and the department band not fighting the fires the usual running gags plus the mayhem of spike jones and his orchestra also comedy relief provided by comedian buddy hackett and straight-man hugh o'brien
i first saw this film in in the midday movie spot after many subsequent viewings purchase of the video it still makes me laugh out a relic of another age a domestic comedy set in affluent middle class america but well executed is well executed but also a document of its age a celebration of post-war optimism the baby boom and the nascent consumer age this film is no guilty wonderful sophisticated leads actors urbane melvyn douglas bemused cary grant daffily determined myrna loy complement each other and a memorable team of favourite scenes it means we gotta blast and miss stellwaggen and this little it
saw this film in august at the annual national association of black journalists convention in milwaukee wi first public screening the film is great derek luke is wonderful as antwone fisher this young actor has a very bright future the real antwone fisher did a great job writing the film and direction is right on the money see it opening weekend you won't be disappointed
one of the best movies out there yeah maybe the cinematography wasn't the greatest but an excellent plot and concept great for the time and brilliant and creative ideas something different from the usual movies and great fun one of my favorites and would recommend to anyone who likes creative and imaginative movies post world war and fighting in gigantic robots the actors gave a great performance and made it all worth while the sets are not amazing but simple and worked for the overall look of the film this movie is very hard to find on dvd but also on vhs check it out cause i have loved it since it came out not a mainstream flick and not like anything you've ever seen take a look and think like a child a great view and very fun
riding giants is an amazing movie it really shows how these people lived back then just to surf their lives were basically surfing living breathing and having fun they didn't care about money jobs girls or any thing to them the waves were their girls i have never been on a surf board and it looks so hard i don't understand how they can stay on them it makes no sense at all this is an awesome movie and if you love surfing then you should really see this movie if you're a surfer and you want to find out who started surfing how it came into life who is really famous at it or what ever then you should really see it it might be a documentary but it is really good
the luzhin defence is a movie worthy of time it is a brooding intense film and kept my attention the entire time john turturro is absolutely stunning in his portrayal of a tender eccentric chess grandmaster and emily watson is spell-binding as the gentle but rebellious daughter of a highly respected russian family the chemistry between watson and turturro on screen is obvious from the moment their characters meet in the story all in all this movie is one of the best in-depth looks at the life of a chess grandmaster and turturro and watson add a whole non-mainstream non-cliche feel to the film most people will come out of the theater thinking and feeling somewhat touched by this brilliant look at the most unlikely of love stories
a very good wartime movie showing the effects of war on a hometown boy who looses his eyesight on guadalcanal and must come home and re-adjust himself with the help of family and friends an excellent cast of helps make this movie very entertaining eleanor role as the girlfriend was worthy of an oscar nomination she has such an innocence to her in this movie ann doran role was equally satisfying as was all of her small supporting roles i especially like the hometown aura of pre-war phildelphia the hunting scene is very good of course the war scene on guadalcanal truly showed the horror faced by our soldiers during this epic battle a well deserving film and one that should not be forgotten
fascinating downer about a would-be male hustler in new york city forced to live in a condemned building with a crippled con-man extremely bleak examination of modern-day moral and social decline extremely well-directed by john schlesinger never topped his work here and superbly acted by jon voight and dustin hoffman packs quite a punch overall yet the fantasy of which are played for a mildly intrusive as is the mod drug party the relationship that develops between the two men is sentimental yet the filmmakers are careful not to get mushy and this gives the picture an edge it might not have had with a lesser director than schlesinger originally x-rated in and the winner of the best picture oscar screenwriter waldo salt adapted james leo book and schlesinger also won statues from
now this is what i'm talking about finally a low-budget horror outing that uses its limitations to its advantage wendigo while occasionally flawed is a triumph of the imagination granted it leans heavy on evil dead style camera moves for its moodiness but still a damn sight better than of direct to video story is pretty simple a family takes a vacation at a remote cabin and are menaced by one particularly unhinged hunter but director larry fessenden really knows how to build suspense and add layers of unsettling creepiness through the use of the mythical wendigo is it real is it all in the imagination is it an externalization of the emotional state have quibbled that the film is unsatisfying because left to you to decide don't be put off by such petty nonsense a film that makes you think is not one to avoid one to rejoice in
in die nibelungen siegfried siegfried was betrayed now kriemhild seeks revenge she marries hagen and through a series of events finally engages in a very drastic fitting action at the of the things about watching this movie nowadays is that we can look at certain portrayals attila the hun etzel in the movie is shown as the strange person from the east possibly an allusion to the soviet union obviously it was not fritz fault that hitler used the nibelungenlied for german national pride in the third reich but one can see what the fuhrer liked about the story nonetheless this is an absolutely formidable movie
this is truly the greatest swedish movie of all time not only is it revolutionary in its narration but its also among the first movies to feature the next generation of swedish humor and swedish comedians felix herngren and fredrik lindström are two of the most intelligent and witty filmmakers in sweden today and this film really puts that on människor people is a warm-hearted and hilarious story about adulthood and the question if we be better off without it
jean-jacques career began with his essay answer to a prize question civilization makes us evil this intelligent and exciting movie supports that argument in that sense it repeats a theme common to french films society is real identity is a construction freedom is criminal here the idea is treated literally both main characters find themselves and each other only when breaking rules this discovery may well hold true in france at any rate quite romantic
anyone who does not find this movie funny does not understand simple comedy this movie is not a complex comedy it is full of one liners and sight gags and will make anyone who wants to laugh laugh the alien who is doing a nicholson impression will crack you up
it was only when i saw napoleon dynamite that i remembered seeing cracker bag just beautiful sentiment and yet never stooping to being soppy there is some terrific cinematography and the lead girl is quite brilliant it captures more than the nostalgia of the time it has a real heart to it it is the achilles wound of childhood that is exquisite and painful a simple story is always effective when done well this glendyn ivin has a big future and i for one am looking out for his next project the follow up is always the most difficut thing like the second album blues for most people just hope his next film is not something lame like a shark film cheers to all enjoy your cinema
spoilers just plot details i can't understand such hatred for this episode you want to watch a bad episode of smallville watch subterranean now a sack of crap tom welling gives a good performance don't say that very often and michael rosenbaum is great but he is most of the time the alternate universe scenario seems eerily realistic the martian manhunter who previously appeared in static returns and tells clark that the doctor that is the head of the insane asylum where they are being held at is actually a phantom from the phantom zone and if clark wants to return to his universe he must kill him an overall great episode with good acting and a decent pace
this movie is really good the plot which works like puzzle forces viewer to think and guess what will happen next such a trick brings a lot of surprises and makes a viewer really looking forward to solution of a riddle fighting scenes are very good a lot of different combat styles one of styles was a bit unreal for me but only my opinion to watch and fascinating show the only thing which may be irritating is actors look a bit too effeminate least for me hong kong was always good at kung-fu movies especially in the and so five venoms other its versions is great choice
although kurt russell was and is probably the closest person to look like elvis in show-business so many things were false in this film first of all the makers claimed elvis opened his famous live shows in after a year hault for films by wearing a white jump-suit made in also they claimed he sang burning love which he first sung in and the wonder of you which he first recorded in they also claim that he got his first guitar for christmas when all elvis fans know he got it for his birthday i know all movies based on past have something false but these things are so obvious to people who like elvis
a friend of mine recommended this movie citing my vocal and inflective similarities with des howl the main character i guess to an extent i can see that and perhaps a bit more i'm not very sure whether or not flattering is a pretty unique work the only movie to which this might have more than a glancing similarity would be true romance not for the content or the style of filming or for the pace of dialogue music is just so much more well relaxed but instead that they both represent modern love general i'm a big fan of canadian movies about music and musicians example i highly recommend hard core logo and this film in particular it has an innocent charm des is not always the most likeably guy but something about him that draws a sterling sort of empathy
wow i loved this movie it is about normal life in a small village about hypocrisy and honesty love and surrender great it is about things everybody encounters in life you have to do things with passion but some people will not appreciate your passion and will try to stop you there are people who find the opinion of others and what will the neighbors think more important than to follow their heart don't let opinion stop you from fulfilling your dreams and passion i loved the fact that the actors were all really normal people it could have been my family no big beauties but all people you fall in love with during the movie
a typical clausen film but then again not typical clausen writes directs and play one of the leading roles this is really a great film about normal people living normal lives trying to make the best of it the primary actors were helmut was convincing you believe that he really is richter plays a nurse that really is an actor but it turns out that she is the best nurse to take care of the old has problems and those who nobody believes in ends up being happy but nothing good comes easy they have to fight to win their life and love
unfortunately because of us viewers tendency to shun subtitles this movie has not received the distribution nor attention it merits its subtle themes of belonging identity racial relations and especially how colonialism harms all parties transcend the obvious dramatic tensions the nostalgic memories of the childhood and the exoticism of her relationship with her parents houseboy perhaps the only real human she knows we won't even look at her relationship with this elegant man there i hope i've given you enough of a hook to take it in whether you speak french or like subtitles or not i challenge you to be as brave strong and aware as la p'tite
don't think of this movies as just another kids movie the whole family can enjoy it its a strange mix of a movie as its seems to have a movie within it but at least it does make sense at the end modern films it does give you all the elements of a film plot good characters well it does star the muppets a list of lesser which films would clamour for what is surprising is the fact that it can be a roller coaster of emotions some sad some heartwarming some funny and some serious it all makes an enjoyable family film that everyone can watch the celebs in the film are actually top stars of the day but there is only one true star of the film and no one dare outshine miss piggy
with a minimal budget a running time of eight minutes and a great amount of imagination nacho vigalondo has achieved one of the most moving shorts i've ever seen the subtlety of the screenplay is really remarkable since it doesn't give the ending away until the very last let anybody tell you what the short is about since you'll be able to enjoy it a lot more nacho vigalondo is the discovery of the year for his one-man show directing writing and acting in this formidable short is the most remarkable effort i've seen in years also pay attention to the performance of marta belenguer her reaction shots are rating
famous words of foreign nightclub owner roman maroni that lousy cork sucker who spends the whole movie not only as johnny rival but butchering the english language as underrated classic that you can only find on afternoon matinées or late late late johnny dangerously is a terrific satirical hit about a good hearted boy who secretly leads a life of crime to help pay for his medical care and put his brother through law a story but who cares a cast that includes joe piscopo dom deluise marilu henner and alan hale jr will keep you waiting to see what happens too many laughs in this to put on here like airplane you have to pay attention or you'll miss something highly recommended to anyone who can use a good laugh or two
i guess every time i see one of these old movies from the it puts me back at a simpler time no matter how corny they may seem today this movie is a good one i remember seeing it as a small kid and thinking it was the greatest movie ever it has all the heroistic characters that a young cowboy wants to be now as an adult i can look back and laugh and still feel sad but this time i actually know going on i did find one thing weird how many people can move to houston and hook up with into a a falling have an uncle get back together all in the course of a month only in america
this movie was hysterical i haven't laughed this hard in a long time i mean not good will hunting but was it supposed to be i actually went into the advanced screening expecting a lot less and was pleasantly surprised the comedy hits hard and is fairly constant amanda peet is hot and awesome the entire audience that i screened it with seemed to be enjoying the film as much as i did
i am so glad that i got a chance to see this rare little gem of a movie i saw it at an independent film festival so don't expect it to come to your town anytime soon during the film i noticed about people get up and walk out too bad for them here in the south folks don't like having to read subtitles the movie starts out slow but is so rich in dialogue that i never felt bored when the action finally arrives i found myself glued to the screen as if i were riding a roller also got a big kick of the chapter titles appearing before the chapters especially the ones that introduce the characters as they appear on screen it reminded me of zelda of time when you face level this is the future of video book movies then i welcome it
this movie made me very happy impossible not to love the smart and sweet orphan girl who changes the heart of a selfish lawyer only interested in pursuing success in her career this is a very optimistic movie and i sincerely believe that we need more films like curly sue it touched my heart
like his earlier film in a glass cage agustí villaronga achieves an intense and highly poetic canvas that is even more refined visually than its predecessor this is one of the most visually accomplished and haunting pictures one could ever see the heightened drama intensity and undertone of violence threatens on the the melodramatic or farcical yet never steps into it in that way it pulls off an almost impossible feat to be so over-the-top and yet so painfully restrained to be so charged and yet so understated and even the explosives finales are virtuosic feasts of the eye unabashed gorgeous and highly tense this film is simply superb
the film notes describe the main role family as turkish immigrants which living in denmark however it is so clear to understand that the fact is the behavior and the culture point the family is absolute kurdish similar social pressures and even cultural murders keep going on turkey today on kurdish ethnicity societies what a is widely accepted issue in turkey today the kurdish immigrants living in european countries today which have moved from turkey at are culturally connected to the feudal moral laws system by growing daughters and women under pressure are giving harm to the turkish international image also as same as widely accepted another issue is the turkish or kurdish immigrants on these countries are the reason negative aim about the community europe nominee
this masterpiece of lesbian horror comes from exploitation master joseph features plenty of soft core hot lesbian sequences plus a lot of naked acting is pretty good and the film is quite atmospheric and forsa is one of the hottest chicks i have ever seen in a horror a visual pleasure to see her wonderful really knows how to pick up hot looking must see for fans of sexploitation
i just saw this movie on hbo and it was really tragic love story indeed i really appreciated the fact that the guy at the heart of the story had lost the use of his legs in an accident rare to see a love story involving someone who is physically handicapped the love that developed between that character and the woman who comes into his life nicely portrayed how i'd like to think love can heal heart laura of when she made this great as the woman so full of life able to revive this heart unfortunately since his family is wealthy and is not problems playing on hbo some more times this month check out the schedule here
what a class bit of british cinema about time and a side splitting comedy to searching to relive a bit of freedom from their misspent youth this road movie will prove the a mix between withnail and i and easy rider the movie runs at a solid pace and doesn't let you drift off for too long at times there are reflective moments but i think they are well justified and add to the characters the actors are portraying i was a little concerned with phil daniels character at the start but thankfully was won over half way through in what was one of the funniest scenes of the entire movie generally i found myself belly laughing through the film most likely annoying some people around me oh would thoroughly recommend it this will become a cult british comedy well worth a visit
this isn't masterpiece theater you shouldn't go into it expecting that this is pure girl fun with the most fantastic cast of female leads like someone else here said this is the film baby mama was meant to be and the only downside i see to this film is that tina fey was not in besides that it stars the smartest and brightest girls on the planet the film is pure silliness on the surface but if you really watch you will know it has a lot of messages and deep meaning to any of us who wish they could go back and do it all over again in life knowing then what we know now pure fun and i recommend it to anyone looking for minutes of great escape
playing out as a sort of pre runner to the great escape some years later this smashing little british film plays it straight with no thrills and dare do well overkill first part of the movie is the set up and subsequent escape of our protagonists whilst the second part concentrates on their survival whilst on the run as they try to reach sweden the film relies on pure characters with simple effective and yes believable dialogue to carry it thru and it achieves its aims handsomely no little amount of suspense keeps the film ticking along and as an adventure story it works perfectly for the time frame it adheres to so a big thumbs to the film that may well be the first of its type
about the importance of being young having friends and most of all enjoying life through the experience of four friends ligabue shows to the audience how life was back in the in a small italian village the four carachters represent the four different aspects of human behavior also the drug experience is well represented
i loved this movie when i saw it on febuary i knew i had to buy it it comes out to buy on july it has cool deaths scenes hot girls great cast good story good acting great slasher film the movies is about some serial killer killing off four girls see this movies
such a film of beauty that hard to describe maybe the absence of superfluous dialogue or maybe the absolutely stellar soundtrack or maybe just meena feet but a joy to watch this movie again and again i've never seen another indian movie that comes close to it and few from any country rival its perfection
the previous reviewer has said it exactly i saw it once was enchanted saw it a second time when it was re-broadcast within a week or two of the first airing i still remember some of the scenes the setting is the opening of the century the war referred to in the title is world war i one of the scenes was set in a women-only section of a public place which was an interesting historical note the moment when one of the women first touches the other is one of my all-time great movie moments i don't think of this as a gay movie an interesting and tender period love story where the two principals happen to be women i would love to see this movie again i would buy this one if it ever came out on dvd
i've watched this movie a number of times and found it to be very good this movie is also known as castle of terror coffin of terror and dance macabre barbara steele is her usual self george riviere the male lead does a good job with his role the whole movie is dripping with atmosphere and there is a good deal of tension throughout the camera angles are good and the acting for the most part isn't bad this film is quite suitable for a rainy day or evening i have the dvd uncut version which is far superior to the edited tv version grab some popcorn turn out the lights settle back and enjoy john r tracy
of course i would have to give this film out of as my uncle was the main screenplay writer of once upon a crime rodolfo sonego wrote screenplays for over years living in italy he was a great story teller and someone suggested that he put his stories into writing so rodolfo sonego did if you check out his biography you can see the number of movies that have been made in italy alberto sordie was the main actor that starred in his stories my uncle visited australia and my town in to check out locations for a girl in australia and created a great movie about a proxy bride after the second world war you can see his humor in all his movies i found a copy of this movie on dvd recently great
i am totally addicted to this show i can't wait till the week goes by to see the next showing a great story line and it has the best actors and actresses on the show i will tune in every week to watch it even if i am not home i always have my vcr set to tape monarch cove simon rex is the best actor on the show it is suspenseful and exciting i think this show should stay on the air and i believe everyone should tune in to watch it i saw the very first episode and actually i wasn't going to watch it but i was watching lifetime one day and i decided to watch it because it was on and i absolutely love it and right now my favorite show i am really mean it
i first see this film almost years ago when it was an itv the days of cable and satellite matinée i was off school with the mumps and i was totally wrapped in the film i have had it on bought video for about years and i want to obtain a dvd copy of it david niven is my all time favourite actor and i think it is a travesty that he was over looked so many times when the oscars came around i also think that the queen should have knighted him as he easily did as much for the movie industry if not more than sean connery or anthony hopkins the way the film switches from black and white to colour and back again is well done and the film has such stellar actors as roger livesy marius goring and an early appearance from richard attenborough
dominion tank police is an exercise in contradictive film making the storyline across the parts blends mindless action slap-stick humor touching humanity and thought provoking philosophical questions hard to believe that there was only one director as the style changes from episode to episode a must-see movie for anyone who likes anime
this is truly an excellent film with a revolutionary message in form and content that should not be missed by any fan of french new wave or underground film there are barely opening or closing are just dropped into the world of consumerist art revolution and youth this film has little to do with documentary and is more interesting in playing with our ideas of advertising and its relationship to reality lines of real and not real are crossed in ways familiar with films discussing documentary but this time we do it for the sake of consuming and marketing not for describing the real
this is one of the few comedies i can watch again and again and still laugh out loud in other places i have read complaints about racism and sexism from sanctimonious politically correct prigs there is neither here unless you define sexism as a woman as housewife and racism as a family employing a colored lines are hilarious and all the leads have never been better melvin douglas is especially you've ever thought of or tried to build a new house you will be relieved to know that no matter how infuriating the process no matter how much a lamb among wolves you may feel you are not alone
i have things to come on and very clear compared to my vhs version the audio is fair but can be hard to understand at times liked the movie so much that i searched for a copy of the book and found gave details of why some things happened the best things about the movie are the small things that i didn't notice at first such as john cabal playing with a toy airplane at a christmass party like it was a dive bomber out dateing sea power by naming a ships sunk by air-power an undeclared enemy sneak attack by airplanes swept flying wing planes strong rolls for the women through the entire movie are more see the movie to enjoy them
heartland was in production about the same time as michael gate heartland cost a fraction to make but is times the piece of gate was the biggest and most expensive mil in hollywood flops of all time its failure resulted in the sale of the united artists studio to mgm entry cost a few hundred thousand dollars and benefits from great writing direction photography and acting it easily draws you into the beauty joys hardships and sorrow of pioneer sad that hollywood sometimes would pour millions into turkeys on a single big hit and neglect such a wonderful story
saw the glacier fox in the theatre when i was nine years old i bugged my parents to take me back three times i began looking for it on video about five years ago finally uncovering a copy on an online auction site but i would love to see it either picked up by a new distributor and rereleased understand the original video run was small or have the rights purchased by the family channel disney etc and shown regularly it is a fascinating film that draws you into the story of the life struggle of a family of foxes in northern japan narrated by a wise old tree the excellent soundtrack compliments the film well it would be a good seller today better than many of the weak offerings to movies today
damn was that a lot to take in i was pretty much mesmerised throughout it was pretty perfect though i would say the editing had a lot to do with that i can't believe this guy stayed on good terms with the lot of them especially to get all of this footage without any serious beef the did come off well-together middle-class kids who took advantage of their situation rightly so i felt bad for jonestown and especially for anton which maybe wasn't what a lot of other people felt great piece of film-making and great choice of i recommend this to any fan you'll probably learn something about film-making
i liked this movie a rented this expecting something not too bad to spend an turned out a particularly satisfying experience some scenes were hilarious and managed to be so in a movie not intended to be just a stupid slapstick comedy but with some meaning and moral manages on both leads are all good but especially the guy who wrote and produced the never seen any of these actors before but they were likable and made me care about what happens to them in the end which is saying a script is clever and involving and has a refreshing feel to it i think you wont be disappointed to watch this
i really enjoyed this drama from sidney lumet the best word i could come up to describe it with is insane it throws the viewer around for an hour and fifty minutes and doesn't let you breathe until the credits start to roll at the very end trust me this movie will keep you guessing the entire way story is very well crafted and almost brilliant almost like a more complicated tarantino type story the acting is all amazing from all of the leads and even the small parts excellent cast i also loved the cinematography it gave it the real feeling as if it were an independent film it was all movie is excited exhausting and heartbreaking almost hard to watch but you'll be glad that you did
actually that video camera effect is just that an effect a rather good one don't know much about directing a film do you this film is in fact better than the original great fun to watch made for tv doesn't need to follow any rules i find it hard to watch number because of how he kills the first girl its disturbing and all the time we are routing for judd nelson to get away with it we as the viewers are on his side i hope one day we will see a cabin by the lake but i doubt it watching this film you can understand how real movies are made as this is sort of like a film within a film judd is one of the scariest villains ever and more realistic he doesn't just mindlessly chop people up like in other horrors
a great storyline with a message joan plowright is superb as phoebe mike kopsa is hilarious as coach and richard de klerk plays the role of carmine superbly mischa barton as frankie puts in a good performance and ingrid as hazel plays her first lead extremely well this film is superbly directed by jo-beth williams the editing is first rate
witty funny intelligent awesome i was flipping channels late one night years ago came across this and a wildfire started i was staying up late every night and taping it for everyone i know a few like people out of the almost people i made watch this didn't think it was as awesome as i did the others were laughing out loud so hard they were crying and thanking me at the same time please do yourself a favor run don't walk watch this and enjoy intelligence and humor a win-win situation i wish i could have afternoon tea with him and meet the truly rare comedian that we as a society need more
i can't see the point in burying a movie like this in sulfuric sarcasm when it is in no way intended to be anything more than a vehicle to entertain children and prepare them for the next line of merchandise to beg madly this is a fun movie my children sat quietly through the entire thing and loved every minute of it granted the villain is a bit over the top with his silly costume and maniacal laugher but this is a lot more easier to take than the dark gloomy and very morbid pokemon my children have been watching pokemon since it started and they are soon getting to the ages where they will put off the childish things and move on to others i am glad that we got to enjoy this together
i remember first watching sabrina when it came to tv in the uk on when i was i'm now and still love it now as much as i did when i first watched it i get a little stick from some of my friends for still watching a kids show but i don't care lol caroline rhea as hilda is my personal favourite character and later on morgan also became another of my favourite characters i remember spending so much time watching various special events honouring sabrina on the tv station nickeleoden uk i love mellissa joan-hart she was great in clarrissa explains all but so much better in this i was gutted when they decided to finish it i hope it will soon be released on dvd here in the uk i'll be first in line lol x
this is a great first saw this film when it came out i just recently saw this film again and it still holds up to my memory of it a lot of films we watched when we were younger don't seem to hold up when we watch them later in life the film is actually a great example of the type of films made then keaton is at his best all the actors actually did a very good job and ron howard was very good at letting the story push the movie along instead forcing it the pace of the film is fast with few slow spots and seeing the cars from the is too funny being from the i loved seeing the ugly pacer again the film is a great film for any comedy lovers and film lovers
a must see by all if you have to borrow your neighbors kid to see this one easily one of the best released in a long-time it took the the movies antz to a whole new level do not mistake the two as being the same movie although in principle the movies plot is similiar just go and enjoy
in young john trilogy of blockbusters he dances to disco rock n roll and country he heads to houston to find work and love is the hot spot and it is the time of the mechanical bull not to be outdone i rode the bull at a club in nashville i recently saw this nearly forgotten film on television and remembered how good it was and how good a year was i wore a black cowboy hat that year just like travolta debra winger was in her prime she looks stunning in her red top there is plenty of charisma bud and sissy seem the ideal couple even if they are trailer trash they split up just because it feels so good getting back together urban cowboy has an amazing soundtrack we get to hear lyin eyes by the eagles and lookin for love by johnny lee
when i saw this movie i was stunned by what a great movie it was this is the only movie i think i would ever give a star rating i am sure this movie will always be in my top acting is superb leonardo dicaprio and kate winslett are at their best i don't think anyone could have a better job than kate it is a rainy day and you can't decide what to rent well this is the one you will love all the acting special effects and much much you have not seen this movie go rent or buy it now you won't regret
a classic cartoon always enjoyable and funny it has an interesting plot complete with lovable characters road rovers is a show worth seeing it is a short episodes and if you can ever manage a chance to see it you should unfortunately it is very hard to find i think warner brothers studios should release a dvd that contains all episodes i would definitely buy it if they did and if they do you should buy it too if you have kids who like dogs they will love road rovers road rovers should have gotten more attention while it was being aired it was definitely an original and very special show that should have been appreciated much more than it was
i have had the pleasure of reading martin book can't find my way home which is chock full of info on the drug culture of america spanning the years this guy knows his stuff i found him to be an excellent spokesperson for this documentary i particularly enjoyed watching the film clips from the hippie era and the stoner culture the soundtrack was excellent whoever compiled it definitely was in touch with the tunes of each era hopefully they will package them and sell them as a cd set i would highly recommend this to anyone interested in how the experiments with lsd forever changed american culture as we know it one thing that was missing was any mention of george jung by johnny depp in the movie blow who was supposedly responsible for much of the marijuana and cocaine coming into this country in the
this show has a few clichés and a few over the top creek-like moments talking about way back when life made sense but overall it seems like a decent show most of the characters seem very real and the story seemed to move along well in the pilot ending with a good lesson in the end i just hope every episode doesn't turn out to be life-altering like the first that would just be too much drama for this vehicle jeremy sumpter does an excellent job as a teenager with a passion for baseball i believe a lot of us could relate to his awe and sometimes tunnel vision for the team that he always wanted to a part of
baseketball is an extremely funny movie that delivers acting that generally makes the movie alot material that is more than crap in your pants a pretty good plot despite the fact that its the classic slackers the evil rich one and only thing i didnt like about that that kid wasnt really needed in the the kid wasnt in the of the funny scenes wouldnt have you have read any pro reviews about this them all because basically all the reviewers didnt like this is a great comedy that gives everyone what they out of
this movie is great simply it is rare that you find a comedy with levels and this is a bloody good example of such when i saw this movie first as the credit rolled a friend and i looked to one another and asked did you just catch that for those doubters look at the levels see the comparisons between vick and the people in the club the dna see the diverse characters each jostling for position and if you see nothing else see the connection between the cure of vick and the path through the film all in head the opening line about world the closing scene with the camera going into head and inside a whole universe thoroughly quotable wonderful cartoon gangsters beautiful beautiful beautiful
here comes the romeo division to change the me just say that i was blown away by this short film i saw it randomly when i was in boston at a film festival and i have thanked god for it every day since i really truly believe i was part of a happening like reading a tarantino script before any else did or seeing the first screening of mean am not sure what festival the short is headed to next or what the creative team has on tap for future products but i so hope i can be there for a truly incredible piece of film making
an excellent period murder melodrama with fontaine effectively playing against her earlier naive wallflower type in a role that reportedly olivia dehavilland turned down fine because fontaine is wonderful scripted by charles bennett who had written for hitchcock in the thirties and also later penned the excellent script for the classic british horror film night of the demon the opening scene where ivy visits a sinister fortune teller played by the wonderful una o'connor screecher of james whale fame is a tour de force and the film maintains interest throughout the numerous sinister machinations i hope to see this film on dvd someday but despair of that ever happening because it seems to be an undeservedly obscure film fortunately i got to see it on amc some seven or eight years ago but have not seen since catch it if you can
just saw this movie today at the seattle international film festival and enjoyed it writing and direction excellent and believable interaction among the cast and great comic timing as movie touches on themes that are universal-family and separation as a result i can see european asian and american audiences all finding points of similarity between this film and their own all that wasn't enough this has the potential to be the best underground date movie of the distribute this in the usa thank you maria flom it really is a great film
the first of the tarzan movies staring johnny weissmuller the plot has already been summarized so i wont go into it again just know that the actors who play jane and tarzan were born for the role if you have not seen this film and you only have the modern day tarzan films as a are missing a real treat doesn't matter how far we've come in movie making makeup set one will ever play tarzan as well as johnny weissmuller did he was and is tarzan
this movie was such a blast it has that feel-good yet totally in your face attitude that draws me to a movie it has a good message girl decides she needs a real job yet she doesn't completely lose all sense of fun i recommend this movie for anyone who needs some humor but is also a thinker
i love eddie izzard i think this is awesome and the other television specials should be looked at as well he has a good book dress to kill out to buy as well which i think people should read i loved that this program won an emmy and anyone who likes history will probably get a laugh from eddie enjoy
i saw this movie at midnight on on demand the other night not knowing what to expect i had heard of this movie but never really any opinions on have to say i was impressed with what i saw i was genuinely freaked out in some parts and i definitely recall jumping up in my seat a few blob was scary looking now i look in a jar of jelly and wonder if it'll latch itself onto my mcqueen was really good as steve andrews the protagonist of the film i also liked the old man in the a horror movie this was very well done even by
if you're as huge of a fan of an author as i am of jim thompson it can be pretty dodgy when their works are converted to film this is not the case with scott rendition of after dark my sweet a suspenseful sexually charged noir classic that closely follows and does great justice to the original text jason patrick and rachel ward give possibly the best performances of their careers and the always phenomenal bruce dern might have even toped him self with this one like book this movie creates a dark and surreal world where passion overcomes logic and the double cross is never far at hand a must see for all fans of great noir film
impactful film of four city slickers in crisis in appalachia has become synonymous with rural depravity each of four businessmen face their darkest fears when they tackle a challenging whitewater trip on a river about to be replaced by a dam when locals along the way decide to have their way with the interlopers it leads to several deaths and loads of trauma for the survivors each of the travelers is outstanding although voight gives the lead and strongest performance the rural scenery and culture is well-captured including the breathtaking dueling banjos sequence i saw this on a date when it came out not exactly the perfect date movie we both enjoyed it i sort of remember this as a break-out dramatic performance for burt voight was already established not the sort of movie you could watch every week but it has a strong punch and is beautifully filmed
this film has great acting great photography and a very strong story line that really makes you think about who you are how you define yourself how you fit in whether you accept to play a role or break free there already are excellent comments dealing with these aspects i want to comment on the formal setting of the film basically two people on a roof there is unity of place and time with protagonists and the radio acting as the choir many directors have turned greek tragedies into film many directors have filmed contemporary stories as if they were a greek tragedy but no director in my opinion has succeeded as admirably as ettore scola in approaching the purity and force of the great greek tragedies both in story line and formal setting a masterpiece
i waited ages before seeing this as all the reviews i read of this said it was horrible i rented it expecting the worst and while it is hardly the best sandler film out there there are much worse sandler frequently talks to the camera and the film does not take itself seriously but that is all part of the fun a great way to waste an afternoon and you might even find yourself laughing once a twice a good film well worth renting
this is one of the most interesting movies i have ever seen i love the backwoods feel of this movie the movie is very realistic and believable this seems to take place in another era maybe the late or early henry thomas works well with the young baby very moving story and worth a look
this movie brought tears to my eyes john roberts really knew how to get to viewers hearts directing this wonderful picture where life is viewed through the mind and heart of paulie we discover from time to time with the help of sensitive and talented directors like john that even small creatures like paulie have a heart i just couldn't stop my tears even though the film has a happy end this is great after thousands of films i saw through my life paulie really touched me deeply this is after the ugly duckling the second picture that really turned me upside down
i was delighted to finally see the release of amazing stories the first season on dvd i had forgotten just what a stellar cast of actors and directors worked on this series for the longest time the only way you got to see this remarkable series was with the vhs or episode collections or when sci-fi would re-run the episodes however when sci-fi would host the re-runs they generally stuck to the same episodes there were a few outstanding episodes in season one like the mission that they didn't repeat does anyone know exactly how long this series ran it says to at the top here at imdb but i thought it ran longer than two years if you loved the twilight zone night gallery and outer limits you will love this series and you will not be disappointed with your purchase
i waited and waited for this film to come trailers seemed to be on for years it was worth it i'm not a big fan of watching films over and over again but i cant wait for this to come out for all to buy not a big fan of jim but this suited him perfectly there was so much to see and the feel good factor is off the scale perfect for christmas i think ron did a fab job turning this into a film if you haven't seen it then do so if you have watch it again i know you want to
the word classic is thrown around too loosely nowadays but this movie well deserves the appelation the combination of neil simon walter matthau the best living comic actor and the late lamented george burns make for a comic masterpiece it is interesting to contemplate what the movie would have been like had not death prevented jack benny from playing george burns part as had been planned as it is the reunion scene in apartment is not likely to be surpassed as a sidesplitter definitely one of my desert island
to communicate in film essential things of life like what is life does it have a meaning is sheer impossible of course possible answers to these questions are demonstrated in every film but communication needs a direct appeal to consciousness this happens if the input from the senses overrules the input from our mind our thoughts few directors know how to communicate essential things tarkovsky is one his stalker shows images of existence communicates life as it shows itself and yet escapes your mind i think de zee and de graaff do the same
it ran from its more than its longevity that says a lot for this series its also that it survived changes in fashion and taste from the psychedelic and remained popular in the remember repeats of this series it was a successful combination of all its elements from stories cast and productions that made it exceptional lorne green had his defining iconic character from this series its appeal was across generations all members of the family could enjoy this it balanced morality with violence humour with seriousness a cartoon series was made as a spin off from this as a result of its impact the shame is that this series is no longer repeated and many will not know its significance
this movie is hilarious i watched it with my friend and we just had to see it again this movie is not for you movie-goers who will only watch the films that are nominated for academy awards know who you won't recap it because you have seen that from all the other is a light-hearted comedy that had me laughing throughout it doesn't take itself too seriously and should be watched with your friends not your girlfriend it won't win any awards but it just has to be watched to be appreciated true some of the jokes are toilet humor but that is not necessarily a bad thing everyone can use some of it sometimes some people need to lighten up and see whipped for what it is not what it out of
the first time i saw this film i loved it it was am a christian believing i don't go along with the crowd of right wing believers i dropped out of that me in their attempts to take over our government they are doing what judas tried to do i call it the judas didn't get it even though jesus said his kingdom was not of this film certainly showed some of also liked that jesus enjoyed the simple pleasure of playing games and jokes with his he was a very gorgeous a watch-over and over satisfying
i just saw valentine and i have to say that it was the best slasher movie that i've seen in years unlike the recent trend of horror flicks this movie is more concerned with being eerie than it is with being self-mocking for those out there that hated scream there is not one reference to the horror rules in this movie though the old slasher movie rules do apply here is the perfect blend of and horror you get the style cinematography and good acting of films and the stalking-slasher madness of an flick i guess the year is going to finally give horror fans the kind of movies they were longing for this is definitely a move in the right richards stands out here as a fun character you can tell she liked her role and that makes her stand out i loved her in this movie
what another reviewer called lack of character development i call understatement the movie didn't bash one over the head with overexplanation or unnecessary backstory yes there were many untold stories that we only got a glimpse of but this was primarily a one-day snapshot into an event that catalyzed change in all of the characters lives henry performance was a really lovely study in the power of acting that focuses on reaction rather than action good rental
der second full-length feature first one was notorious no central character or instead thematic continuity in the act of into days of the comprises of a series of of which featuring the self-destruction of a complete production values are low and in many ways der todesking is extremely makes you think which is sometimes more important than pure the other works it isn't very there are some unpleasant images like castration scene in the tuesday decomposing corpse and various acts of is so depressing and full of amazing if you want my out of out this post-modernism art in the purest form
i thought that it was a great film for kids ages a little sappy but the story is uplifting an fresh it proves that the dreams of an adolescent can truly come true i think that a great story for any kid who is feelings down or feels as if there trying to juggle too many things among them very cute film bravo
the movie celebrates world is setting itself for the innocent and the pure souls and everything has happy end just like in the closing scene of the movie has wonderful soundtrack mixture of serbian neofolk gypsy music and movie is very refreshing piece of visual watching experience is like you've been sucked in another colorful romantic and sometimes rough mr kusturica movie should be
one of the best movie-dramas i have ever seen we do a lot of acting in the church and this is one that can be used as a resource that highlights all the good things that actors can do in their work i highly recommend this one especially for those who have an interest in acting as a must see there are several scenes of note for one the graveyard scene when hamlet encounters yorick knows about that scene by just going to elementary school and his interaction with the skull was extremely well done the logic used in this scene was suppose a testament to shakespeare more than anything else for a second i very much enjoyed the scene where hamlet horatio and the character played by robin williams discussed the upcoming duel
this was a great movie with a good cast all of them hitting on all cylinders and when dianne keaton is at her best well it just doesn't get any better than that but tom everett scott always underrated was even better he should be a star only complaint is with one aspect of the screenplay none of the characters ever acknowledged that the dead daughter wasn't always a good person and neither was her mother played by keaton at one point she breaks a promise she made to one character not to reveal that he had been sleeping around of the other commentators said the movie had a political agenda that is a baffling thing to say there was no politics at all in this movie
this movie probably would only get a or from me to tell the truth if i had seen trailers or had any kind of knowledge of what the film is all about since it was virtually all a surprise it was almost a perfect piece of edgy entertainment that gets a strong from read through some of the comments briefly and saw that someone else had almost the same experience as me and he advised to just watch it it was good advice read the rest at your own risk of mendez plays a head-strong success-starved network tv programmer that took a joke made by a co-worker while brain-storming tv program ideas about russian roulette seriously the story follows her in a documentary style on her pursuit to make this happen
personally i think sayonara was the greatest movie he ever made it touched every emotion from anger to romance to complete tragedy and brando should have won for best actor anyway the movie is awesome the man is attractive to both men and women and now you have no reason not to see it do so and fall in love
kurt russell is elvis plain and simple his dedication to this role resulted in what i think is the best movie bio ever if you're an elvis fan see it if you made-for-television film was made two years after elvis piece of advice there are two versions one at minutes and one at minutes the only one to watch is the longer one the shorter one has more than one hour of footage edited out it just does not work because the scenes in it are often dependent on the scenes that were masterpiece takes you from elvis childhood through his emergence as greatest star shelley winters and bing russell real dad are excellent as elvis parents and pat hingle delivers a very competent col tom live the king
this movie of minutes was aired by the italian public television during the early seventies it tells you the myth attributed to homer of the journey home of odysseus after the troy war it is an epic story about the ancient minoan and mycenaean civilizations told at list years after those events toke place around is a movie so if you buy the dvd version you would find that the sound is just mono and there is no other language than italian even the close caption is in italian pity many people would enjoy this masterpiece if it had at list the english subtitles but if this is not a problem for you than i would strongly recommend to watch this movie
this tale based on two edgar allen poe pieces fall of the house of usher dance of death is actually quite creepy from beginning to end it is similar to some of the old black-and-white movies about people that meet in an old decrepit house example the cat and the canary the old dark house night of terror and so on boris karloff plays a demented inventor of life-size dolls that terrorize the guests he dies early in the film does he and the residents of the house are subjected to a number of terrifying experiences i won't go into too much detail here but it is definitely a must-see for fans of old dark house it with plenty of popcorn and soda in a darkened basinger
this man is nothing short of amazing you truly feel as if you have lived his life with him throughout these tragic events and cry along with his family in the end he was so passionate about his cause not just for himself but to ensure others who will survive him do not have to go through this wretched pain i watch this video every time i am having a bad or down day and it always manages to make me see the great and brighter side of life just like jonny did even with his unbearable pain my only regret is not knowing about jonny sooner as i visited england times during his life and would have been able to say i'd met him it is comforting to know jonny is sitting on his cloud pain free rest in peace dear jonny you deserve it

passing stones definitely one of the best comedy independent films ever you must have a sense of humor to fully enjoy this one this film for some reason hasn't received its credit due first lets start with the story line everyone loves a good treasure hunt when a dead father leaves letters behind advising of a hidden treasure it not only brings two families together but starts a whirlwind adventure mix in a polish translator a comatose mother a crack-head with turrets syndrome a twisted homosexual hypnotist and one drag queen money not only makes the world go round but can turn family into enemies my favorite character in this film would have to be the addict with sudden out burst will have you crying and mimicking for weeks
jessica max and valerie rae original cindy shines in this actionpacked and atmospheric serial wonderfully politically incorrect quality varies greatly from episode to episode but generally the standard is high and when it is not jessica is always worth looking at urban jivetalking afroamerican is occationally almost dragging dark angel into sitcom territory
i saw this film earlier today and i was amazed at how accurate the dialog is for the main characters it didn't feel like a film it felt more like a documentary part i liked best the leading ladies in this film seemed as real to me as any fifteen year-old girls i in all a very enjoyable film for those who enjoy independent films
i rented this for my son who is recently found interest in he was a kindergartener at the time and had no idea what was unfolding i liked the way it was told as a documentary if there was one movie that i would recommend to see concerning this would be the one normally you see a movie it has actors that are well known this movie had nobody known also you see a movie concerning you hear about a fire-fighter or two losing their lives saving people i didn't feel this had any of that i only rented this movie and would definitely consider adding it to my collection very well done indeed my heart goes out to the survivors and families of victims of
this is one of the best movies i have seen in a long time all of you who regard this movie as absolute obviusly are not intelligent enough to grasp all of the subtle humor that this movie has to offer it shows us that real life and ficticious action can produce a winning combination also as a romantic comedy it has one of the most clever ways for two people to find each other name me another movie where you can see all of that as well as donald sutherland singing a song like they're going to find your anus on a mountain on mars
besides planes trains and automobiles and uncle buck this is john funniest movie when he gets hypnotized with the playing card to the manchurian candidate and becomes a horny guy who does not know what he is saying he makes two very memorable quotes deal with the male anatomy the love scene involving grocery items has to be seen it cannot be
this movie makes me want to fall in love all over am naming my next daughter adelaide just so that someone who sings like ol blue eyes can swoon her one day and feel the butterflies i felt hearing it sung and it wasn't even to me i give it a
my tutor friend is a well scripted romance comedy movie that has something similar to my sassy girl no scenes hollywood should learn more from korean productions sex is not always required in a good romantic movie is of light hearted tone with occasional cartoon cg scenes blended into the movie i like the part when ji-hoon almost kissed su-wan the funniest moment is when ji-hoon punched first love because he dumped su-wan for another girl and he is going to be a father soon how he became a father was revealed in the next scene which brings smiles to the points
a great film requiring an acquired taste if you're into action wham bam films and hate serious love stories then its not for you otherwise if you like to sit in front of a good intelligent movie now and again i recommend this very highly easily the best film produced in bollywood this only other indian film i would give for is dil wale dulhaniya le jayenge even then it comes second to this masterpiece
this movie has its ups and downs but to me the good stuff in this movie very much outweighs the not so good about the movie are indeed sometimes the dialogue the sounds the i the only one who noticed the way the sets were lighted was amateur and the is very good are the highly original storyline the very intense atmosphere the gore factor which is very high and the effects which are done definitely worth watching or maybe even a must-see for all you horror and gore fans

just read the original story which is written by pu in century strikingly the movie despict the original spirit very well though the plot was modified tremendously the film language the rhythm the special effect are all from hollywood but still there is a chinese core it is amazing how hark tsui managed to combine them together the result is pure beauty
i really enjoyed this was fifteen when this movie came out and i could relate this will be a movie i would show my kids to let them know the feelings they are having are normal it is funny to see how we could be so devestated by things at such a young knew that we would bounce and movie
this film is a very good way how the everybody portrayed their roles was story is tells us about raj who is in love with get later becomes shortly their is a they wont get the later meets bribes later becomes pregnant but she is not married to movie is very dialogues are songs are melodious to picturisations are wedding song is very were excellent the cinematography is film is beautifully pictured in cast makes the movie great to the money and time
this film is underrated i loved it it was truly sweet and heartfelt a family who struggles but isn't made into a dysfunctional family which is so typical of films today the film didn't make it an issue that they have little money or are dominican republican the way hollywood the issue is victor is immature and needs to grow up he does slowly by the end he has a ways to go but it was a heartfelt attempt to move forward his grandmother is very cute and the scene where the little boy throws up had me laughing for the longest time a truly heartfelt indie
the odd couple is one of those movies that far surpasses its reputation people all know it they hum the theme song they complain of living with a sloppy oscar or a fastidious they're under-selling the film without knowing it this isn't just about a neat guy living with a sloppy guy a portrait of two friends helping each other through the agony of divorce also damn funny from start to finish but the kind of comedy that arises from realistic stressful and just plain awful situations so some viewers have actually found the film to be a bit uncomfortable but i think its verisimilitude is its strength besides bulldog face just cracks me up my favorite comedy by a country mile
toi le venin is robert one of the great thrillers of the on a frederic dard writer the director often worked with also le monte-charge which hossein did not direct but in which he was the lead screenplay grabs you from the first pictures on a desert road by night where a beautiful blonde might be the fieriest of the criminals to the mysterious house where he finds his femme fatale and her begins a cat and mouse play one of the sisters is in a wheelchair but is she really one is the criminal who tried to kill the hero on that night two vlady and the late odile versois were off all the lights before suspenseful
movie is by far one of my favorites i saw it while in college in the early and while i couldn't identify with the thirtysomethings in the film i felt that the story characters and movie in general were top notch to the people who spoke negatively of indian summer feel free to stick to your overblown armageddon-type movies and leave the movies with a great wholesome story to those who can appreciate them
i enjoyed longstreet which followed in the steps of raymond successful ironside tv series and was intended to give it competition but this show was canceled after one season because it was believe longstreet was not able to compete with mr may add that the pilot for this show was especially well done and very memorable i hope that a box set of longstreet will should note that this story idea was only briefly explored here and that much more could and should be done to show the play and interplay of disabilities on tv
just as tom berenger put you into the soul of sgt barnes he has done it again with thomas beckett if i thought his world was folding in on him in the first scenes it was nothing compared to how much more i felt during the last scenes great movie even for a girl
lost is one of a so enchanting and full of suspense thrill and emotions all at the same have never seen any tv series like this before it is full of jungle thrills and has a good screenplay the actors have emoted life on an island in such a natural way that i feel lost in the island myself while watching is an excellent piece of work narrated in a very intelligent series is like a movie depicting the life of the survivors lost on a deserted am tempted to watch one episode after the other and i highly recommend this series for all the tv show it to see the magic of being lost in nowhere
fast paced and funny satire about that original reality tv the soap opera the script by playwright robert harling is packed with one liners and ridiculous situations the best of them is the climax a live broadcast that quickly deteriorates into bad improv and a brain transplant keven murdering of his lines due to not wearing his glasses is hilarious her brain will laterally explore within the next few houses the brilliant cast is on the same page as kline sally field elizabeth shue cathy moriarty robert downey jr whoopi goldberg teri hatcher garry marshall and kathy najimy are all perfect it is a treat to see a cast click like it does in this movie this is a classic that has somehow slipped through the the score by alan silvestri is an added bonus it fits the soap opera with flamboyant and melodramatic air
i appreciated the photography the textures the colours and often unlike one comment the lighting what was lacking for me was a coherent found it often disjointed badly edited and at times difficult to follow my version was minutes imdb shows one at possibly the cuts and subtitles didn't help i applaud any films that escape from the hollywood mould but this left me disappointed miss gillain was luminous and the performances were all fine i just wanted a little more dialogue if anyone would like to see another film that has some affinity with this one try hideous kinky'with kate winslet
with this topic it is so easy to take cheap shots you know the guy with hairy legs trying to look like marilyn monroe not here adrian pasdar does a superb job of making gerald a real person someone you care deeply about and as a result you feel for his plight trying to live both as gerald and geraldine not only that but as geraldine he looks hot and the chemistry between him and julie walters is electric these are two characters who feel love for one another and it comes through even when they simply look at each other over the breakfast table even the potentially cheesy sub-story line of corporate takeovers is believable and you find yourself cheering at the end at least i did
while hollywood got sort of stagnant during the few years after wwii england developed a very prolific film industry in the man in the white suit inventor sidney stratton guinness creates a suit that never gets dirty unfortunately this means that certain other businesses are now likely to go out of business how can sidney deal with this and maintain his dignity this is an example of one of the great movies in which alec guinness starred before he became obi wan kenobi a good look at the overall absurdity of the business world if you're planning to start any kind of business you might want to consider watching this movie
i don't remember when i first heard about this movie but i rented it about six years ago and it still remains one of my favorite comedies i will admit you probably will despise this movie if you know nothing about rap music but if you are a rap fan even a casual one you will love the inside jokes and references one of the best lines in the movie is about the difference between a and a i still use this line today and get lots of laughs with it one of the best performances comes from larry scott who played nerd lamar in of the nerds it is unfortunate that this movie will likely never get a dvd release
this light hearted comedy should be enjoyed for entertainment value it gets quite hysterically funny at times but if you haven't spent any time on that side of the tracks you will miss the comedy when it cast of characters meld well together and are quite believable in their roles how grace handles meeting her dead husbands girlfriend was well played a true lady and my favorite is white pimp suit that she highly recommend this flick to anyone who wants to laugh out loud who cheers for the underdog or just wishes to watch something different
i think this movie is absolutely beautiful and i'm not referring only to the breathtaking scenery about two unhappy english housewives who decide to rent an italian castle to take a break from their not so happy home lives in the end four women total rent the place together all with different personalities and different reasons for being there in this magically beautiful place they all find the peace they're longing for and interestingly that peace comes from inward reflections and resolutions more so than without i also find it wonderful because of the relationships that are developed out kindness and understanding the acting is a joy to watch in itself i especially love the characters of lottie lawrence and lady caroline walker
daniel day lewis in my left foot gives us one of the best performances ever by an actor he is brilliant as christy brown a man who has cerebral palsy who then learned to write and paint with his left foot a well deserved oscar for him and brenda fricker who plays his loving mother hugh o'conner is terrific as the younger christy brown and ray mcanally is great as the father worth watching for the outstanding performances
i probably saw this movie first in about since then i've returned to it many times great i especially like the first and second clips creation and civilization rising wow this was so cool back in the glory days of cg animation cg is way older than i am as i know the film tron was made years before my time but this film was a landmark in the early it was probably the first collaboration of different cg experiments set to music i like it so much i think i'll go watch it now bye
renny first american film was one of the best of a slew of prison-set horror death house or the the late years lane smith had wrongfully executed a condemned is the warden of the newly re-opened the ghost is back for bloody atmospheric and very moody film features lots of gruesome gore and everett and kane hodder are onhand for the entertaining carnage
to put it simply i enjoyed this film the reason for my interest enjoyment was not related to anything other than the subject matter itself i had heard tales from my mother and grandmother about how northern england working class life and attitudes used to be experienced by this is an interesting depiction that seems to faithfully represent what they told me in particular the paternalistic but overbearing father who knows what is best for his family along with his stubborness when this paradigm is challenged much has changed there who have seen the play will probably be disappointed with the film because the story does not easily transfer across the different media in a sense however the film is an historical document and i personally enjoyed it if only because of the way it conveyed a social phenomenon
i find this movie very enjoyable the plot is simple and easily digestible the humour is light and clean and because the storyline involving mistaken identity is quite common i find myself looking forward to how this movie flesh this story out turns out to be very nice the performance of the female lead is admirable her portrayal of an innocent naive girl trying to fabricate some white lies to sophisticated role was very charming i also find dancing very very well done i find myself drawn to her toes as she pranced about the stage effortlessly and those who have had enough of profanity-filled movies of today you will enjoy this movie thoroughly
and what a combo two of the great singers star together in this underrated musical he writes music she writes lyrics and they both work for basil rathbone who can't write either because his wife died she just got fat best scene is the pawn shop number where bing sings an impromptu number while the swing band gets their instruments out of hock just wonderful and this is a rare starring role for broadway legend mary martin and quite good charley grapewin john scott trotter william frawley oscar levant again the manic pianist charles lane and helen bertram co-star and who knew rathbone could be funny
i was privileged to have seen some snippets from original run of this show in the uk it was always fun and always funny none of the charm has been lost in as fresh as the people some of it is scripted or not as has been rumored is beside the point always animations shows great imagination in the characters used for each voice the single aspect that i probably love most about the show and its concept hostility between the pandas the porcupines discussing fear of needles the painting ape regulars really grow on you as well such as the horse and donkey teens from maryland most every married couple parrots the insects and the cats to name a few and child-voiced character and i've really come to dig the ferret finally become a day to which to look forward
the blob is a classic b-movie sci-fi flick you probably know the story two teens mcqueen aneta corsaut see a meteorite hit the ground and when they go to look for it they run into an old man with some attached to his arm they take him to the office and then go to find out what happened from there the blob spreads eating everyone in its path the special effects are cheesy fun as is the story there are a lot of great touches like the cop who plays chess over the radio with a cop in another district no masterpiece but it has a special place in its genre steve mcqueen is very good
starfucker reads starstruck on my box was the most amazing movie i have ever seen i thought that it was one of the best movies i have ever seen so why not a nothing is perfect jamie kennedy proves why he is one of my favorite actors in this very interesting look at a darker side of hollywood i have forced a few others to watch the movie and they all agreed that it was an outstanding flick
as others have mentioned all the women that go nude in this film are mostly absolutely gorgeous the plot very ably shows the hypocrisy of the female libido when men are around they want to be pursued but when no men are around they become the pursuers of a year old boy and the boy becomes a man really fast should all be so lucky at this age he then gets up the courage to pursue his true love
in all the comments praising or damning performance i thought he was excellent he does not play rochester as a spoiled pretty rich boy but as a roguish powerful man i liked this version although the shot on video aspect was sometimes distracting and the scenes with jane and st john never quite gelled i give this an
a damn good movie one that is seriously underrated the songs that the children sing in the movie gave me a sense of their pain but also their hope for the future whoopi goldberg puts in a good performance here but the best performance throughout the whole movie is that of the actress who plays the title character i wish she was in more movie should have a higher rating i give it a
the golden child was eddie first film since his megahit beverly hills cop and even though not as good as cop a fun comic adventure murphy stars as a finder of lost children assigned a most unusual case his assignment to find the title character a child with mystical powers this movie could have been titled beverly hills cop and the temple of doom since parts of this movie plays like a spielbergian adventure kinda like an indiana jones comedy got comedy with laughs and adventure with special effects lots of of four
it is a great movie i sow that some people think that this might not be based on a true story no matter this the movie is great and all u can think is not why a balloon with a mermaid on it ends up flying in the mermaid town and so on instead thinking that a little wish came true and this means that all our peaceful dreams will come true if we trust in us and do all in this world to make them true the little girl in the movie and her mom were the best actors i've been seen in a long time good for they for all actors all for the director if someone can tell them this please tell them a year guy from romania says thank you for making this movie
homeward bound is a beautiful film y'know the part where shadow falls down the ditch thingy i considering i was only six i cried it takes a lot to make me cry the dogs and the cat are excellently trained a nice family movie for completely hardened non-fluffy people or animal-haters but could for soft-as-crap people like good film overall
i am a member of a canoeing club and i can tell you the truth that deliverance is synonomous with the peacefulness and tranquility of the experience as we put our boats into the water banjoes echo in the back of the conscious mind this movie is timeless because it waxes philosophical of place in nature and effect upon relationship with nature we see it in the bow fishing we see it in the home made tent there is also city disdain and feeling of superiority to the rural woodsman cracker the fact that the banker from atlanta beatty has bad teeth is meant to put him on the same level with the woodsmen who also have bad teeth ultimately the struggle of life and death supersedes civilized suppositives about the law this canoe trip ends too soon for the viewer but alas not soon enough for the characters
joan fontaine stars as the villain in this victorian era film she convincingly plays the married woman who has a lover on the side and also sets her sights on a wealthy man miles rushworth who is played by herbert marshall mr marshall is quite good as miles miss fontaine acted her part to was at the same time cunning calculating innocent looking frightened and charming it takes an actress with extraordinary talent to pull that off joan fontaine looked absolutely gorgeous in the elegant costumes by travis banton also in the film is mother lillian fontaine as lady flora i highly recommend this film
this movie pleasantly surprised me it has a touching slightly off-center approach that never loses your attention this is a movie i never heard about but if you want a sleeper this is it great writing production and acting i highly recommend it for audiences who want something thoughtful nick nolte sheryl lee and alan arkin are marvelous why wasn't more made of this movie
if dick tracy was in black and white the pope wouldn't be religious giving a new sense to the concept of color in a movie we are offered an unique experience throughout a comic-strip world and one of the few movies which succeeded in doing so thanks to a serious script good direction great performances pacino is astonishing and most importantly a powerful mix of cinematography art direction and costume design using only primary colors the experience is quite different from anything we have seen before and there is also a quite successful hommage to all the gangster-movie genre pratically extinct from modern cinema overall i see this movie as a fresh attempt and a touch of originality to a cinema which relies more and more on the old and already-seen formulas out of
the story deals about jet li who has to fight against his there is one problem the friends are superfighters the film is filled with blood super action and the best stunts forever and lau ching-wan is a great co-actor of course the movie has the typical i love it in germany black mask is uncut
tom and butch cat fight over the capture of jerry mouse because the one who doesn't catch jerry gets kicked out the two cats dress in their clothing to disguise themselves and lets the other have it confused tom and butch whack their rear and all three of them get kicked out
apart from the usual stereotypes of the thirties eugene pallette as the gruff police detective jack la rue as the swarthy italian and of course james lee as the chinese cook this film is the great mystery of a murder in a locked room for an early film this step by step peeling of the veneer of the mystery is similar to the columbo series except in this film you don't have the advantage of knowing who the killer was in advance
although john hard boiled is my number favorite movie but i have to say police story is my number favorite movie i say this because the stunts the fights and the action my favorite part of the movie is when jackie chan jumps off the rail at the top of the esculator at the mall grabs on to a pole surrounded with chrismas lights and slid down the pole fell through a skylight and finally land on his back on the hard marble floor ouch buy it at for something in new line home video any questions or comments please feel free to reply only but i know where you can find any movie ever made if you looking everywhere for a movie and can't find it please reply to me thank you and good night
i was entranced by this touching and hilarious film not to mention surprised i was also surprised to find that the voice of paulie was performed by jay mohr the performance was so finely nuanced neither wavering into schmaltz nor becoming too hard under the new jersey swagger that i thought that this must be some unsung old pro not the baby-faced mr mohr a very impressive performance indeed and gratifying to see his talents being taken seriously in a string of quirky indie films
this is a rip-roaring british comedy movie and one that i could watch over and over again without growing tired peter ustinov has never performed in a bad role and this is no exception particularly with his dry wit but very clever master plan karl malden has always been an admirer of mine since he starred in streets of san francisco i believe that maggie smith is the real star of this film though appearing to be so inept at everything she tries to do but in truth is so switched on particularly at the end when she informs everyone that she has invested so much money that she has discovered whilst laundering his clothes one thing does concern me though could someone please tell me why i cannot purchase this on either dvd or vhs format in the uk could someone please assist
i saw this picture in for and i would like to secure a dvd in the film was the greatest adventure of the time all still an entertainment marvel and get a sense of real bonded friendship in the chemistry between the actors and the performances of sam jaffe eduardo cianelli are outstanding could not be done today i particularly liked the ending where the colonel recites the end of poem over the body of gunga din and tells the untouchable you're a better man than i am gunga don't make movies of this character only cast member that is still alive today is joan fontaine
i loved october sky the thing i loved most had to be the music it worked two ways in the first hour of the film it gives the viewer a time-frame this is done by playing songs from the late fifties in the second hour an instrumental score takes over the music now fits the mood of the film did not only enjoy the music i also quite enjoyed the cast jake gyllenhaal as homer hickam was especially a surprise for me he gave off a first-class performance as did chris owen and chris cooper seen this movie about escaping the life already laid out for you twice now and both times i thoroughly enjoyed myself
i have to say that higher learning is one of the top movies i have ever watched it has a brilliant cast and an equally brilliant director singleton shows how life in university can be there are main story lines the skinheads the african-americans and the homosexuals i was intrigued by all of the stories but the one that got to me the most was the storyline about kristen battling her feelings towards another girl the end was great after seeing the movie times plus i still cry i would have given this movie an but i have to settlefor
even without speaking a word billy connely is wonderful as a zombie carrie ann moss as mom even better zombie girlfriends father thied to eat me i never tried to eat timmy i thought dawn of the dead was good kinda like airplane meets night of the living dead sponsored by don't forget my head fido in an aloha shirt is just way yes the social comment is just too much to even begin to comment on it to say it all really works
in a series chock-full of brilliant episodes this one stands out as one of my very favorites not the most profound episode no great meaning or message but a lot of fun and there are some fine what makes it really stand out for me is that it is to my knowledge the twilight zone episode with a snapper ending the zone is rightly famous for providing a big surprise at the end of a story but this time you get a surprise and think that but it turns out surprise waiting i just like that so much that this is probably one of my two favorite episodes other being a deeper more message-oriented one
an nightmare was an incredibly interesting well-made film i loved the way it just throws you into the main subconscious without coddling the acting was top notch honestly i would watch dominic monaghan read the phone book but everyone else especially the young girl was great as well i was very impressed by the look of the film too usually independent films have a grainy i-shot-this-on-my-camcorder look to them but this director knows what doing the lighting the work i'm looking forward to a feature-length work from tess nanavati
i love this movie it is one of those movies that you can watch time and time again and still find engaging congratulations i believe everyone involved in making the movie and the script should be proud of themselves it is so eerie you feel like you are watching a real life band i would like to see more movies like this i am glad that they did not choose famous hollywood stars to be in this movie because it probably would not have worked and even if billy connolly is quite well known he really got stuck into the role and i could not imagine anybody else playing it congratulations again i really believe this movie deserves the peter sellers comedy award for bill nighy and when you get to the final scene well what can i say
this movie needs to be put on dvd it was so funny and i loved it really really cute and funny not realistic but not suppose to be the only thing i did not like about it was the girl relying on the guy too much it represents the time period way of thinking though i have been trying to get this movie for so long and it has been unavailable for us format only in the uk and will not play on us dvd players it is sadly an over looked classic film believe it or not but this film could easily become a cult favorite for all ages too bad we do not legalize certain things that could really save small countries or our own lindy is unsinkable a positive character that makes lemonade out of lemons she is funny and charming she stole the show
david new short is a very lynchian piece full of darkness tension silences discreet but very textured background music and features again two beautiful actresses a blonde and a brunette a recurrent theme in his characters create a very intriguing slave-mistress relationship that could be seen as a direct follow up to the same kind of relationship featured in mulholland for lynch
this movie i've loved since i was young its excellent although it may be a bit much for the average movie watcher if one can't interpret certain subtleties in the film example our name is achilles and in the final battle between him and alexander shot in the heel with a rocket just as achilles in mythology was shot in his heel a just a little fact that is kind of amusing anyway great movie good story it'd be neat to see it redone with special effects oddly enough gary graham had average success starring in the show alien nation this movie is a fun watch and should be more appreciated
a good show and i find it funny finally the bad latin stereo types are over señor lopez i love this show and i just started watching it about three months ago the whole concept about a latin family tv show really amazed me i am surprised that finally latinos have a good shot to be on tv this show is probably one the best i've seen funny heartwarming touchy and nice
methinks the best screen version of quo vadis ever made well yeah the plot is not so strong and evident as in the book sometimes meandering and loosing its suspense among aesthetic subtleties but the film is really and beautifully strange has an enigma and style that other versions with and the new one from poland definitely lack it has the air of roman decadence the beauty of declining paganism and infant christianity at least i believe it has brandauer forrest and syudov did excellent job in portraying their characters petronius seems to be the biggest success of the cast alone brandauer who is the one of the greatest actors ever and accumulates the very essence of this dying world it that is the way it happened guys imho
saw this on cable back in the early and loved it never saw it again until it showed up on cable again recently still find it a great vietnam movie not sure why its not higher rated i found everything about this film compelling as a vet from vietnam i can relate to the situations brought by both harris and de niro i can only imagine this film being more poignant now with our situation in iraq i wish this would be offered on cable more often for people to see the human toll on our soldiers isn't left on the battlefield its brought home for the rest of there lives and this film is one of many that brings that home in a very hard way excellent film
this incredibly formulaic flick from the walker texas ranger squad contains some of the most unbelievable scenes ever witnessed within a tv movie in addition one can pretty much predict the outcome from the get-go however a fun little movie that gets the job done it entertains all it was meant to do and it does so the stunts and explosions are fun and exciting and the plot isn't half bad the acting is also decent which isn't much of a surprise because everyone knows that chuck norris is no steven seagal if you're a fan of the genre of walker texas ranger you will definitely love this if not then don't waste your time
this was a great movie but it had the worst ending i think i have ever seen the actors were great and displayed wonderful talent the entire story was twisted and unexpecting which is what made it entertaining as good as the movie was the entire film is judged by the ending which was terrible maybe a sequel could eliminate this bad ending
this is a lovely spirit-restoring movie from the use of the actual villa that inspired elizabeth arngrim to write the novel in the to the inspired casting every choice was perfectly right the quiet joy of this film doesn't stale after repeated viewings josie lawrence miranda richardson polly walker and joan plowright seem to have been born to play these parts i would dearly love to see enchanted april released on dvd in a widescreen format
right at this moment i am watching this movie for the second time television and for the second time i fell into it when it was running for an hour already think i saw minutes more this time this movie is really impressing the way goldsworthy looks at nature changes nature in a way that you yourself would never think of really is amazing this whole movie gives you a warm feeling seeing him play with the world around him with such love or only seeing his hands covered in dirt and with broken fingernails it just touches you
it is so gratifying to see one great piece of art converted into another without distortion or contrivance i had no guess as to how such an extraordinary piece of literature could be recreated as a film worth seeing if you loved book you would be understandably afraid of seeing some misguided interpretation done more for the sake of an art-film project than for actually bringing the deeper meaning to the screen there are a couple examples of this with the master and margarita as complex and far-fetched as the story is the movie leaves out nothing it is as if the filmmaker read work the same way an orchestral conductor reads a not a note missed why can't we find such talent here in the so now my favorite book and movie have the same title
a drifter looking for a job is mistaken for a hit man in a small wyoming town leading to all kinds of complications cage is perfectly cast as the unlucky schmuck hoping to make a quick buck and get out of town but finding he can't escape the title town hopper does what he does best playing a psycho known as lyle from dallas the real hit man walsh as a crooked sheriff and boyle as a femme fatale round out the fine cast the script by brothers john and rick dahl contains delicious twists and turns and direction creates a terrific neo noir atmosphere witty and very entertaining it sucks the viewer in from the start and never lets up
really liked this film one of those rare films that hollywood really does not make anymore william h macy is just great as the hit man with a soul and neve campbell is just flat out fantastic as the woman who puts his life on the track of you have a chance see this film it earns praise
fatal error is a really cool movie robert wagner antonio sabato jr janine turner jason schombing malcolm stewart and david lewis are in the film the cast all acted really well robert wagner played his role good the relationship between saboto jr and turner was a nice one there maybe a big age difference there but they are a unique couple the two actors really worked together rather well the music in the film is really good by ron ramin and fits the flick very well there is a bunch of stuff that happens in the movie which you don't know what is going on and what is going to happen next and this movie keeps you going from beginning to end if you like robert wagner antonio sabato jr and janine turner then watch this excellent movie
i have seen this wonderful production and i wonder if anyone can tell me anything about the actress who played the wife-i am not sure of her name i went to byu with her and lost touch with her-her maiden name was kim luke-and i wonder if anyone has any info on her she is not listed in the credits this production was outstanding a tear-jerker on all accounts superb acting by all i guess i don't even want to put it in the general category of acting more like portraying with feeling the amazing events that led to the opening of the heavens for this the final like that if anyone worked with kim or has a website or something please let me know she was fantastic in her role by the melissa thorne
all dogs go to heaven plays on the canine criminal underworld the film is a delight for children with a comical and dark-but-satisfying and happy-ending storyline with plenty of song and dance it features outcast charlie a fellow canine criminal who is murdered but returns from the dead he meets a homeless human girl who looks up to him and through this relationship he realizes the meaning of life and self-sacrifice this is a cute animation loved very much through my eyes as a child i would highly recommend this film to children i'm unsure about how adults would react to it tried to watch it a few years ago on vhs but those recordings don't last long do they
if you want mindless action hot chicks and a post-apocalyptic view of seattle then this is the show for concept of dark angel isn't anything new fact controversy over whether james cameron stole the idea from a book but i spend the entire hour watching it every tuesday from start to alba is smoking and max friends cindy kendra are just as hot fight scenes are getting better but the dialogues between original cindy and max need to be a little bit better slang sounds forced and it sounds like someone living in the suburbs wrote my opinion dark angel is a great guilty pleasure filled with everything an action fan could ask for but if you're looking for hard hitting award-winning drama go watch the west wing or something
my family and i have viewed this movie often over the years it is clean wholesome heartbreaking and heartwarming showing us the compassion between two families of two countries thousands of miles apart and by the most uncanny of coincidences almost as if the hand of god had to be yo jodelle micah ferland who plays desi the heart stricken little girl does a magnificent job of acting her part and for me she was the priam choice for the lead in all a out of there are no downsides to this sweet human story children of all ages will tearfully then joyfully watch this and it will bring the viewing family together with smiles and good feelings
this movie is probably my favorite movie of all time miriam flynn is excellent as bunny packard zane buzby as delores is comic genius the rest of the cast is amazing and the film is really really funny a definite satire of horror films with a zany twist if you enjoy a fun comedy filled evening then go and rent this classic you'll laugh all the way through
i saw this movie first on the berlin film festival and i had never seen hong kong cinema before i felt like sitting in a roller coaster the action was so quick and there wasn't one boring moment throughout the film it has martial arts love special effects and a fantastic plot my favorite scene is when the taoist drinks sings and fights for himself one of the many scenes which stress the extraordinary musical component of the movie this film is a definite must
very funny film classic film funny eddie murphy of the i saw when i was a child and i have a good memory the classic irony of murphy does not fail the film is funny well done murphy in made many films of action that represented for him a way to joke about everything that is dangerous the result can only be appreciated by some but ii film from up to now have changed the atmosphere for a movie of that time is good and the special effects are good for a film of the period a nice movie to see and enjoy appreciating the taste of ironic murphy an actor who has recently disappeared the final part is anthologies the likable actor who plays the part of the tibetan monk it
i loved this episode it is so great that all of them team up and stop luthercorp and save the world i also love this episode because kyle gallner and justin hartley arrow are guest starring in it i just hope that clark will join the justice league and we'll get to follow this group of heroes across the globe was really exciting and keeps viewers interested because of what will happen next i think chloe should also join the team as watchtower that would be such a coool thing for her to do besides the daily planet because she doesn't have super powers also i want to find out what types of subjects lex is going to use for i wonder what other types of powers other people in the world have
having seen both fear of a black hat and this is spinal tap i can honestly state that while similar both movies are truly must see there will be many times in fear that will have you in hysterics it is no wonder why both movies have such a huge cult following fear will soon be available on dvd rent it if you must but the only way to fully enjoy this movie is to have it for yourself
when i started to watch this movie on i cringed the mtv movies were all bad so i wasnt expecting much but this movie was really good i liked it a lot and it even had a twist at the end see this movie because it shows that made for tv movies that are good exist
i could not take my eyes off this movie when it showed up on cable the dialogue and costumes are of a quality most readily associated with soft-core porn in this case the expedient plot serves as a vehicle not for sex but for serial thrashings with nunchuks for sex as well but not on indian tv being a fan of the genre i couldn't place jeff wincott and had no leads to search from only once brigitte nielsen traded in her futuristic-nurse coif mayoral for the high-top fade we remember from beverly hills cop ii did i make the positive id on movie will no doubt entertain any admirer of early couture or nod-and-wink schlock à la paul verhoeven can we add a genre tag for
this is one of the best hong kong films around and it has a tense and exciting storyline as well as great fight scenes this sammo film has it all romance drama excitement and a great hero as well it is the only martial arts film that got me interested in the plot rather than just waiting for the fights sammo this is a must see also eastern condors shanghai express biao is ace dragons forever and enter the fat dragon
the unborn is a very very different film james karen brooke adams are in the film and they performed quite well this film is builds up solidly and it keeps you going though i think you must be a horror fan to watch this because of the scenes and the plot there is one brief sex scene with no nudity that could have been left out and to some people this scene may disappoint someone like me into the film and thinks that stuff ruins a good film but it when it comes to that there is a scene where adams character goes nuts and kills a cat but you can tell its not real the music is very different but very good the unborn in my opinion is a really creepy film superbly unpredictable and quite strange i recommend all horror fans to this movie
my wife and i have watched this whole series at least three times i can't imagine how it could be better this isn't the complete history of library could hold such a it is the best summary of that history lots of detail lots of personal stories and still keeps the overall picture in narration is excellently written and of course superbly given the interviews are from all sides except the russian because the producers were not allowed to talk to many russians it is very much worth owning this complete program on dvd we treasure our do an excellent job of providing pictures and action where there was almost none extant in any archive there are almost no films of convoys and submarine battles for instance but still the episode on this subject is very well done
i don't understand not being a critic i am not evaluating the quality of the acting which i find believable a good thing my confusion lies with the content is no one else sensitive to the fact that these two unfaithful women were justifying their infidelity to men who were fighting and bleeding to guarantee the continued freedom of their families and their country should there not have been a prologue informing us if the men made it home and if so what effect their cheating wives infidelity had on them while these women were bedding their paramours out of a sense loneliness did they think that their husbands were enjoying being shot at while facing death or dismemberment daily they didn't think of their husbands at all only of themselves pardon me except when they wished their husbands dead
this series something different sometimes european series are less accurate than the usa ones but this time authors have hit the right target creating a mix that works in a smoothly way edel starck is great it has all great plot smart witty always well delivered lines an amazing theatrical timing showed by all the stars and beautiful shots of berlin one of the most interesting city in the world entertaining to see how things works in the justice field in other countries than the usa and for once feel the old europe way of dealing with life kudos to all the cast and crew for a well done comedy that is going to be a must to see in the years to the series in german is super
i saw it in a posh movie theater where the audience is usually white educated and urban the showing i attended had a sprinkling of african-americans and it made the difference in audience-reaction between the two groups a wonderful social commentary on the state of race relations in this country basically the white folks were afraid to laugh or laughed nervously at the funny bits there are many because they'd be laughting at blacks while the blacks also stayed pretty silent because many couldn't laugh at themselves in front of the whites on the other hand being asian thus belonging to neither group had a great time viewing this satire of rap culture and its the cast is talented and does at great job becoming the characters portrayed the songs are too funny to be film is one of the best pseudo-documentaries to come along including a mighty wind
four great stories from master robert bloch adapted to the screen by the best actors in the field in the early seventies are the base of this excellent amicus production this was a kind of movie very popular in the sixties till the mid-seventies and one of my favorite type of horror movies this one in particular shines for the episode sweets to the sweet where christopher lee is stalked by his evil little girl child heiress to her mother tradition great fun from start to finish and good to very good are also the other three episodes the last one a bit on the comic side but with the great addition of ingrid pitt the most famous vampress of the english cinema
after reading the original play i thought it would have been much more difficult to adapt to screen than it turned out to be donal mccann puts in a once-off great performance as public gar the repressed antagonist who is manifested openly on screen by his extroverted unseen to others private gar eamonn kelly also plays an excellent screwballs whose inability to communicate his feelings is matched only by worth renting out if you can find it unavailable outside ireland uk
this is a great british film a cleverly observed script with many quotable lines which captures perfectly what magic mushrooms can do to a man over a weekend as per usual phil daniels is excellent along with that most under rated of british actors geoff bell peter bowles with a joint hanging out of his mouth is a casting masterstroke and gary stretch with his brooding looks brings something strangely atmospheric to the piece although it seems to be billed as a biker movie i think it will find an audience outside of this purely on the premise that a lot of people have been there done it and got the t-shirt also a great original soundtrack with a blinding version of freebird this really could be a century heir to the famous ealing comedies like the weed in the welsh fields a grower
john deliverance concerns four suburban atlanta dwellers who take a ride down the swift waters of the cahulawassee the river is about to disappear for a dam construction and the flooding of the last untamed stretches of land four friends emphasize different characters a virile sports enthusiast who has never been insured in his life since there is no specific risk in it reynolds a passionate family man and a guitar player cox an overweight bachelor insurance salesman beatty and a quiet thoughtful married man with a son who loves to smoke his pipe follows is the nightmarish explorations against the hostile violence of nature it is also an ideal code of moral principle about civilized men falling prey to the dark laws of the wilderness shot this thrilling adult adventure certainly contains some genuinely gripping scenes
this movie is one exception of the rule that a sequel is worser than the original its comedy at its best this movie is a fast action slapstick comedy where something seems to happened every second at more than one occasion the entire audience laughed loudly at a a big advantage to have seen the first movie but its not a kanal also have the advantage of being a parody on the latest decades reality production tv series such as survivor robinson in swedish this is a swedish movie for the swedish audience thus don't see it if you aren't familiar with sweden and its language otherwise have fun johan
if you didn't enjoy this movie either your dead or you hate adam sandler or don excellent cast all of who gave good performances this movie proved that adam sandler is good actor despite what critics say adam sandler is becoming a very well respected actor it all started with his performance in big daddy then he did a couple bad movies then he broke through with terrific performance in first dates the longest yard then click and now reign over to the movie adam sandler plays a man who has lost everything the closest thing to family he has are a mother-in-law and father-in-law after his old college roommate ran into him he seems to turn his life around i will say no more because i do not want to ruin the movie but i strongly recommend this movie one of the best movies of
only episodes into a part drama but i can already state that this is one of the best things i've ever seen on tv silver screen or even in real a writer so good almost demoralising as a viewer so entertaining that i'm annoyed the episodes are over a fortnight instead of monday to friday clear that all these negatives are actually a modern guy who previously turned over from tv dramas in comparison to movies tv dramas always seemed to be dated quite tame and well generally boring five days has really brought tv drama into the century so for me at least mind changing go watch it
teresa pavlinek was a popular member of the toronto second city cast she has done numerous guest spots and commercials up here in canada finally someone has the sense to create a show for her the supporting case seems quite good too i have now watched the pilot several times and i still find it refreshing though i am not sure why the show is listed as the jane show might be wrong but as far as i am aware the show was conceptualized in and appeared on global tv in canada in early it is a fresh idea and hopefully it does well too bad this couldn't be paired up with corner gas now i know corner gas is on ctv but the two shows would be great companion pieces
this movie earned every one of the ten votes i gave it thank you guys for making a movie worth watching you showed the can still write direct produce and star in a black movie without the negative stereotypes the poetry was awesome as well hats off to the poets and watched it last night as i fell in love with my darling all over again i will be adding it to my movie collection today and recommending it to my friends and continue to produce quality don't worry about the you again and best wishes and blesses to you
i loved this movie i knew it would be chocked full of camp and silliness like the original series i found it very heart warming to see adam west burt ward frank gorshin and julie newmar all back together once again anyone who loved the batman series from the should have enjoyed return to the batcave you could tell the actors had a lot of fun making this film especially adam west and i'll bet he would have gladly jumped back into his batman costume had the script required him to do so i told a number of friends about this movie who chose not to view it now they wished they had i have all of the original episodes on vhs now this movie will join my collection thank you for the reunion adam and burt
calling this a romantic comedy is accurate but nowadays misleading the genre has sadly deteriorated into cliches too focused on making the main couple get together and with very little room for ambience and other stories making it formulaic and overly shop around the corner does not suffer from these illnesses it manages to create a recognisably atmosphere and has a strong cast besides the strong nominal leads i avoid using the words supporting cast as for example mr matuschek morgan has a central role to the film and his story is equally if not more important than the film you've got mail borrowed the anonymous pen-pal idea from this film and has therefore been billed as a remake this is not correct and in fact unfair to the new movie it shares the genre and borrows a plot element but that is all
the first of two jim thompson adaptations released in other being the more well-known grifters after dark has all of hallmarks dangerous women the confidence game and characters that are either not as dim as others suspect them of being or not as patric is superb as a former boxer disqualified from the sport for life due to an incident in the ring james foley uses raging bull-esquire sequences to flesh out the back story and the too-little-seen rachel ward also delivers a great performance but bruce dern is the secret weapon his sweet-talking grifter uncle bud subtly commands each of his almost no comic relief in this film so watch it prepared to be sucked into the void
hilarious film i saw this film at the sydney gay and lesbian mardi gras film festival and laughed from start to finish the acting was subtle but very funny i'm not entirely certain about the real world influence we don't get that here but the film holds up without the understanding of that show heather b steals every scene she appears in most notably when acting with her seldom talkative red co-star highly recommended i'd love to see this released on some time in the future
sci-fi thrillers are more like rambo in outer-space with monster special effects ludicrous such as sounds of explosions in the vacuum of space though tame by standards the special effects of forbidden planet were quite striking for their time even today they still hold plausibility yet the best part of the movie is perhaps the reason that radio thrillers still have appeal much of what was going on was left up to the imaginations of the audience did the krell creatures look like by having much of the framework of the story never divulged or only divulged in the end the tension and suspense held throughout the movie the ending was also very thought-provoking and satisfying in my mind this is still one of the best not the best sci-fi films ever made
edmund burke said that all evil needs is for good me to do nothing hollywood often gives us trash because not enough families go to see quality films this movie was uplifting story of the loss and restoration of faith it had no violence no lewdness and did not deserve a pg rating the western scenery was filmed well and some of the vistas were simply breathtaking actors were a bit young for their parts but otherwise believable and talented music score was too loud and in some places drowned out the dialog completely i'm seldom surprised by movie endings any more but i was pleasantly surprised by this one sometimes the good guys do win and they win by honest efforts we liked the movie and the message and would recommend it for the entire family
amazing that so many people that i know haven't seen this little gem everybody i have turned on to it have come back with the same reaction what a great never much cared for brad pitt his turns in monkeys and fight club show improvement but his performance in this film as a psycho is unnerving dark and right on else in the film gives excellent performances and the slow and deliberate pacing greatly enhance the proceedings the sense of dread for the characters keeps increasing as they come to realize what has been really only thing that keeps this from a in my book is that compared to what came before it the ending is a bit too long and overblown but the only flaw i could find in this cult you check this film out try to get the letterboxed unrated cut for the best viewing
with stunning cinematography and a thread of kafkaesque absurdity this movie had me from the simple yet fascinating opening scene the movie plays much like a dream and i think that may be why people either hate it or love it characters are drawn superficially and the story itself is slight and perhaps a little pointless but these are failings of the movie but conscious choices the film works isn't trying to work as history but rather is a deconstruction of war movies would have trouble arguing that there was much real substance to the movie but the movie is such a cinematic wonder that i was completely swept away this is one of the most beautifully filmed movies ever and there is a wild imagination in its style i can completely understand why people would hate it but i give it
the barbarians not the best film that anybody of us have seen but so discribe how mutch i laughed when i first saw director really wanted to do a serious adventure movie but misirable bad that one of the funniest movies ever my advise is that you should see if you alredy did se it again
the oscars was a very good one work as emcee was very funny and light i personally loved her last apperance which garnered some frigid reviews due to coarse language and salacious jokes but fine the audience seemed to like it halle berry denzel washington ron howard woody allen and sidney poitier made this an oscar telecast to
this is one of those unfortunate films that suffered an even more sad unfortunate death at the box office i saw this film at a local art revival after it tanked in mainstream cinemas it certainly deserves to be approached a second time even a third sandra b takes it to the limit by doing spoken word taking on some well known songs in this piece version of hank i'm so lonesome i could cry could easily move you to tears maybe someday audiences will be ready to take this film a bit more seriously not without some well placed the film moves at a brisk pace to some nice that some viewers will not find it stale boring perhaps a revival is just down the pipeline
one of the best ensemble acted films i've ever seen there isn't much to the plot but the incredible you see the characters change ever so subtly undr the influence of the rented villa in italy and love and happiness the film casts a mesmerizing spell on you much as the villa does on all the women truly enchanted
a classic hollywood biopic is the best sense of the genre gooding and deniro both give spectacularly heartfelt performances in the two leads roles and the supporting cast is uniformly excellent with standout performances by carl lumbly and michael rapoport only nit i might pick is that role was unnecessary distracting her performance which was fine just that the film seemed to add two unnecessary scenes to accommodate her from that the characterizations dynamics and action of the real-life story are riveting and unforgettable the evolutions of the main characters and how what they experience evolves their beings are uniquely characterized by the performing artists despite the extreme length the pacing stays intact throughout the score is also this a predictable hollywood film you bet so mike leigh addicts should subtract a star but everyone else should enjoy mightily
if you went to this movie to see some huge academy award if you wanted to see a funny delightful adaptation of an old classic you will love carey was incredible as usual the story line was great a few parts added like the history of the grinch made it even better ron howard never misses a although there were a few adult comments and cleavage added this is supped to be a kids or family show try not to lose sight of that if you do you really wont enjoy the as for the comments about ron howard try to direct a major motion picture and see how you not easy as it looks
many mystery stories follow the standard whodunit path murder most foul gathering of clues gaggle of possible perps sprinkling of red herrings and inevitable showdown between clever evildoer and even more clever crime abandons the well-trod and gives us complex characters who may or may not have committed terrible acts the fact that at the end of three episodes we have no easy answers and no neatly-tied package might frustrate some but for me it was the indication of an intelligently crafted tale which probes disturbs and haunts with the question what does an evil person look acting and production combine to make a mystery not easily forgotten
when you actually find a video game to be scary or disturbing you know that the developers have done some very serious and hard work to make the whole thing work undying used the unreal engine but had very little resemblance to that game when it came to actual gameplay speaking of gameplay the pace is slowed down and the sheer difficulty in progressing through the very hard to kill enemies makes for a very unqiue gameplay experience the production values are so high that you may even forget that it is a video game the game itself is also packed with loads of secrets that you have to uncover using special vision the level design in fantastic and the weapons as well as the enemies will really shock you
garde à vue has to be seen a number of times in order to understand the sub-plots it contains if you're not used to french wordy films based upon conversation and battle of wits rather than on action don't even try to watch it you'll only obtain boredom to death and reassured opinion that french movies are not for à vue is a wordy film essentially based upon dialogs by audiard by the it cruelly cuts the veil of does maître martineau prefer to be unduly accused of being a child murderer rather than telling the truth because at the time of the murder he was with a years old girl with which he has a sexual relation his wife knows it jealous of it and he prefers to be executed in france there was still death than unveiling the sole pure and innocent aspect of his pitiful life
being the prototype of the classical errol flynn adventure movie and having a good story as well as two more brilliant co-stars in maureen o'hara an exquisite beauty and anthony quinn i can only recommend this movie to all those having even the slightest liking for romance and at its best
since i am so interested in lake monsters i really dug this movie this movie is worth a see if you like the so awful they are good types of films check it out the effects are really good as well just think land of the lost i originally watched this movie in the early maybe more like on a local channel monster show called morgus presents i didn't scare me but i was and anything b felt more like an a years later i seen it on dvd at a local circuit city and bought it immediately so i can give it a because it has a personal spot in my heart right there with the monster squad and gremlins good b movie fun for all ages
a very good start i was a bit surprised to find the machinery not quite so advanced it should have been cruder to match we saw in the original series the cast is interesting although the vulkan lady comes across as a little too human she needs to school on spock who after all is the model for this race too bad they couldn't have picked jeri ryan i like ms park the the doctor has possibilities haven't sorted out the other males except for the black guy a really likeable bakula needs to find his ql his strong point was his sense of humor and his willingness to try anything he is of course big and strong enough for the heroics the heavies were ok although i didn't like their make-up
i was young film student in when the union of the soviet filmmakers came to sofia bulgaria and premiered siberiade stalker and danelia'a autumn marathon i was stunned by the cosmopolitan dimension of the art form then and only then i saw siberiade and hours epic and was speechless way better then by andron will somehow get to the negative and make restored version full lenght someday on dvd of course also i fiercely fought in defense of this cinema against most of my colleagues who were equating soviet film with bad taste time is on my side

jackie chan name is synonomus to stunts this movie never let you opening best chase scene and last roll down scene from the pole is so risky than one wonder if he knows the meaning of movie comes very close to best which is project the main difference being that project a contains three stars where as in this movie jackie carries the film entirely on his is perhaps the main reason that this movie made jackie an biggest martial arts star followed by bruce film has nice comic touches too what makes this film work is ability to show his venerable side which his in contract to the typical martial arts action movie was followed by a sequel which was good but was quite tame in comparison to its predecessor
all i can say is first movie this season that got my attention i picked it because of the actors gere and claire and the story looked have just watched it and i can say i'm overwhelmed there are shocking scenes what makes it more realistic we shouldn't run away from our reality these things are happening right this moment and there are experts who are trying to change things and make things better and who get laughed out about their commitment to the cause actually i can't seem to feel the hollywood touch in the what makes it better both claire and richard did a great roles and deserve a from me
spin opened up with a clever disney favorite talespin the tv cartoon series that featured characters from the jungle book join baloo and kit cloudkicker as they fly the sea duck like you've never seen it before out of cape suzette to up mountains through jungles on water in volcanoes looking for adventure looking for treasure looking for fun all in one action-packed cartoon was a favorite of mine as well as my this ran on the disney afternoon the entire first half of the until the original cartoons moved to the old disney channel in which i have seen on vacation once in before getting cable in march good news today the dvds are here relive the fun and excitement of dun dun dun
i would give this show a ten out of ten if it was not for the fart jokes you people are so damn sensitive it is inane so quick to point out the racism of the show and the jokes yet are also so quick to say ridiculously sexist pig-headed crap like well duh some of these other shows do these jokes so much better because at least they have hot women so disgusting abortion jokes are great because really who takes abortion seriously anyways at least i'm not i hear that reba mcentire and sarah silverman are teaming up to do a movie about sisters taking a road trip together talk about a movie of the year
this movie was made in but it still rings true today very very funny it begins with a family wanting to buy a little place in the country and it builds from there anyone who has ever built a house will find this movie very endearing great cast cary grant and myrna lloyd are delightful in this film this is a classic black and white film that reflects the grand style of the architecture and family life many references are made to the cost of things and those comparisons to costs are pretty amazing i can't imagine anyone not enjoying this movie completely i am surprised of the number of middle aged people who have never heard of it a true classic
a kind of road movie in old-fashioned trains in the slowenian late summer province at the beginning you see someone in underwear sewing trousers from black cloth and when the same young man in his black trousers leaves the house with two suitcases you see that the trousers-part is missing on a flag of mourning his father has died in the train he meets a young lady and almost without words but many small gestures a wonderful love story begins a somehow surreal very poetic and a little bizarre movie with a lot of strange characters and strange incidents beautiful pictures with love for beautiful details
ulysses as a film should in no way be compared with the novel for they are two entirely different entities however that being said the film still manages to maintain many of the elements that made the book work but since it is a visual medium it is more difficult to pull of stream-of-consciousness i think this is the best film they could have made with the material and this is from someone that routinely rants about films not being like their literary counterparts i recommend the book but the movie is still entertaining
still crazy has been compared to the spinal tap since both are comedies about wash-up groups actually here the similarity ends because still crazy is much better written and acted out whereas spinal tap script deteriorates from the mildly amusing first min into a drivel that makes beavis and butthead to appear sophisticated in comparison still crazy is formulaic but the likability of the characters and the unexpectedly high quality of some musical numbers for me managed to offset the a priori predictability of the movie people who expect spinal tap-like attempt on satire would be disappointed by the light-hearted nature of the movie but i'd take a successful self-ironic romp of still crazy over a pompous but failed shot at satire which is spinal tap
three sergeants in the british army stationed in india are sent out to stop an uprising of a tribe of murderers known as the thuggees one of the sergeants cutter leads away from the camp in search of a golden temple and is captured by the thuggees lead by the sinister guru gunga din the water boy goes back to the camp for help and the other two sergeants go after him but are also captured now the major sends a full detail out after the three but do not realize that they are walking into a trap set by the thugees it is though gunga din who saves the day excellently made buddy film even though it is today politically incorrect grant mclaglen and fairbanks do give very humorous and thrilling performances with jaffe very well in the title role and cianelli very sinister as guru out of
this is one of my favourite kung-fu films and is regarded as one the most popular shaw brothers from the late the plot is interesting and twisty the characters are cool each with their own style toad snake lizard etc the action is limited in comparison with other chang cheh venoms films but what is there is interesting with different kung-fu styles on display from the various characters i recommend this film to those who think all shaw brothers especially chang films are the same most of his films usually focus on the tigers and shaolin vs manchu conflicts this film is breath of fresh air in comparison
this movie just goes to show that you dont need big dollar computer highly over paid actors and actresses to make a good movie all you need is a excellent story line and plot which the master of all japanese kurosawa pulls off brilliantly i recommend this film to all that love a epic period piece and for those that enjoy kurosawas earlier works
this film and sequel barry mckenzie holds his own are the two greatest comedies to ever be produced a great story a young aussie bloke travels to england to claim his inheritance and meets up with his mates who are just as loveable and innocent as he chock a block full of great sayings where else could you find someone who needs a drink so bad that as dry as a dead dingoes donger great characters top acting and got great sheilas and more fosters consumption then any other three films put together top some of the funniest songs you'll ever hear and full of great celebrities definitely my two favourite films of all time i watch them at least once a fortnight

a great funny sweet movie with morgan freeman plays himself and who meets a spanish girl named scarlet vega at a small store whilst researching a potential independent film i was a bit dubious about the film for the first ten minutes but as soon as he was in the store i really started to enjoy the film it shows how a positive attitude can change anything it does not contain any complex plots and it is easy to follow but will lift the saddest of moods and make you smile all the way through without the need for petty cliché romance it includes several scenes all the way through which make you clutch your sides with laughter a very rare masterpiece
i missed the entire season of the show and started watching it on abc website during the summer of i am absolutely crazy about the show i think the entire cast is excellent one of my favorite show ever i just checked the abc program lineup for this fall and did not see it on the schedule that is really sad i hope they will bring it back maybe they are waiting until bridget moynahan has her baby or is it only my wishful thinking read some of the comments posted about the show and see so many glowing remarks similar to mine i certainly hope that abc will reconsider its decision or hopefully another station will pick it up
god i love this movie if you grew up in the and love heavy metal this is the movie for you they really don't get much better than this the fastway soundtrack is one of the best soundtracks ever i put on the record when it first came out and spent the next month learning every song on guitar note for note the plot outline is your standard heavy metal horror movie favorite singer dies kid plays record backwards hero comes back in demonic form and rocks the town what more could you ask you haven't seen it yet rush out and buy it you will not be disappointed metal rules

considering the big name cast and lavish production i expected a lot more of this film the acting for the most part is great although the story they have to work with is mediocre at best however the film still warrants watching because of the acting and the stars and some and up and coming young talent
reese first movie loved it the plot and the acting was top notch you are emotionally involved with the characters in my opinion a must watching this movie you will see why reese acting career has been so successful other cast members do a great job also movie flows extremely well there is not a boring moment in the whole picture the man in the length is just right i said earlier i think this movie was excellent i have seen it numerous times and have enjoyed every one of the viewings
this movie does a great job of explaining the problems that we faced and the fears that we had before we put man into space as a history of space flight it is still used today in classrooms that can get one of the rare prints of it disney has shown it on vault disney and i wish they would do so again
this movie pretty much surprised me i didn't have very high expectations for it but i was wrong mary rhoda was very funny and well written they didn't spend too much time rehashing the past so they weren't relying on the success of the old tv show to carry the movie overall it was very girlfriend commented that this could be a weekly sit-com and i think i might agree with her
colorful cowboy james stewart moseys on up to the yukon territory to dig for gold sell his steers and try to get a date with pretty saloon-owner ruth roman if he can shake the tail of crooked sheriff john mcintire who wants cattle beautiful cinematography in a collaborative effort by william fritzsche and bill daniels good technicolor adventure from universal-international directed by anthony starring corinne calvet connie gilchrist and walter brennan as sidekick
i just watched this movie by mistake what a little gem this film made in looks and feels like a late seventies movie and is in fact better more restrained and correct than say blue soldier the environmental anthropological undertones are way ahead of its time the understated cinematography is superb and terribly realistic much more than dances with wolves the last hunt manages to convey the look and feel of the buffalo killing fields of the late probably because those in the movie were real killing fields the movie was shot during legal forestry directed buffalo culls so the animals you see are really being shot the bones are real in conclusion a very under-rated western masterpiece superbly acted directed and shot
blade runner is a replicant of lost children senses or whatever used and abused and mostly well just giving us far less than what we might dream of city really ought to be a while now i've been waiting for an animated film that might affect me as much as stuff has this one is the scratch the animated part of have an intense love-hate relationship with film noir and hey if you don't leave it must be mostly love right but there are so many sci-fi and noir themes totally submerged in this film that just a wonder to people did an incredible job
this movie was made me laugh it make a bawl and most of all it has talking animals in it this movie should be seen by all kinds of people it is one of my favorite movies and i just love it so much that i just had to comment on rox it is so heart felt and a wonderful storyline that makes up a great and heartfelt favorite character is shadow this is because i think that he is the most interesting and charming i used to have a golden retriever just like shadow i miss him so much he was my best friend and i knew that when he died he would be in a happier place but i miss him with all of my heart this movie is the best i love it and everyone should love your pets no matter what they do cherish them forever
not since spongebob squarepants have i seen a greater cartoon on tv the colors are great the voices could't be better the characters are so original great great cartoon hope nickolodean continues to develop this cartoon hope the season dvd comes out soon i love cartoons like this and i hope more people tune in to se this great cartoon it is very hard to find the season dvd so if somebody finds a store that is selling it please let me know the only catscratch merchandise available on nick shop is a great lookin shirt but very very very expensive if you love spongebob and who doesn''t you'll love catscratch too
rod serling was of course a genius and his wonderful playful creative mind left something of the period in which he lived and examples of television at that state of development there are no such shows now but rather housewife sluts ala eva longoria or terri hatcher or the pitiful stabs at humor and witty banter that litter our high-tech elam edged into the episode with such acting precision and with his usual craziness that i can't help but think that rod serling was tailoring that long ago show around elam even though he was an ancillary to the flow of the story this episode ends with a twist as usual but shock and humor are mixed with especially serlingesque lewis field
i watched this movie with my mother when i was in high school many years ago i definitely was not the least bit interested in opera at the time but he changed my views i enjoyed this movie very much and have truly enjoyed opera ever since i even bought several of his who cares what his acting abilities were he basically just played himself which was adorable he was so charming so charismatic i honestly just wanted to hug him i feel very sad that so many are criticizing him so harshly it was so straight did not accept people pushing him around or judging him for his actions he deserves to be respected and admired for his talent he will definitely be missed
its too bad that no one knows anything about this movie and it gets old telling people version of spinal tap and you know im sorry i dont have any better comments but damnit go get the movie and watch it and then make all your friends watch it too just like im gonna
i have found this movie available for streaming on netflix and thought i'd give it a plot revolves around ryan and theo taylor feore and david cubitt who have finally seen each other after their father has passed away ryan and theo at first argue about who did what but later theo finds out that his brother ryan is not only gay but he is dying of a terminal illness so ryan and theo spend their time patching up their is such an incredible film i have only seen colm feore in season of but he was phenomenal in this david cubitt an actor i have never heard of before did a phenomenal job as would recommend this to those who are interested in the gay and lesbian genre this is one movie you don't want to give this film stars out of excellent film
the color purple is a masterpiece it displays the amazing acting abilities of whoopi goldberg oprah winfrey and danny glover not only is steven spielberg the most incredible director of all time but his versatility shines through in this film if you ever want to see what a movie can do watch this a beautiful portrayal of one of the most moving stories of all time
im really addicted to caprica because a really good prequel series to battlestar galactica it really has a slow pace start but surely to pick up soon after new episodes continue to have heard great things about future episodes and guest stars for the first sci fi drama is sure to please us fans who love a mix of both stoltz does an amazing job as well as polly walker as clarice worth checking caprica on fridays at central on syfy
i read the book and saw the movie both excellent the movie is diamond among coals during this era liebman and selby dominate the screen and communicate the intensity of their characters without flaw this film should have made them stars shame on the studio for not putting everything they had behind this film it could have easily been a franchise release on dvd is a must and a worthy remake would revive this film look for it in your tv guide and if you see it listed no matter how late watch it you won't be disappointed do yourself another favor read the book title it'll blow you away times have changed dramatically since those days or at least we like to think they have
hello i just watched this movie earlier today for the time in days i am a history teacher that has wayyyyy too much time on my hands i need a life i found the movie containing a striking resemblance to broke back mountain i also found that i look a lot like jean lafitte if he were white also my favorite line in the entire movie was from mr baby can shoot a eye from yards oh and my favorite scene in the movie was when the british were coming in and the one drummer who was so devoted to his work and he drummed till the death as if that drum would end the war it wouldn't well thats all i would like to say about this movie oh one more brown is an insane physco bipolar mood swinging beeyotch that is all
the first was good and original i was a not bad movie so i heard a second one was made and i had to watch really makes this movie work is judd character and the sometimes clever script a pretty good script for a person who wrote the final destination films and the direction was okay sometimes scenes where it looks like it was filmed using a home video camera with a made-for-tv movie it was worth the rental and probably worth buying just to get that nice eerie feeling and watch judd stanley doing what he does suggest newcomers to watch the first one before watching the sequel just so you'll have an idea what stanley is like and get a little history background
there is no relation at all between fortier and profiler but the fact that both are police series about violent crimes profiler looks crispy fortier looks classic profiler plots are quite simple plot are far more complicated fortier looks more like prime suspect if we have to spot similarities the main character is weak and weirdo but have clairvoyance people like to compare to judge to evaluate how about just enjoying funny thing too people writing fortier looks american but on the other hand arguing they prefer american series maybe the language or the spirit but i think this series is more english than american by the way the actors are really good and funny the acting is not superficial at all
bo beauty and john revolutionary direction make this film worthwhile looking more gorgeous than ever is a recently widowed woman who is experiencing visitations from her dead husband quinn he has a plan bo must procure the body of a young man so that her ghost of a husband can make his transformation from spectre back to corporeal life can she find a fitting candidate how will she do him in so tony can do his thing attributes unique direction film presence and thanks to john a very pretty exotic look to the entire film this movie is pleasant viewing
i've been looking for the name of this film for years i was when i believe it was aired on tv in all i can remember was it was about a teenaged girl alone having survived a plane crash and surviving the amazon i remember people were looking for and that she knew how to take care of narrates the story and i vividly remember about her knowing that bugs were under her skin i don't remember much else about this movie and want to see it this is the same if any of you have a copy could you email me at i'd be curious to attain a copy to see if it is in fact the same film i remember it was aired on in and i was going through problems of my own and this film really impacted heavily on me thanks in advance
marlene gorris has established herself as one of the great directors this sensitive visually beautiful film is based on a story by vladimir nabokov and captures well that dark irony john turturro gives what i consider to be his finest performance am usually not a fan of his and emily watson is brilliant as well well worth seeing
well it definitely is unlike anything else directed by lynch no supernatural stuff no violence no profanity nevertheless it is a beautiful flick a little slow but perhaps that was intentional because the story of an old my best guess for its duration journey the characters are everyday people and thus they are believable the performances are good and the final scene was incredibly touching everyone who has a sibling can relate to it lyle and alvin don't even have to say anything for a moment they are back in the old days and all the fighting is forgotten
very simple to qualify that movie a pure masterpiece this opinion is formulated for the following reasons the performance of the actors they seem to be citizens of that epoch they personalize perfectly the characters a second reason is that the poetry expressed by homere in his poem is well given by the production among others the narrations made by the chorus give a particular atmosphere that makes us party of the artistic rendition third reason the reconstitution of the decor is absolutely perfect in mediterranean regions where the action of the poem occurred and most of all the emotion is on the rendezvous i repeat my appreciation a pure masterpiece
by saying mean that this is not a well made movie but a very good version of the real event and the best depiction so if you are a buff then this is a treat for there are three out of four saboteur members playing roles in this movie theater acting at best but then this is still as said before a semi personally am a die hard fan of our nearly over-human heroes of the second world there should be hundreds of these movies showing us what they did so it won't get forgotten by next nowadays kids doesn't read watch if you want a action private is the truth about lingering endurance and the will to fight when all seems lost
i never saw it on tv but rented the dvd through netflix as soon as i found that it was available i had high expectations and was not disappointed funny and the animation is excellent that level of quality i would only have expected from feature films so i'm surprised at some of the bad comments on it maybe the dvd release had improved animation one bonus to the dvd is that it was fun to see both versions of the pilot i'm an adult and i really appreciate that it is for adults it isn't only kids who like cute animated characters it is nowhere near raunchy as some have claimed but i can see where some parents wouldn't want their young children to see it i'm very disappointed that it was cancelled i wish they would produce more episodes or perhaps a movie
this is a great small film i say small because it doesn't have a hundred guns firing or a dozen explosions as in a john woo film great performances by roy scheider and the three bad guys john frankenheimer seems to have more luck with small productions these days the film is very easy to watch the story is more of a yarn than a washing of everything going around and around it seems as though things just get worse as the plot thickens wonderful ending very positive i never read the elmore leonard book but it can't be much different from the film because it feels like i'm watching an elmore leonard movie
i've always knew anne desalvo was a great character actor now i know she is a great also i have been a fan since i first saw her in the movies perfect my favorite year dc cab and stardust so rare to see lee grant these days in anything she has been missing from the screen for far too long also wonderful to see cloris leachman in something other than a sit-com this is her best work since the last picture show if you grew up in an italian american family you will love this movie i wasn't expecting a lot when i started watching this movie so i was pleasantly surprised when i fell in love with this movie if you get the chance watch it
i must say this movie has given me a dual personality i've been told again and again to shut up and start speaking like a normal person but very hard no not the wang did you find that disgusting and disrespectful well get in the mood for a lot more this movie is just filthy not a film to show your grand-parents but you should show it to a teenager or some immature guy at your workplace anyway back to the voice mannerisms fortunately this site has some ladies man anyone at the studio notice that supposed to be a between the e and s so you can always have a fine little something to say to your boss or the cops i have a sheet in my wallet
i can not quite understand why any of the reviewers gave this documentary other than for political reasons no the film did not investigate both sides of the story but then surely one film in favour of chavez against the tides of propaganda against him should be seen as an attempt to balance out the narrative overall given a the history of cia involvement in latin america in fermenting civil unrest google national security archive and b the coverage in that country and elsewhere of the clearly faked scenes of chavez supporters shooting non-existent opponents what is most amazing about this film is the fact that the film makers stayed in the presidential palace all of the way though the coup surely a first in documentary making images of a coup from both sides
i have seen this film many times and i like all bad teachers want to give it ten out of ten but feel that it would be unfair to other good films however i do think that this is one of those rare gems a perfect comedy it is i would venture one of the greatest comic films of all times matthau and lemmon are perfectly matched and mismatched the script is so sharp that you need to staunch the bleeding the story is well known and has already been described in other comments the two leads give extraordinary performances the girls are superb and the situations are side-splittingly funny not one swear-word in sight that hollywood you don't have to swear to be funny you have to be witty and the move from stage to film is seamless they don't make'em like this any more timeless
i saw this film english title is singing over there at the montreal international film festival it won raves then and disappeared a terrible shame it is brilliant sublime ridiculous sad and extremely funny the script is a work of art been years and i've seen only a handful of comedies any other genre for that matter that can match its originality
i have a two year old son who suffers from the same condition as jonny kennedy i never got the chance to meet him but i have never heard anybody say a bad word about him i hope he knows how much the making of this programme has helped his fellow sufferers by raising awareness of this terrible condition this man has touched people in a way that a million charity leaflets could not i believe that this should be compulsory viewing in schools i also agree with other comments what have i got to moan about he took everything that life could throw at him and still managed to retain a sense of humour god bless i couldn't watch the part that showed his dressings being changed i have enough trouble with my
arms and the man is one of funniest plays if handled correctly and this production does a good enough job helena bonham-carter pre-film stardom is raina the daughter of a military family who has a peacock of a fiancé ryecart and who shelters a soldier from the enemy torrens during a raid on the of colour and energy this production rips along at a good pace and if bonham-carter and patsy kensit as the maid are outshone a bit by the rest of the cast they still hold their ground kika markham and dinsdale landen as the parents are delightful and the whole play is generally a happy recommended
this is hardly a movie at all but rather a real vaudeville show filmed for the most part in proscenium and starring some of the greatest stage stars of the day singing in the bathtub is an absolutely amazing production number that must be be sure to wear your shower cap
well if you are looking for a great mind control movie this is it no movie has had so many gorgeous women under mind control and naked marie forsa as the busty helga is under just about everytime she falls asleep and a few times when she isn't one wishes they made more movies like this one
i saw this film years ago on tnt it was susanah birthday and they were showing this film as a double feature with tom jones i have not seen this film on tv since i took interest in seeing this film because one of the stars is the very funny and talented jim dale as lusty the sailor i believe that dale now does the narration of the harry potter books on casette but anyway he is quite funny this is a fast paced comedy it is not on vhs or dvd columbia pictures should go through their film collection and consider restoring and releasing this film to dvd christopher plummer is hilarious as lord fopington ian bannen is also quite humorous as ramble the sailor this is a bawdy comedy the kind of film one no longer sees with great production values stars out of
only a from me a perfect ten would have been if there was more of a plot to the movie but nevertheless moonwalker to this day remains a fun fest of music dance and entertainment beginning with the montage of video clips from long career it reminds the viewer of just why he is often regarded as the king of pop from his hit i want you back to we are the world the multi-award winning charity record for the benefit of africa following this a short movie of sorts although lacklustre in an oscar winning script nonetheless provides a fantastic and entertaining drama for the audience ending with a perfect rendition of come together something the whole family can watch and enjoy
i have seen the trailer for this movie several times over and i have to say that ned kelly looks like it is going to be a wonderful film when i saw the trailer for the first time i could not take my eyes away from it got my attention for sure heath ledger sticks to what he knows and what works for him period pieces not to mention orlando bloom who is seen for a split second looks fantastic i think that this movie will be a hit and will be seen over and over again my many people
i loved this movie from the opening sequence right through to the end i found the style of directly addressing audience very i found most exciting and refreshing about this movie was its ignoring and thus challenging of gender and class stereotypes the idiosyncrasies of the characters are portrayed as strengths and the absence of judgment and the characters acceptance of themselves and each other enabled me to embrace them and allow myself to be drawn into their world without preaching and with intelligence and gentle and loving humor this movie has the power to open us to new possibilities and offers hope for a world in which people see and accept each other as unique and precious individuals i look forward to more offerings from this creative and talented director
strangler of the swamp was made by low budget studio prc and is certainly one of their best movies i've man who was hanged for a murder he didn't commit returns as a ghost for revenge on the people who accused him he uses a rope to strangle his victims and after several deaths including the old man who operates the ferry across the swamp he disappears the old granddaughter takes over the ferry herself and also falls in love with one of the local men and they decide to get movie has plenty of foggy atmospheres which makes it very creepy cast includes rosemary la planche blake edwards and charles middleton gordon as the of the swamp is a must for old horror fans like myself and a half stars out of
i remember this movie from the when i was in college it is one of the funniest satires of american westerns that i have ever seen i'm only sorry that i have not been able to see it recently and that it is is not out on tape or dvd it is a real treat
i think it is a nice movie i think it is a very romanian movie through scenery and atmoshpere i think it was not intended to be sensual is a result not a purpose i think it is very natural i think it is humane i think it was interesting i think the actors never made me think waw lame acting are not sean connory co neither is the film a block buster they are like the movie normal ppl that can act i think the movie reached its intention i think it made me feel things feel them again i think i'm not really enjoyed it that i know
wow i really liked this movie william h macy is great as the quiet hit-man the performances here are really good the plot is interesting and a married hit-man his a little son is going through a middle age crisis and wants to quit the family business so he goes to the psychiatrist for help and in this place he meets the young free will spirit sarah of whom he falls in love to one day alex doesn't know what to do when he gets a job to kill a person he knows recommend you to watch it if you like mature interesting stars very good
this could be a if it wasn't for the quite predictable and hollywood-ish scenario daniel day-lewis confirms its position as one of the leading actors of our time not the leading may i ask and the rest of the cast stand in a very high level i personally was impressed with hugh o connor who played christy brown as a child the very first scene i watched him was really strong wow
the best modesty blaise movie i have seen so far like a good pilot for a tv-series i even think a little bit cult like with a lite touch of quentin magic or something they have caught a great deal of character but i admit missing willy garwin a bit even if i have read many comics and book by peter o'donnell i'm not disappointed of this film quite the opposite positive surprised of this story about modesty and her childhood i did not put my expectations so high because of the bad movie from so i may have overrate this movie just a little but if you like the comics and other storys about modesty blaise you should definitely see this one can't wait for a follow-up
this is one of those movies that you wish you hadn't seen before so you could see it again for the first time van books still bring pleasure but are termed excessively flowery by many this movie is by far the best film adaptation of his works william powell is william powell say no more the plot is intricate the story moves all too quickly because you want it to last enjoy
this movie is a great attempt towards the revival of traditional indian values which are being replaced by western a joint family story showing all the ethics every person should follow while communicating with every single relative kapoor gives a performance as a desi about to tie knot with amrita rao who is also very desi and she also acts pretty genre of the movie is the same as hahk and such movies deserve to be made in india for the revival of old traditional movies doesn't get as it isn't very good at music which counts a lot in every this it is flawless
say what you want about andy milligan but if his family was even as deranged as the one in this film well then i guess he could have turned out worse unfortunately the video print of this film contains sex scene inserts originally shot by the distributor to boost the box office appeal several times during the film ugly camerawork and silent film music abruptly ends and suddenly good-looking stand-ins for homely actors take over and start doing it to psychedelic guitar rock pretty easy to fast-forward through if you're trying to pay attention to original film which unfortunately is missing quite a bit of action that was cut to make room for the added sex scenes what remains however is still compelling stuff i don't think i've ever seen a more hateful mother in any film before
this film is quite simply brilliant the cinematography is good the acting superb and the story absolutely breathtaking this is the story of donald woods a white south african who thought himself a liberal until he found out the reality of apartheid kevin kline is completely convincing so much so that when donald woods himself appeared on tv some years later i recognised him from portrayal denzel washington also turns in a masterful performance as urge you to watch this it is long but it is worth your patience because it tells such an incredible story remember folks this really happened
the is a well balanced mini series between historical facts and a good plot in four deliveries we follow a north american family with members but we don't only see them we also follow the story of several characters as a black reverend an extremist student leader and a soldier in vietnam the filmography is just extraordinary in the first chapters we see some shots of the vietnam war in between the scenes the next chapter doesn't start where the last one finished it starts some time after giving us a little mystery on what happened in general the mini series is a must see not only for hippies fanatics but for everyone with little curiosity about the topic
imdb lists this as for some reason but the other sources i've seen including the excellent program notes mark it as doesn't really matter except that quite interesting to watch this abstract collage of film and video of the first art works to merge the two apparently in the context of the star gate sequence in released the same year pure abstraction isn't really my thing but i can take it in small doses and the super-saturated optically printed colors and psychedelic feel of this series of flowers rohrschach blots birds etc is pretty compelling and quite beautiful certainly helped paved the way for many other nascent video artists in the and deserves to be better known
i knew i was going to see this when i saw the first preview dennis quaid was one reason but the theme of holding on to your dreams speaks to me people talk about this as a movie for kids but i think a movie for baby boomers who are coming to terms with aging infirm parents our own mortality our kids growing up and leaving us and all the other things we never thought would happen to us movie doesn't fall into the trap of tragedy about what living your dreams means when you have a real life is too small for a pitcher but he makes it look good and rachel griffiths makes a small part as the wife into a thoughtful layered performance the camera-work is slow and sweet when they put this movie together they left out anything that wasn't necessary very nice
evening is an entertaining movie with quite some depth all the actors and actresses turn in spectacular performances with the tremendous cast though one expects stellar acting but in this movie the expectations are exceeded one can relate to personalities and situations in ones own family as one watches the interaction of the family members own family memories are immediately brought to mind this is one of the few movies that inspires one to read the book usually it is the other way around one reads the book and then wants to see the movie i will definitely obtain a copy of the susan minot book and read it the rhode island scenery is spectacular as is the soundtrack any car buff will enjoy the apparently expertly restored period automobiles needless to say now but i recommend evening highly see it you will enjoy it
i saw this at the theater in the early the most memorable and scary scene is when the german army attacks with yellow cross mustard gas for the first time the germans and their horses are covered from head to toe hoof with eerie protective suits the experienced british soldiers don gas masks and once again await the clouds of gas and the german attackers the gas clouds move ever closer finally enveloping the british defenders the germans move forward slowly menacingly in their scary looking garb suddenly a scream from the defenders this gas is like no other that they have experienced before you will know why i have remembered this scene for the last years and still shiver i think that you will too
robert taylor and stewart granger switch the goodie-baddie roles they held in all the brothers were valiant taylor seems a bit uncomfortable in his bad-guy role but granger plays his part perfectly however the real hero in the story are the bison and the northwest the film is perfectly made with the atmosphere of the times wonderfully given the direction is taut and although the film is no light-hearted entertainment it is to my way of thinking a major film unjustly ignored by the cognoscenti
this is an honest attempt to make a bewitchingly sweet love story the obvious inspiration behind the successful tv series bewitched this lovely sweet rom-com is a timeless treasure the comparisons are obvious jimmy stewart plays a hapless but stolid straight kim novac plays a voluptuous blond witch who captures him through the use of a love spell but when that spell is broken by a stronger witch she contents herself with the duties of running her own shop and takes comfort in the fact that her beloved pyewacket feline familiar is being cared for by her beloved aunt you'll recognize the aunt from murder by death this movie is fun and touchingly sweet bearing some spectacular wit and a nice witchy feel worth a look
hollywood north is a satirical look at the time in canadian film history when the canadian government offered huge tax breaks for films made in canada most of the time it was treated as a tax shelter or a cheap way to get american films made for example came out of it anyways matthew modine plays a novice producer who wants to make an adaptation of a beloved canadian novel however in order to get the money he needs a american name star he gets a loose cannon and learns he has to compromise to the point where the film no longer resembles the book it was originally based on it plays well in canada but may not be understood outside of the great white north americans will think we're satirizing ourselves but will miss the point that we're actually satirizing them for canadians for the rest of the world
cary grant douglas fairbanks jr and victor mclaglen are three soldiers in century india who with the help of a water boy jaffe rid the area of the murderous thuggee cult the chemistry between the actors helps make this one of the most entertaining movies of all time sam jaffe is exceptional as the outcast water boy who is mistreated by all and still wants to be accepted as a soldier in the company loosely based on rudyard poem a must see by anyone who enjoys this type of movie
life stinks is a parody of life and death happiness and depression the black and the white always present in our lives mel brooks performance is brilliant as always and the other actors work is fine too this movie has some capra flavor why is so are some unforgettable gags such as the one when brooks tries to earn some money dancing in the street and all the people passing by just ignore him or when he meets a funny crazy man who believes is paul getty and then start arguing and slapping each you seen it you know what movie tells us about the old and eternal struggle of the poor against the rich only difference between this movie and reality is that this movie has a happy ending and reality indeed life stinks
this is superb the acting wonderful sets clothes music but most of all the story am amazed there aren't more reviews of this movie certainly one of the best of the also a wonderful movie to see in tandem with the great random harvest which has much the same opening crisis a middle aged unknown english officer is in a hospital toward the close of the war suffering from shell shock and complete amnesia without any idea of his name origin or anywhere he belongs he proves to be a very wealthy established man when he recovers he will not remember the years before the war there the movies resemblances warmest thanks to all who participated in the movie particularly the actors ian holm alan bates ann margret a great and surprising casting choice glenda jackson julie one stays with you forever
kalifornia is the story of a writer and his girlfriend photographer who are looking for someone to help pay gas money and take turns at the wheel for a cross country road trip to famous murder sights ironically a serial killer and his girlfriend answer the post kalifornia is a diamond in the rough and a very intriguing journey with a serial killer great performances all around by the leads with pitt in particular being exceptional check it out
demonicus rocked you guys need to understand how hard it rocked unfortunately the words needed to explain the extent of the rocking have not been discovered for a tiny idea pop like hits of e watch death factory while on the phone with jesus wait jesus is on call waiting you're having phone sex with will smith on the primary line seriously that movie so good you need to watch it at least a times to catch all the subtleties well not so much subtleties as much as it takes the length of the movie times in order to ponder why the people at full moon are allowed to a live and b reproduce what is our world coming to
welcome to collinwood is one of the most delightful films i have ever seen a superb ensemble cast tight editing and wonderful direction a caper movie that doesn't get bogged down in the standard much can be said about this film without spoiling it the tag line says it all guys safe no h macy and sam rockwell lead an amazing cast george clooney should be congratulated for producing this
seriously i loved this had started to read the book and i loved way everything was set up and everything had a think this film did so well was because louis sachar wrote the of course andrew davis directed lebouf gives a great performance for his first storyline is very cool and humor heart and is very similar to the find this film to be not the least bit absolutely loved i encourage anyone to read the in all this film is very well put together and carefully thumbs up for me in every single way
certainly one of the finest movies i have seen for quite some time exquisite direction and flawless acting make this a very entertaining and often moving film denzel washington plays one of his most engaging and emotional roles to date and the rest of the cast perform beautifully christopher walken is of course superb in his part although he did not appear as often as i would have liked a story of ultimate greed that backfires is offset against a childs innocence and love this is also a film for action movie lovers as it has its fair share of bullets rockets and revenge the location of mexico city adds a feel of seediness and corruption which in itself is an eye opener all in all a truly gripping film from beginning to end highly recommended
after going for a bike ride that day lying beside a lake in a nature reserve spending half an hour feeding and talking to a donkey who lived in a beautiful field with a small wood in it this film made absolute sense to imagery of the film was beautiful and that is all you need switch off the conscious control knob of the mind and job me of baraka but with the added lesson of my previous comment requires a minimum of ten lines ten lines is the minimum not lines but ten after finishing counting all the lines you realise that there are less than ten even though less than ten lines is all that is needed to make my comment
mendez and marichal have provided us with a serious cogent and painful analysis of the social spiritual economic and political crisis that years of colonialism have spawned in puerto rico a beautiful island with the most hospitable people i have met and yet because our nation refuses to faces its imperial responsibilities puerto ricans are allowed to wither and spiritual crisis that the colonial situation of puerto rico has created if undermining families and the basic institutions that sustain any society corruption is rampant to the extent that people are not paying taxes has led a fiscal crisis for this nation and a sense of cynicism and distrust permeate the a grant allowed this painful yet powerful film to be must see
i loved this film i thought it would be easy to watch and easy to forget i ran out after watching this to buy the dvd obv not easily script is brilliant and the casting couldn't be more perfect each character has their moment and i laughed hard throughout this film comedic timing was
the film is hugely enjoyable with a great cast and excellent direction by james eves the movie is entertaining with a very charismatic performance from stephanie beecham and everyone is perfectly cast james eves has a good eye for casting and directs like a conductor knowing exactly when to crank up the action fall and then rise to a climax he does this with an element of humour plenty of twists thrills and blood this is a return of the old vampire movie with loads of gore blood and screams the movie works at a great speed and the characters take you on a terrific what makes it work is that the film doesn't take itself too seriously with plenty of tongue in cheek
this movie has been made by one of the most absurd humorists in canada yves p pelletier i was shocked for a second that he made a romantic comedy but knowing he was a heavy cinephile was seen in every local festival and in the local cinematheque i had a positive feeling about this i was right right off the bat the scenario by pelletier himself is a bit twisted and hard to follow but in fashion a one-of-a-kind minutes inspired and mostly transformed allusion to dangerous liaisons laclos les aimants consists of a twisted game of writing notes on the fridge throughout the movie you'll get the occasion to find out who and writing to who on that goddam pops up in an interesting love storyline great photography great quotations of other movies should we ask more for a first movie
an excellent family movie gives a lot to think on absolutely nothing wrong in this film everything is just perfect the script is great so real such things could happen in life and don't forget about acting just awesome just look at frankie and you'll know what i thought about this picture is a real can't-miss
name just says it all i watched this movie with my dad when it came out and having served in korea he had great admiration for the man the disappointing thing about this film is that it only concentrate on a short period of the life interestingly enough the entire life would have made such an epic bio-pic that it is staggering to imagine the cost for posters elude to the flawed characteristics about the man which are cheap shots the theme of the movie duty honor country are not just mere words blathered from the lips of a high-brassed officer it is the deep declaration of one total devotion to his peck being the liberal that he was garnered a better understanding of the man he does a great job showing the fearless general tempered with the humane side of the man
the extraordinary rosemary forsyth is the main reason to see this flick why she never became a bigger store may never be known but she is exceptional and steals every scene in garson kanin directed this piece of fluff and the cast is first rate with robert drivas and brenda vaccaro especially memorable a out of
not often have i had the feeling of a movie it could be visionary but clearly this movie has the seed of a should not tend to be alarmists and see armageddon in something because it seems to fit our emotions of the moment but didn't we say this of had james orwell known the internet becoming reality not long after in fact it was in he might have reconsidered writing his story the way he did hindsight doesn't matter what does matter is that we often regard ourselves as superior to our surroundings but indeed become emotional about a love apple when necessity knocks at our door a snapshot of ourselves at old the time-line will prove to be for us i know for a fact we haven't seen the beginning of it
wow i loved this film it may not have had the funding and advertising that the latest hollywood blockbusters get but it packs twice the emotional punch the tale revolves around this one family from utah and the connections between the people in the family that provide the film with its punch the main lead ribisi plays his part very well at no time does he leave you to believe that acting all his feelings his brother koteas who stole the show for me though when the two were in scenes together they bounded their lines off of each other giving fantastic performances great cast great film
i loved it fred macmurray is wonderful as skid johnson a somewhat conceited proud yet at the same time very vulnerable saxophone player who is in love with maggie lombard always there for him they meet in panama after maggie comes off a ship and end up in a bar with anthony quinn tony gets punched in the nose after her insults maggie by thinking her a loose woman all because she took off her hat in public big brawl and maggie ends up stuck in panama romance carole and arthur are great together maggie is always there for him whenever he needs her she urges him to go to ny where watch the movie and find out they have these wonderful scenes together where she sings in his arms while he plays the saxophone i definitely recommend it
the critics didn't like this film it bombed in the states and as a result received only a limited showing in britain which was a great shame because it represents british rather than american humour and should have been shown in britain kidman looks stunning and is a totally convincing russian ben chaplin is the dustin hoffman character from the graduate and birthday girl has at least scenes which remind the viewer of that classic being a totally different it changes tack a number of times from comedy to black comedy to thriller to adventure but memorable moving and a weclome breath of fresh air compared to the average mega-budget it with an open mind
this movie is up there with the all-time classics the music camera shots and acting are excellent showing the movie in black and white gave it a much better appearance and complemented the music perfectly like psycho its surprising how so few people have commented on this movie my guess is that its a hard movie to find i gave the film a see the movie and you'll know what i'm talking about
great woody allen no good woody allen definitely i found myself along with the audience in attendance laughing hard and often at some of the best woody allen lines we've heard in a while the aging allen created an appropriate role for himself as scarlett father well sort of some have said johansson plays a young dianne keaton i beg to differ she plays dialogue which in his comedies always has a very similar well a woody allen comedy fine for us woody appreciators she certainly did dialogue far better than the young cast of his last comedy some may find humor tiresome but for those of us who love it when done right we look forward to the next
after watching this film last night on sundance i realized that much of style was first done in this film here we have many of the same elements of the ringu series especially the idea of the media being the source of the supernatural instead of the cursed videotape we instead having a haunted studio and strange images appearing on film in fact the strange images appearing on film brings immediately the cursed videotape in ringu to mind the only thing missing was the obsession to water that runs through later films the final scenes are quite chilling with a bit of a nod to murnau what with the door opening by itself ands the ghost entering the room reminds me immediatly a chilling movie that will make think twice about going up to a catwalk
this is one of the better comedies that has ever been on television season one was hilarious as were most of the following seasons the only reason that i give this show a is because of the unfortunate final season the only good part of the final season was the finale my favorite part of this show was the scenes that cut to imaginations often depicting the characters in famous tv shows or movies from the it is a rare show in that i liked every character the exception of the final late to try to develop a new character and fez wasn't nearly as funny foot in your ass comments never got old nor did stupidity bravo to fox for keeping such a good show so long too long even
the impossible planet and the satan pit together comprise the two best episodes of the new doctor second season having said that it should be obvious that much of the story basically transposes the plot of quatermass and the pit to an outer space setting with the history of the universe intertwined with that of the beast these episodes cement the emotional ties between rose and the doctor whilst also highlighting increasing self-confidence establishing her as a not-quite-equal-yet-but-getting-there partner with our beloved time lord also of note is matt jones elegant screenplay which decreases the occasional over-reliance on one-liners for the doctor and the performances of the entire cast most notably the excellent shaun parkes as acting captain zachary cross flane
this fabulous movie must be viewed knowing that millions scraped together cents to see it and forget the gloomy day-to-day economic conditions during the remember cents bought a loaf of bread back then so this was a minor luxury for many people testimony to how hollywood did its best to make the usa feel a little better about itself you'll note that with the studio system in hollywood at the time many of the actors and actresses were type-cast in similar movies james cagney william powell ruby keeler frank mchugh joan blondell and guy kibbee then too branches of the military were always respected with enthusiasm and patriotism as in the use of military precision marching by the great choreographer busby berkeley at the end
atlantis the lost empire has some of the best smoothest animation and cleverly written dialogue of any disney movie i've seen and i was convinced of that in the first minutes i especially love don voice work on vincenzo santorini and phil morris as joshua strongbear sweet too bad the whole film seems to move at about double the pace that would be appropriate at least in the first act one important aspect of any disney movie is a satisfying antagonist which atlantis doesn't provide average at best halfway through the movie a mediocre twist all a great movie nevertheless everyone should check it out
i loved this movie it was one of the years best pornos i remember watching it on starz or some god damn thing but it was great i only saw like half of it and i taped it and all i can say is i loved every minute of what i saw i didnt sleep for weeks after i saw this movie i was very tired
artimisia was on late last night at first i didn't think i would like it but seeing i didn't feel like sleeping yet and nothing else being on i continued watching and felt myself intrigued by the young artimisia a virgin pure and passionate her romance with the older tassi envoked recognisable feelings even though the film is based on a very romantisised level and not reality i loved it a lot more than the usual biographys or costume great play great camerashots great music and texts i loved it and i want more of it
this very funny british comedy shows what might happen if a section of london in this case pimlico were to declare itself independent from the rest of the uk and its laws taxes post-war restrictions merry mayhem is what would explosion of a wartime bomb leads to the discovery of ancient documents which show that pimlico was ceded to the duchy of burgundy centuries ago a small historical footnote long since forgotten to the new burgundians however this is an unexpected opportunity to live as they please free from any interference from holloway is excellent as the minor city politician who suddenly finds himself leading one of the tiniest nations dame margaret rutherford is a delight as the history professor who sides with pimlico others in the stand-out cast include hermione baddeley paul duplis naughton wayne basil radford sir michael to burgundy
this is the best movie i've come across in a long while not only is this the best movie of its way ben director decided to film it was magnificent he filmed it using teenage actors who were still attending high school he filmed it in the actors own rooms and used the actors real parents as their parents in the film also the actors were filming too using camcorders making it seem much more like a video diary it is almost that is indeed a are a few slip ups however for example when cal calls land rover a range vice versa been awhile since i've seen it
this little-appreciated movie is one of my favorites i can watch it over and over dreyfus and braga are masterful but raul julia steals the show a tongue-in-cheek menacingly humorous gomez addams with just the right tone for this irreverent spoof of this oft-told untrumpeted and unappreciated moon over parador allows you to check out of reality and join the fun going on up on the screen two thumbs up
i was pleased with the cast of reputable players the story is one of standing up for a cause even if you are at personal risk in doing so in a time where violence and pain are often in the movie forefront this movie focuses on the old fashioned good cop although similar plots have been done repeatedly these guys pull it off well kick back and enjoy dennehy is a master of taking over a movie
really enjoyed this little movie a moving film about struggle sacrifice and especially the bonds of friendship between different peoples child actor who plays miki is especially good so many large scale impersonal films set around that this convincingly told little story is a real break from the norm and an original one at that i'll also add that this film is far from boring very far of course the horses are wonderful and the scenery breathtaking to anyone who really treats their animal as part of the family do you'll find this film especially rewarding recommended to movie fans who look for something a little different
i saw shadow at the tribeca film festival and loved it judd hirsch and scott cohen are great as father and son the film follows scott cohen from parole in alaska back to his family in brooklyn he shows up there because his brother has died and he embarks on a journey to slowly repair his estranged relationships with his wife and child and his father who has never forgiven him for being the black sheep of the family the story takes us deep into the hearts and minds of this family and allows you to more deeply understand the complexity of their lives also the imagery of the woodworking business and the brooklyn backdrop sets the tone for this rich and revealing family portrait
my comment would have been added to the release date section but i couldn't find a place for it i was really surprised to see that this movie was released in the in feb i saw it in a first run theater in washington in march wonder if it was re-released or some problem in my opinion this movie is very light entertainment but has some classic characters john mcintyre does a bang-up job as a corrupt walter brennan does basically the same role he did in red river years earlier and in my opinion james stewart gives as fine a performance as he ever did i have seen this movie a half dozen times or more and never tire of seeing parts of it again the photography and scenery are splendid and it offers a remarkable amount of entertainment in one hour and thirty-six minutes
my rating is merely for the fun factor and assumes that you decided that you liked slaughter high even before watching it yes the typical revenge-several-years-after-a-dirty-prank story but how can you not like some of the stuff that they pull here i couldn't have predicted that bathtub scene in a million so maybe we could be cynical and say that this movie offers nothing new well it doesn't pretend to the sort of flick that the characters in scream probably watched and it contributed to their rules about how to survive a horror movie after all who doesn't like to watch people suffer for doing these things obviously got sort of a reactionary undertone as people get punished for doing what the championed but still you gotta love this stuff so with apologies to don mclean this jester didn't sing for the king and queen
i just watched this for the first time in a long time i had forgotten both how imaginative the images were and how witty the movie is i had not forgotten however the opening scenes which are the scene at the candlelight club in waterloo bridge among the most romantic ever interested in politics or history will love the offhand references anyone interested in romance will be moved by hunter-niven and anyone who loves visual imagery will enjoy the depiction of the favorite movie remains odd man out made near the same time but this one is superb
hard to tell you more about this film without spoiling it i enjoyed it because i wasn't expecting what i was seeing but an ordinary sex-drama so a pscyho-sexual thriller in which nothing is what it seems it features emmanuelle seigner no stranger to the genre to nudity in which her husband polanski had directed her and a creepy performance i say creepy from toreton actor it looks like a pascal bruckner meets roman polanski than bitter moon like a chabrol gone astray or clouzot thriller have seen someone mentioning les diaboliques but closer to georges les yeux sans visage without a face the godfather of dr phibes and more a gem i am just afraid they will blow this into a hollywood remake like they did with nighwatch and the vanishing
this is right up at the top of my list of the most hysterically funny shows i've ever seen i laughed so hard i'm sure i missed half the jokes this showcases izzard as the brilliantly gifted comedian he is what i particularly like is that he seems never to be dumbing down the material for his audience his timing is impeccable and the routine is tied together as a performance piece rather than just a series of gags thumbs way up
this is one of those westerns that well stands practically alone in the unrelieved quality of its dialog very few can hold up to it over the long haul that said the rest is pretty bad nevertheless i am giving it an eight because there is no other western with such consistently good dialog with maybe the exception of the wild bunch junior bonner and perhaps a few more is riddled with weaknesses john drew barrimore the most glaring however it does have one truly memorable scene nothing like it its right after kid wichita kills the sheriff and goes to jack elams place trying to goad him into a fight wonderful stuff right up with the best in any western
disney the wonderful folks at pixar of course offer a nice humourous story combined with the best of computer animation i admit that maybe the faces of the bugs were a little more static than in antz and they only had four legs antz six but backgrounds were superb and animation was breathtaking but let this be a lesson it was not the computer who made it such a success it was the man behind the machine who added the nice little twists which i missed in antz some highlights were of course the bloopers at the end keep watching at the end worth it which were highly amusing and original the line filmed entirely on location was intended for the more attentive viewer
stupid stupid stupid i think that angelina jolie is probably one of the most talented actress today but a movie like this isn't just worth her time she deserves better and so does everyone else in this movie talent is just wasted sorry but i don't feel like writing a review for give it no stars out of
although a tear jerker it is definitely a feel good movie all the actors were excellent and will smith as always does the job and does it well i could go on but pick any ten of the ratings and they've said it as well and likely better than i could since i must include at least lines to post a comment i will say that rosario dawson was largely unknown to me as a viewer her performance was most enjoyable and i look forward to seeing her perform in many films to this film demonstrates that will smith has nothing further to prove in terms of his ability as an actor
kenny doughty as jed willis is sexier in this role than any male porn star even though he keeps his pants movie tore at my heart reminding me of the intensity of the big explosive love of my life i don't think i can think of another movie except perhaps romeo and juliet that captures that giddy joy that other draw of the movie is the very english eccentric characters enjoying the scandal vicariously in that sense it is much the same appeal as midsomer murder or a miss marple mystery without the is a great antidote to the mock horror currently popular in the usa an any relationships between people of different ages
i found the film quite expressive the way the main character was lost but at the same much more clear about certain things in life than people who mocked him his flatmate for example was tortured and you loved to watch him being tortured it had this perverted side which was frightening but we were all happy to see him come out of the misery again was like a game character or pan-man through a mine-land or to enemy and we love to watch him under sniper attack or fire but then at the end we are happy to see him survive
atlantis was much better than i had anticipated in some ways it had a better story than come of the other films aimed at a higher age although this film did demand a solid attention span at times it was a great film for all ages i noticed some of the younger audience expected a comedy but got an adventure i think everyone is tired of an endless parade of extreme parodies a lot of these kids have seen nothing but parodies after a short time everyone seemed very intensely watching atlantis
i work at a movie store and as such i am always on the look-out for an excellent movie i decided to check out nothing as it sat in our canadian section and i've been trying to support my movie industry i was in for a surprise the film features david hewlett and andrew miller in a highly entertaining story that seems to delve into so much of our minds and working that hard it is consistently comedic through the interaction of the two characters as well as some funny exchanges can't be dead we have cable what more can i say without noting that it is worth a shot even if you abandon it within the first half an hour
well if you are one of those film-nuts like me you sure will appreciate this metaphysical katana swinging blood spitting samurai action tadanobu asano barren illusion ryu daisuke this samurai war between clan versus clan touch the zenith in the final showdown at gojo bridge the body-count is magic swords shinto priests versus buddhist monks and the beautiful visions provided by maestro sogo ishii will do the good japanese flick for a rainy summer night
putting the ufo thing aside this was the best documentary i've seen factual reporting by neil and buzz a must see the interviews and reporting are a revelation since most of the information was stamped confidential in and only released in no documentary to date has the detail or accuracy for such a brief minutes the facts will blow you away and you will be left in awe of the risks taken to be the first on the moon neil and buzz are probably the biggest of our time ever see a man save his own life bet not neil saves his life when only mili-seconds separated him from death amazing to watch it is a travesty people have not known all the details assosiated with landing on the moon and the courage those men had when facing certain death from a failing computer stars
young is a film that captures the myth of one of the most revered figures in american history henry fonda had the difficult task of portraying a mythical figure and at the same time make him human enough for people to care about it is perhaps the actors best how he singlehandedly stops a brady is fantastic in the role of a simple farmer of the last part of the film plays out in a there lies the only negative thing i can say about this of the characters from judge to spectators are given so many folksy humorously lines that distracts from the serious trial that is on i'm quite used to this because the humor is a ford trademark supporting parts by ward bond and donald meek are very good
well done giving the perspective of the other side fraulein doktor captures both the cost and the futility of war excellent acting especially when german high command refuses in the name of chivalry to present medal kaiser ordered struck the scenes of carnage are probably too intense for effete us minds who'd probably prefer some silly speeches and senseless abstractions like points or the league of nations real americans might appreciate the story line and the action for all the action and intrigue fraulein doktor compares to ladder
this is simply a classic film where the human voices coming from the animals are really what they're thoughts are i don't know whether my video copy has a scene missing but it never shows how the dogs got out of the pit it also shows an animals survival instinct and tracking humans in the same position ant the helicopters would be out for once an original film is improved by a remake as the voice-over for the first has been removed only the use of animals can work in a film of this kind because using people would have had to spice out the story by turning it into are more interesting than people
i really liked this movie it was good and the actors were brilliant leon robinson who played richard and many other classic singers is very good at his job when you see him in a musical movie you know that it is going to be good i would suggest that people watch this heart warming sad and special movie if they want to know more about richard outstanding fresh
moonstruck is a movie that i liked the first time i watched it i really liked it the second time i loved it the third time now it is one of my all time humor is subtle but really good the film offers a lot of warmth humor the story takes place in a old school italian neighborhood in nyc search for love is enjoyable to watch this film is by far the best job nicholas cage has done on film the old man character is fantastic he lights up the screen without saying a word the scene with his dogs howling at the moon was fantastic but perhaps the best character is the one played by olympia climax is a scene where the main characters have it out over a breakfast of oatmeal in the family kitchen exceptional direction and wrap up
well was morgan freeman any more unusual as god than george burns this film sure was better than that bore oh god i was totally engrossed and lmao all the way through carrey was perfect as the out of sorts anchorman wannabe and aniston carried off her part as the frustrated girlfriend in her usual well played performance i for one don't consider her to be either ugly or untalented i think my favorite scene was when carrey opened up the file cabinet thinking it could never hold his life history see if you can spot the file in the cabinet that holds the events of his bathroom humor i was rolling over this one well written and even better played out this comedy will go down as one of this best
this is a gorgeous movie visually the images of the mexican desert the old mansion the characters in their picturesque amount to a real work of story seems a bit loose but because not meant to be realistic it is taken from a book called one hundred years of solitude and it is supposed to be an evocation of the isolated otherworldly atmosphere of latin america so far from god and so close to the united states the tremendous debt that erendira owes to her grandmother is symbolic of latin international debt burden although there many layers of you can appreciate a slow-moving richly-textured movie this one is for you
director sidney lumet has made some day afternoon or was not having too much luck on his most recent was pathetic and find me guilty was an failed brings his best film in decades my point of true the devil knows you're think this film is like a rebirth for movie has an excellent story many think the ending of the movie is performances are seymour hoffman magnificent performance and of the best actors of our hawke is also an excellent actor but underrated by my point of performance in here is rest of the cast is also great albert finney but these two actors bring monumental performances which were sadly ignored by the pathetic film has a good level of part thanks to the performances to the brilliant the devil knows you're dead is a real masterpiece with perfect great screenplay and excellent need more movies like this

a chinese scholar who criticizes harshly the arrogant nationalist warmongering policies of the ruling clique around the emperor in pre-war japan is accused of being a communist and jailed for life his loving wife who supports totally her husband and his ideas is left alone to save her family from starvation this movie is a huge statue erected in praise of the role of the mother in the history of mankind sayuri yoshinaga is not less than sublime in the title role and it was a monumental scandal that she didn't get an asian oscar for the best female role in it went to a young girl with very limited acting deeply moving and most human feature is a must see for all true children on earth
this movie is a masterpiece a story of a young woman during the war and it really happen not exactly as the movie but it is a great story i was impress by this film the acting and the story where great i like this film because it is a true story giff me a feeling that i was there and i feel sorry for the ca-rector that maruschka detmers is playing because who wants to end here life that way i recommend that everybody have to see this film special the young ones and ma by the learn something from this film this film you can compare whit the movie soldier from orange or any real story that happened in the
pre-adolescent humor is present in large quantities the acting and story are wonderful if you can stomach the concept those with weak constitutions will have some difficulty since the worms are realistic enough to cause churning of more than a few in the cavanagh and hallie kate eisenberg stole the spotlight but the young ty panitz could get some serious time on screen over the next few eisenberg has developed from a cute face into a strong young actress with charm and wonderful comic delivery story does a spectacular job in dealing with bullying friendship and fairness it creates an opportunity to discuss these topics in an open and frank manner while recalling some gross scene from the film
this movie is great if you enjoy watching b-class movies that is this is a classic college slasher movie in which one song is played throughout the entire soundtrack a horrible film but worth renting to make fun of or just to watch old men pop out of closets with knives kinda funny if you ask me
lost is the best tv series there of has great actors and wonderful writing is a very controversial issue because in the first two seasons the writing was extraordinary but after season the writing became highly is are there polar bears on the the did the island is richard lot of people think that the writers are lost and that they have raised a lot of questions and mysteries that they can't believe these people are have confidence in the think that if the mysteries are revealed from now all the charm of the series will be is undeniably the greatest tv series and it will continue to be for a long time
i saw this film at international documentary film festival and was privileged to meet both the directors and tobias schneebaum all of whom are lively and outspoken new yorkers the title in amsterdam was keep the river on your right making the sensational aspect of cannibalism somewhat less prominent equally important was the loving and gay relationship tobias schneebaum had with members of the groups he studied as an anthropologist his reunion at nearly years of age and inevitable leave-taking were very moving i can only highly recommend this film to anyone looking for a moving story that is anything but pedestrian
this film contains more action before the opening credits than are in entire hollywood films of this sort this film is produced by tsui hark and stars jet li this team has brought you many worthy hong kong cinema productions including the once upon a time in china series the action was fast and furious with amazing wire work i only saw the wires in two shots aside from the action the story itself was strong and not just used as filler to find any other action films to rival this you must look for a hong kong cinema outlet in your area they are really worth checking out and usually never disappoint
before nicholas cage was a big action star he was a great actor this lesser-known movie is where cage gives one of his best performances red rock west was a low-budget almost un-known film but is one of my favorite movies of all time i discovered it walking down the video store aisle and wanted to see cage and hopper also is great in the movie appear together go get this one and i'm sure you won't be disappointed
i will never forget when i saw this title in the video store way back when i was always a big weird al fan and when i saw this video i rented and watched it i was too young to appreciate all of subtle humor and satire at the time but i remember it much later when i was old enough to understand what i was watching if you are an al fan especially of his earlier work you will thoroughly enjoy this film it is done in the mtv-esque rockumentary style and tells a true sometimes exaggerated tale of how al got to be where he was in you will love it if you like his brand of humor and more importantly his music
i saw this in the early i was and despite the long slow set-up meetings riots etc once the desert section began all fell into context and i loved it do it has aged very well back then i was in what seemed to be a tiny minority all criticisms seemed to concentrate on the lack of action and narrative happily i'm no longer in such a minority deftly shows a somewhat prophetic way the political splintering unrest confrontation brutal repression commercialisation and deception which lay for this magistral film has grown and i'm glad about that
good story good script good casting good acting good directing good art direction good photography good sound good editing good everything put it all together and you end up with good shame of it is that there aren't nearly enough films of this caliber being made these days we may count ourselves lucky that like john hughes are occasionally able to make their creative voices i notice that i'm watching a film for the third or fourth time and still find it thoroughly satisfying i have to conclude that something about that film is right
this movie was charming an accountant wants more from life than the approved conventional success what makes it work so well and makes it so different from the standard dance movie is that it really isn't about becoming great it is simply about finding a way to express self the big triumph at the end is not the winning of a contest not the discovery of a whole new life style but the simple joy of doing what you want to fulfill the other parts of your life no one is discovering their passion they are finding their quiet japanese background makes the subtle oppression and secret life of ballroom dancing both understandable and personal we can all see ourselves in the everyman
while the sparkling chemistry between ryan and robbins alone is reason enough to see this movie the supporting cast matthau fry shalub durning and the hilarious trio of jacobi saks and maher is an additional plus matthau shines as einstein fry is perfect as clinical fiancé and line about gonads is as has been noted one of the highlights of the film the speech that robbins delivers at his first appearance in public is sheer poetry kudos to the writers for handling this froth with wit and levity i also thought that keene curtis was wonderful as eisenhower this might be considered something of a chick movie but i think everyone will get a kick out of it eight very solid points
surely one of the best british films ever made if not one of the best films ever made anywhere script cinematography direction and acting in a class on their own this film works on so many levels so why is it completely unavailable on tape dvd never shown on tv why is it hidden away when it is regularly shown at the national film theatre in london to packed houses
overall the film is ok i think better than sepet and much better than gubra in term of its story its sentimental are a few scenes that makes me touched yes i agree that the boy did his acting very good brilliant i can say that his acting is almost the song ne me quitte pas by nina simone really menaikkan my bulu roma love the song both the song ne me quitte pas and hujan i just downloaded the song salute to yasmin the ending credit makes me touched again we can see how yasmin really appreciated her parents in an unique think the movie deserves that grand prix of international jury at berlin film give out of stars
second-feature concerns a young woman in london desperate for a job happy to accept live-in secretarial position with an elderly woman and her son thrillers about people being held in a house against their will always make me a little end up feeling like a prisoner this rather classy b-film is neither lurid nor claustrophobic far-fetched and unlikely but not uninteresting and our heroine foch is quick on her feet rehashing this in dead of winter proved not to be wise as the plot-elements are not of the modern-day julia ross is extremely compact short at minutes but it stays the course nicely until a too-rushed climax which feels a little sloppy from
i saw this film at the santa barbara film festival and there was not a dry eye in the house it is incredible to see not only what a great person darius is but how admirable the rest of the team is too and at such a young also made me think how disgusting mtv was and how on being given an opportunity to involve and inspire in a positive way they declined shows you whether they really care about the youth and their viewers at a wonderful and heart warming true your tissues but great to see how caring and inspiring youth of today can be
strangely enough this movie never made it to the big screen in denmark so i had to wait for the video release my expectations where high but they where in no way disappointed as always with ang lee there is fantastic acting an intelligent and thrilling plot that has you guessing right till the end and superb filming along with unforgiven this is easily one of the two best westerns of the who expect something along the line of mel gibson in the or will be sourly disappointed all others who appreciate the above mentioned qualities will have a fantastic time watching it out of
charming in every way this film is perfect if you're in the mood to feel good if you love jazz music it is a must see if you enjoy seeing loveable characters that make you smile can bring a tear to your eye and swing like no tomorrow this film is for you if you are looking for an intense deep heavy piece of art to be dissected and analyzed perhaps you best stick with something by darren aronofsky other words reviewer djjohn lighten up don't you know a good time when you see one my only complaint is that the movie was just too darn short i guess i'll just have to watch it several more times to get my fill
cecil b demille really knew how to create a classic and after decades his western comes across as the real mccoy engrossing entertaining spectacular in no way a real fan of deadwood i'll tell you the performances of gary cooper as wild bill hickock and jean arthor as calamity jane are far more don't have any giants in hollywood anymore plainsman is just one of dozens of classics from the decade that have seen enduring commercial life decade after decade released re-issued re-issued all over again filmmakers like spielberg jackson bruckheimer are like kids playing in a sandbox none of movies will be sought out in months let alone years
the british horror film was in terminal decline by the start of the seventies but out of the blackness came three films that were among the best our island produced the wickerman blood on claw and the house that dripped blood made the future seem rosy even though a lot of people knew by this point there wasn't going to be one thtdb has the sort of cast that could easily form a wishlist if it hadn't actually been assembled in the bleak hinterland of you may well find yourself expecting to wake up waxworks is the most overlooked of the four stories and is naturally my favourite life and art are interlinked so firmly that you can't tell where performance ends and pain begins one can only guess how this role affected such a gentle sensitive man death and the maiden rip peter
this movie is my all time favorite you really have to see michael jackson in this wonderful film i'm always over the moon watching it this is a film that you really have to see also if you aren't a mj fan cause this film writes like captain eo and ghosts a bit of film and music history this wonderful film out of feather is a must have and smooth criminal is really the most wonderful exciting and amazing song i've ever heard in my life thank you michael for this film and i love you the best musician to hit this planet a fine man and he always brings sparkles in your eyes when you listen to his music please if you don't know this film watch it and don't miss it because would be too bad for yourself if you'd miss it recommanded film for every movie
the tempest is a model for this exceptional science fiction film we look for differences prospero and his daughter miranda are stranded on a mediterranean island morbius and altaira are marooned on the planet circling the star altair ariel is a spirit robby the robot is a man-made servant evil hardly approaches that of monsters of the id shakespeare spares prospero morbius dies when altair blows up the tempest is a comedy forbidden planet is a tragedy we wonder if mankind must suffer the fate of the krell in some future time anne francis is altaira jack kelly is lieutentant farman kelly starred with james garner in the tv series maverick
if i didn't know any better it almost seems like it was staged but it wasn't it was set up perfectly and how they got all of that footage is amazing the unfortunate events of september are put together well in this documentary and the classic footage that they got made this an unfortunate classic just the history in the footage alone should make it a must see for any american or person touched by the tragedy of september
i was shocked and surprised by the negative reviews i saw on the web i thought cinderella well as is a very cute and funny sequel for everyone kids and me i am years also find it and very informative film it shows lessons on being true to yourself and following your heart i thought it has great animation and the voice casting was very good the songs performed by brooke allison too since this film has been divided into three my favorite out of the three is the story of when jaq the mouse became a human for a day thanks to fairy godmother and her magic
two great comedians in a great neil simon movie based on his hit combination especially when the comedians in question are matthau and burns small wonder why burns won an oscar for this as sharp and as funny as ever and matthau is every bit his match if a tad more is familiar simon territory two old vaudeville partners reunite for a tv special but still can't stand one another after all these a delight to watch these two pick at each other their scenes together make this film an absolute delight myself i especially enjoyed the knock knock knock enter scene and if you're a fan of either burns or matthau you'll enjoy it fact you'll enjoy the whole movie stars put a little sunshine in your life
was the script more fitting for a minute sitcom yes but they still make it work i thought the actors did a fantastic job with an otherwise bland script especially jack black and christopher walken most people on the board seem to really hate this film i personally can't see how that could be but envy is just one of those film that you either love it or hate it much like napoleon dynamite and every leslie neilsen movie ever made you either think one of the worst movies ever made or one of the funniest don't avoid this movie because of the reviews watch it and see if you're one of the ones who really like it if you do i guarantee worth your money if you don't like it well now you know
i watched the first series avidly but wondered whether i'd go back again after a lengthy break from it however i tuned into episode one of series and was hooked all over again this really is excellent telly ground-breaking stuff like back in the the characters are well rounded and expand as the series goes on they change as they adapt some more readily than others to their new surroundings but they cleverly remain strictly in character and yet it is more than possible to have sympathy for someone whom you wouldn't have thought you could ever feel sorry for when something really crushing happens to them i hope there will be many years of lost to look forward to and i don't actually mind all that much if i never get answers to all the mysteries
louis compelling classic is about as disney as freddy krueger got murder racism facial disfigurement and killer plotted a multi-layered interlinking story that spans history to reveal own heritage and the secret behind the holes it races from lush greenness to the pock-marked camp green lake no lake and no first success is re-creating the environments so convincingly the set design is superb and without gloss the other plus is in the casting rising star shia labeouf angels project greenlight might not be the fat boy of the book but his attitude is right and far from the usual clean-cut hero the rest of the cast is filled out equally well from patricia arquette as the frontier school marm-turned-bank robber to henry winkler as dad the downside is the pop soundtrack pure marketing department and having the sentiment turned up to full volume at the end
harem suare is the best film i saw in the year bravo ferzan ozpetek sensually shot and stunningly portrayed harem suare is a bold film that tackles interracial romance which is such a taboo in hollywood women of all shapes sizes and color populate the film cut off from the outside world the women entertain each other by telling stories about intrigue rivalry and jealousies within their ranks
spoilers this is a gripping movie about grifters but who is conning who here when does the hunter turn into the prey this gritty dark movie is slow moving and seductive it pulls you in and drags you down the proverbial garden path only to waylay you just as you think you are has a riveting script with good acting least from the leads i didn't notice the background music but it was never jarring so it must have been done was very surprised that i liked this movie because i don't usually go for this genre but this one sucked me in and kept he hooked until the end
this show was fabulous it was intricate and well written and all the characters where likable with out being horribly sweet even jonathan cake the philandering boyfriend was likable since our airwaves are filled with crap like american idol and dancing with the stars it was nice to see a drama that was not too soap opera like it was always intriguing to see how each character would be connected to the next circumstance it really is annoying that we finally get a show that makes you think a little bit and have it thrown out because of some mysterious number that most of us don't even pay attention to some of us are not sheep this show will be missed maybe not by a lot of people but by some pretty loyal fans
i often wonder why this series was slammed so much i thought it was brilliant and also very cleverly written and performed i think in time to come it will be seen in the light it deserves that is if they ever issue it many up and coming young comedy actors appeared in this and all went on to greater things maybe this fact will make people aware of its value and it will have to be issued sally phillips simon pegg peter serafinowicz and not least julian rhind-tutt of the hugely successful green wing the writers graham linehan and arthur matthews are two of the finest comedy writers of the modern age anyone that can produce comedy like father ted couldn't be capable of writing something not worthy of publication if it is ever issued i will certainly buy it
first off this really is my favorite film ever i don't need to give anyone a description because every does that i am literally obsessed with this practically bloodless cheesy lame effects having boom-stick showing badly edited metal horror masterpiece the director heard had hoped for a hit at the box office so that he could do sequels and have a type of deal for himself damn i wish that could've went down like that the banging the this mofo out and any die-hard fans out there feel free to email and chat sometime can be found at yahoo
does anyone know where or how i can get a copy of this film i've been searching for way too long someone help back in my girlfriends and i were extras on this long island based film and we actually never got to see it was hoping i could find a copy somehow so i can finally check it out and share it with the girls is there anyone out there who knows where to get a copy of this so i can stop driving myself crazy it doesn't matter if its in in vhs format i'm still in the ice age myself if you or anyone you know has a copy of this film please help i would be willing to pay for a good copy of it
i don't understand why the reviews of this film are so universally bad unless i'm just off my rocker i found it sick brilliant twisted and psychologically sophisticated you won't get deeper into the mind of a criminal psychopath in a hollywood film than this one it has layers within layers nuanced acting by a plot that will keep you guessing even after over people need to get over the fact that sharon stone is that michael douglas isn't in this one i predict that this film will be a huge hit on dvd once people see it for themselves and stop paying attention to the drivel professional reviewers put out give it a shot you might be glad you did
this film deals with the irish rebellion in the and more specifically one life after he informs on a friend for the bounty on his head and the subsequent consequences watching the film i got the feeling that you could take the script and with just some minor updates do it again and it sadly would still fit contemporary events but te remake wouldn't be nearly as good a magnificent performance by victor mclaglen which he deservedly got an oscar and a fine ensemble cast that includes most if not all the actors with brogues in hollywood at the time most of them recognizable character actors either established at the time or just starting out a very good film well worth watching highly recommended
entertaining jim belushi vehicle a modern cockeyed version of a wonderful life michael caine plays a sort-of angel who lets belush see what life would have been like if he had made it big jim is at his best with a good story and supporting cast seems like real chemistry between him and hamilton not an oscar contender but good warm-hearted fun
breathtaking this is without doubt the best anime cartoon ever made i first saw castle in the sky in the late as a child and it left a lasting impression years went by and i forgot the title of the film and only by chance browsing on the internet i found this masterpiece again after reading other peoples reviews and analysis i'm not surprised it has such acclaim and touched so many because it does leave an impression a true fantasy adventure a must see for all children and adults its best not giving the story away so i would say watch this movie will a clear and open mind if you have kids treat them to this i promise you they will love it not much to say about this piece of art but if you've not seen it watch it and enjoy
this movie really rocks jeff wincott is terrific in the film his fighting incredible he is such a fast martial artist brigitte nielsen matthias hues was very good mission of justice is an action packed movie that is never boring if you like fighting movies with incredible non stop action then check out mission of justice today
so often with stephen king adaptations you just get a collection of characters reciting dialogue from the books this really captures the heart of the book maybe because they don't use large chunks of text straight from the book but a bit more of an improv of the events in the story a big part of its success is miko hughes as baby gage dale midkiff and denise tasha yar crosby really act like his parents a scene where louis is cuddling gage and they are very natural together fred gwynne is wonderful he nails the maine accent perfectly without lapsing into parody and is wise and warm just like jud should be (8 out of
tcm is keeping me awake all the time they keep coming up with films ive never heard of senso now ossessione a very early film by visconti wow the italian version of the postman always rings beautifully acted and directed never heard of either leads who were excellent clara giovanna and especially massimo girotti as gino what a sensual man more muscular and attractive than anyone else on the screen in his look was ahead of its male stars from the were probably inspired by him he should have been a major world wide star the film is much better than the jack lange version and less glossier than the mgm version i really like with john garfield and lana turner remember that white outfit who can forget this italian version is different more realistic and with a very different ending see it watch going to buy it
in a word excellent this is the movie go and see it the director ron howard i mean the director ron howard did a fantastic job as he usually does an incredible attention to detail vivid colors and decorations breathtaking whoville atmosphere astonishing variety of costumes wait more to it than that the story is very good too clearly a message to be extracted from it by the thoughtful viewers jim carrey is top-notch he is probably the best grinch possible the girl taylor momsen is real good i'm sure she has some great future the dog is cool all in all a very high quality christmas fairy-tale if you like fairy-tales for you if you like christmas for some other reviews here get a life it hurts me every time to see people out there who well got their hearts two sizes too small
excellent film showing the pathetic lives of two nutty old ladies they couldn't live together nor apart babbling constantly sometimes at the same time they hashed and re-hashed the past going on and on about what coulda shoulda woulda i found myself laughing at times but mostly i was taken with how utterly sad and abandoned these two women were see this one
i originally saw this film years ago during cinemax friday after dark when the cable box was built like a it intrigued me even though there is a pointless aspect to the film it is well performances of depardieu dewaere are very have a good chemistry together miou-miou makes a pink fur look movie like this probably wouldn't be made in these politically correct least not in the us since it seems to sensationalize things like casual sex this movie proves that with a talented cast also talented directing a good movie is a good movie no matter the saddened me to find out patrick dewaere committed suicide in the near future will check him out with depardieu miou-miou in get out your hankerchief
this film needs to be seen the truest picture of what is going on in the world that i've seen since nightmare go see it and if you're lucky enough to have it open in your city be sure to see it on the big screen instead of dvd the writing is sharp and the direction is good enough for the ideas to come through though hardly perfect joan cusack is amazing and the rest of the cast is good too inspiring that john cusack got this movie made and i believe he had to use some of his own money to do it a wild absurd ride obviously made without the resources it needed but still succeeds jon stewart steven colbert snl even bill maher haven't shown the guts to say what this film says
this is a comedy based on national stereotypes no doubt if you leave away pretending you know or you care what communism was about and how real russians or brits are if you accept and are not hurt by the conventions you can have fun with this film nicole kidman is at her best sexy moving and funny ben chaplin succeeds to avoid being completely out-shadowed by nicole and the rest of the cast does good work as well the final is moving and logical movie logics of course worth watching if you accept the rules of the game
when i saw this film in the i wanted to be a scientist too there was something magical and useful in science i took a girl friend along to see it a second time i don't think she was as impressed as i was this film was comical yet serious at a time when synthetic fibres were rather new lessons from this film could be applied to issues relating to gm experimentation of today
michigan edgar allen poe a toaster and a frying pan if you don't mind the psycho-thriller or horror film genre and you have a special place in your heart for the twisted this is the movie for you an amazingly well developed first film hatred of a minute has all the draw of mainstream hits like silence of the lambs and of cult classics like army of darkness the editing and effects are well done better than many films in the genre kallio weaves an intricate tale of torment drawing on both the bible and writings at a time when big budget big name films lack much in the way of substance the independent film has resurrected this dying trait if you love michigan a good story or a decent thriller go check out hatred of a minute
i found the storyline in this movie to be very interesting best of all it left out the usual sex and violence getting old inserted in many movies the movie was well done in its flashbacks to days gone by in that area of the southwest the acting was also superb
this is one of the all-time great our gang shorts spanky is at his very cutest and funniest and the babies that he left to babysit are also hilarious tiny spanky is coerced by the gang into watching all their little siblings the opening shot of them all in baby carriages being entertained by various things hung by the gang from fishing poles is a beautiful appearance wearing his huge toy knife when asked to babysit by the older fellows is priceless as is his response where do you get that stuff i don't take care of no babies the tiny fellow saying remarkable throughout the film all the beautiful sight gags and spanky telling the babies all about tarzan add up to make this one of the best our you'll ever see
adam jones has a brilliant sense of humor there is nothing i didn't like about this film cross eyed was beautifully shot adam does a great job of not only developing the main characters but also the minor characters eyed gives hope to every low budget film out there that you don't have to spend a lot to create something worth watching there is something to like for everyone if you've had a terrible roommate if you've ever picked on a dork in high school if you've ever parked anywhere in the city if you have any type of sense of humor at all you will love this film this is the type of film that will be around for a long time and ends up resurfacing again once adam makes a bigger name for himself i look forward to future projects
this movie was excellent a sad truth to how culture tends to clash with the sexes this is just one big warm fuzzy type of movie you have the master who is steeped in tradition and kind hearted in his own way doggie despite being a girl thing to win his affections and you top it off with one cute monkey with a thousand facial expressions this equals on big happy movie in the end this movie does a good job at showing how steeped in tradition one can be so steeped that they are willing to die without sharing their secrets you see sides to a culture never seen before which helps enhance the drama that unfolds near the end of the picture the cinema-photography is excellent in particular the opening parade sequence with all the sparkers bound to be in oscar contention for best foreign film
plays have a way of transcending time the language somehow breaks the time barrier but perhaps it is the actors who really do the disappointment in romeo and juliet version with claire danes and leonardo dicaprio was hesitant take on another modern rendition of shakespeare to my surprise othello was character was played so well by the kenneth fellow even thoough iago is really evil and despicable the character was played so well that it does what shakespeare intended for the charater to be a pleasure for the audience to hate i have to say that performance here was really good as recommend this for shakespeare scholars and lazy students refuse to read the book alike
the plot of the story and the performance of the lead actors are very much down-to-earth the romance between two teen-age boys on the screen was done in good taste you can easily relate to their emotions if you are one but if you are not one you can appreciate the kind of love the film is trying to impart
i would love to comment on this film alas my search has always endeth in vain if any good citizen could help a desperate inhabitant of this ailing planet and restore his confidence in humanity by offering the whereabouts of either a uk vhs or loan him a dvd copy of the vhs he would without reservation be eternally grateful wrote the road to excess is the path to wisdom one hopes my weary road of excess will offer the path to fruition if not i will have to replay the excellent mr gothic in the knowledge that those who have seen haunted summer better or for worse have enriched their viewing pleasure of the events of july whilst i a fellow member of this melodious plot rests his lonely case in solitude
if you are looking for a sonic-boom-special-effects monster click the back button on your was written by ira levin the stepford wives baby a stage play adapted for the screen of the movie takes place in the gorgeous home of playwright sidney bruhl caine the author of a fabulously successful broadway play but his last efforts have flopped aspiring playwright clifford anderson reeve who attended a play-writing workshop given by sydney has sent him a copy of the play he has written sydney tells his wife myra cannon the play is fabulous a sure-fire hit but is it good enough to die for time will dialog and numerous twists and turns in the plot keep this movie entertaining from beginning to end the whole cast seems to have a good time reminiscent of another fun michael caine mystery sleuth worth
many of the reviews and comments i have read about this movie say that this is a rather stale film and performance by clara bow although the story-line was rather typical of later silents i still find it somewhat heart-stirring and incredibly fun clara plays a happy-go-lucky hawaiian girl who will stop at nothing to win the man she mind that this man is married lack of modesty was shocking in the day but i believe it lends to the sweetness and general fun of the movie though definitely not a brilliant story-line typical actually this movie is a nice showcase of ability to make the audience laugh
i don't quite know how to explain darkend room because to summarize it wouldn't really do it justice a quintessentially lynchian short film with two beautiful girls in a strange mysterious situation i would say this short is definitely more on the mulholland drive end of the lynchian spectrum as opposed to the elephant man or the straight story hidden on website and well worth the search
i have waited a long time for someone to film a faithful version of wells classic novel war of the worlds timothy hines has finally done it i just couldn't believe how good it was from the acting to the costuming the out-of-this world special effects i just can't say was wonderful dramatic intense full of first-rate performances by a top-notch cast got to be seen to be believed i sure didn't and i've read all those negative comments by the others and can't believe what they were saying we must've been watching a different movie huh and those real bad comments by that vepsaian guy guy whoever he is well he just doesn't know what talking up the good work mr hines
this movie is one of those wow movies not because the greatest movie of all time but because it surprised me not only was it a movie but it was on elvis i can safely say as many impersonators as there are there was only one elvis but i can also safely say that kurt russel came extremely close to being the real thing it was one of the greatest impersonations that i have ever seen he had me believing that it was really him i learned a lot about elvis life from watching this movie and don't led the television part of it let you actually a really fantastic film and kurt russel could've been elvis twin
this is an excellent show i had a us history teacher in high school that was much like this there are many facts in history that are not quite true and mr wuhl points them out very well in a way that is wuhl is teaching a class of film students but history students and even the general public will appreciate the witty way that he uncovers some very well known fallacies in the history of the world and strive to impress them upon that brains of his students use of live actors performing skits is also very entertaining highly recommend this series to anyone interested in having the history they learned as a child turned upside down
i was a little skepticle if i should watch this when it was first shown on cbs i was one of the many people who were in nyc on that day i was going to school at hunter college i didnt want to see all the devistation and carnage again but like many i was curious to see what this was all about tears came to my eyes watching this documentary all my memories returned and just the intense images were unbelievable i bought the dvd on the one year anniversary and watched it a few times how these guys were able to capture this footage was incredible if you have not seen this documentary do yourself a favor and check it out it is obviously depressing and will bring tears to eyes but an incredible document of this countries darkest hour
its a good thing i rented the movie before seeing the viewer rating from this site it was a wonderful movie that i will be adding to my christmas selection the cast was wonderfully chosen and ben affleck plays a good leading role i would tell viewers who have not seen the movie to go ahead and buy it i rate it right up there with christmas vacation the movie was very funny and well written and ben plays the eccentric rich executive very well the things he says and does is just how i would imagine a person with too much money to act the movie is much funnier than the santa claus and christmas with the kranks plus it has a good story line and teaches the true meaning of christmas which is you can't buy love with money
i thought this was one of the best movies i've seen in a very long time it was a great story line and showed that people are so intricate in all kinds of different ways have recommended it to all my friends i always enjoy a good story line and this movie had one of the best i've seen in a long time i could see myself having a daughter and doing the same things that natalie did to find out more about her life and loves it showed how we not only have lives with our families but also have parts of our lives that we don't share with them as it may not be in their best interest to know all the details of things we don't do that we are so proud look forward to another such movie and will keep my eye out
fear of a black hat is everything the weaker should have been rusty satirical eye is ruthless as he folds spindles and mutilates every aspect of hip-hop trends and culture does foabh resemble spinal tap yes a bit is it derivative of spinal tap no not really the aim is more focused the satire is better focused and to be honest funnier
this movie is such a moving amazing piece of work i saw it at the theater when it came out but i was only didn't really quite get it i saw it again when i was video of course i now own it was just blown away steven spielberg created a wonderful movie that keeps you wrapped up in it from beginning to end i have read the book as well but there is just something about the movie that really brings it to life the casting acting music costuming scenery everything it just wonderful you laugh you cry you cheer it brings out every emotion imaginable it is one of his finest pieces of work should not be missed
the movie itself was ok for the kids but i gotta tell ya that scratch the little squirrel was the funniest character i've ever seen he makes the movie all by himself the reason i've just love this movie congradulations to the crew it made me laugh out loud and always will
while the movie does feel a bit long at times it is well worth it gordon directs in a style that reminds you of vonneguts writing styles merciless thoughtful ironic quirky and dark this is a film which will stay with you for quite a while begging for answers to impossible questions nolte goodman and arkin are all incredible sheryl lee is wonderful as well in a role that will remind us lynch fans of her days do not miss this one
this movie draws you in and gets you hooked on keeping your eyes on the screen the is brilliant with the narrative parts and the use of creative and interesting camera angles and perspectives which all add to the gripping hold it will have on you nightmare is original and refreshingly different from any other movie you have seen is it a dream or reality this indie will have you discussing the twists and turns it takes through the conscious and subconscious it has an eery feel with dark interpretations of illusions dominic monaghan really became the insomniac he is a great actor who is not hard on the eyes either he really poured his whole being into this role from the storyline to the way it is shot makes this indie one of my favorites i recommend it highly and eagerly await to see more from this innovative creative
i haven't watched the movie yet but can't wait to see it it seems very interesting and inspirational it was one of the most interesting trailers i've ever seen the questions it posed really stopped me and made me think the unique approach to the sport of boxing as a metaphor for the battle within thank god somebody is hitting another angle with the boxing thing this film looks so fresh and smart and the actor is really hot i especially enjoyed the short clip with the actor from the rocky movies really clever i thought that the topic selected-overcoming adversities and childhood traumas-is timeless and god knows a lot of people need it bring it on
a cry in the dark is a masterful piece of cinema haunting and incredibly though provoking the true story of lindy chamberland who in witnessed a horrific sight seeing her baby being brutally taken from their tent while camping on the austrailian outback azaria baby was never seen again and the result of her horrendous disappearance caused a true life frenzy all around the world meryl streep does immaculate justice to the role of lindy as she always does but the one thing that helps a cry in the dark never fall flat is the brilliant direction a truly inspired and accurate outlook on this baffeling case tears are brought to the eyes the concept is nothing less then terrifying and afterwards you are left haunted but also inspired
excellent political thriller played much quieter and slower than other higher ranking films in this genre when people talk about pacino and cusack how do they manage to skip over these amazing career topping performances a story of friendships father-son relationships corruption and deceit the two actors gel amazingly well together and the supports from aiello and fonda are equally as impressive although aiello is brilliant especially when the papers run to press instead of focussing on an over complex corruption scandal it creates wonderful characters who show the human side of failure an political bribery the final scenes with each of the main characters are wonderfully written and acted
take this movie for what it is not a remake but a completely different approach to the same concept not an epic like the original more of a popcorn thriller visually incredible everything else was just ok what it is i think the movie is awesome but i like everything burton has done people need to calm down and stop acting like the end of the world of this movie it wasn't supposed to be a remake and not ending was cool i took it as a parallel universe
the invisible man is a show everybody s gotta love it reminds me of the old school the special effects are small but very effective but what is most important is the fun they had shooting this series it really shows the entire cast fit perfect in there roles and it looks like they can do whatever they want especially paul ben victor and vincent ventresca ventresca really shines in this one for me its unbelievable that an actor with so much sarcasm is his acting style doesn't get a shot in a big movie tarantino this was the show you should have directed instead of that major boring grave get this show if you can well worth it
maybe the movie itself isn't one of the best jackie movies but i think everybody will agree with me that the mall fight was one of the best fighting scenes ever made there also was some memorable stunts which were so impressive that they made this movie an action classic this movie influenced many other action movies and i think that nowadays action movie makers should learn from this film they could remake that chase scene i thing with modern technologies they could make it even better there also were some funny scenes which made this movie enjoyable even when jackie wasn't fighting althou i think they could put more fighting scenes in this film
people tend to complain about the number of films being made about mentally disabled people i don't see this as a valid criticism no more than complaints of too many films about any sort of people jaco van dormael does a wonderful job with the script and direction daniel auteuil and pascal duquenne work perfectly together with duquenne basically playing himself the film covers a surprisingly large ground of events and isn't simply content to go over what was seen in rain man the ending is rather depressing but it doesn't ruin the wonderful story that has come out of
i gotta say clive undying is by far the best horror game to have ever been made i've played resident evil silent hill and the evil dead and castlevania games but none of them have captured the pure glee with which this game tackles its horrific elements barker is good at what he does which is attach the horror to our world and it shows as his hand is clearly everywhere in this game heck even his voice is in the game as one of the main characters full of lush visuals and enough atmosphere to shake a stick at undying is the game to beat in my books as the best horror title i just wish that this had made it to a console system but alas poor pc sales nipped that one in the bud
funny how your life can change in a second to attend the waterdance for the first time it was an unforgettable experience the way you need to get used to a new way of life it can seem frightening and to notice that there are other people going by a similar situation it can help you to go on performances and mainly of helen hunt man helen is the purest and graceful woman in earth are wonderful wesley snipes also surprises in one of your last serious roles a film simple and at the same time deep that doesn't get to leave us indifferent to the message that is transmitted enjoy each moment of your to a film as that the any hour is not attended a brazilian expression
the opening sequence alone is worth the cost of admission as cheech and chong drag that big ol garbage can across the parking lot filled with gas don't spill it man hilarious stuff and then as the plot ensues you're in for one heck of a ride i watched this film recently and it holds up being just as funny upon each viewing check it out
i enjoyed still crazy more than any film i have seen in years a successful band from the decide to give it another try they start by playing some gigs in some seedy european venues with hilarious results the music is fantastic the script and acting are terrific the characters are spot on especially the lead singer with the high heavy metal voice makeup and personality problems the concert at the end was unreal go and see it preferably in a cinema with a good sound system
this is one of the more adorable episodes of the twilight zone with some fun dialog and amusing characters to break the tension of some creepy moments the usual blond vamp dancer is up with fondness for that kind of character such that she keeps showing up in various episodes and other assorted characters but jack old man who totally steals the show i consider this the funny light-hearted version of the monsters are due on maple street or perhaps a twilight zone parody of the thing on another note i thought the young lover of the episode might be someone who eventually went on to other things he looked familiar but it seems that ron kipling disappeared after just two tv credits to his name
do you like really inventive comedy or do you love the wedding crashers if the answer is the latter stop reading now i can't believe this movie is not higher rated basically meadows plays a character not unlike austin are so many inventive moments in this gagorama from crudity leon playing with himself on the porch the ex boyfriend tricked into eating oh well to inspired clown sex the broadway routine the voice over meadows is great as the childish but very sweet natured leon some great lines don't blame the wang freaky deaky sex world too many why this movie wasn't huge is a mystery great comedy
i loved this movie truly bizarre extremely funny morbid witty it makes no sense to tell about the contents of the movie because then i'd be giving out the outcome you have to see it without knowing what is it about everything is connected and has its why because it starts subtly and then the things start rolling faster and faster until they culminate in the most insane outburst you can imagine even more fun to watch the movie the second time once you know all the tricks the actors are excellent especially ivan trojan whose final scenes are a real master piece i highly recommend this film one of the most original ones i've ever seen
add paulie the parrot to beloved movie animal characters this movie is a love story bird and gena rowlands bird and beloved marie michael and marie a russian janitor helps a talking and thinking parrot find his rightful owner many years after parents sell him to a pawn shop before the heart warming ending we learn all the misadventures of paulie cheech marin and his dancing parrots are marvelous beautiful photography throughout great little movie word of mouth will make it a cult favorite
a bizarre and brilliant combination of talents between the director robert siodmak and ella raines as a secretary trying to save her boss from the electric chair by tracking down a mysterious phantom woman and franchot tone as a crazed and murderous sculptor as well there are some fascinating smaller parts played by elisha cook jr as a drugged out trap drummer as well as the other characters who make up parts of the conspiracy if you're used to seeing raines in more wholesome parts allowed to go overboard here especially in her scenes with cook franchot tone also plays someone very different and though it isn't a convincing part he acts phenomenally while the conspiracy is too contrived the film has real atmosphere and is very interesting
i saw saving grace right after it came out on video since then become one of my favorites the plot isn't particularly complex but it doesn't take away from the entertainment chuck full of comedic moments and has a very endearing quality to it the characters are what makes the movie so good they each have their own quirky qualities which adds to the humor the two old ladies played by linda kerr scott and phyllida law leaps to mind superb acting was done by all particularly brenda blythen she and craig ferguson were great together in pulling off some of the funnier moments if you're looking for a good comedy i'd definately recommend this movie
this movie is perfect for all the romantics in the world john ritter has never been better and has the best line in the movie sam hits close to home is lovely to look at and so much fun to play along with ben gazzara was an excellent cast and easy to fall in love with i'm sure i've met arthur in my travels somewhere all around an excellent choice to pick up any
i always tell people that enchanted april is an adult movie with no cussing no sex and no violence one might think of it as the ultimate chick flick but i bet there are one or two enlightened men out there who love it too don't invite the kids though this movie is very enchanted april is a very healing experience the sound track and gorgeous scenery along with the ladies gentle manners bring to mind the peace and beauty of a pre-raphaelite anyone think yours truly only watches one kind of movie i will paraphrase a line i heard once on saturday night live and say that my two favorite movies are the deer hunter and enchanted april
this film is mesmerizing in its beauty and creativity an profound vision his art that springs intuitively from its natural source brings us an inspiring hosanna blending his creations with trees white water dashing against rocks fields and goldsworthy makes the viewer feel joy in being alive aware that we are all made of the clay of this glorious earth he doesn't spare us his occasional frustration but on the whole we see the miracle in joining art with nature credit also goes of course to the filmmaker thomas riedelsheimer who directed photographed and edited the movie with incredible sensibility and perfect you have any feeling for beauty nature and not miss this fantastic film
to me this was colin farrells best movie evr he introduced himself to america through this movie and he was great he really got you into his charictor and made u feel the passion he was putting into his role in my opinion it is a great movie and my favorite
an nightmare is the story of a plunge into insanity having chronic insomnia jack is plagued by hallucinations causing him to try and determine what is real and what find out interesting things about jack near the end and think that by the time the movie is over we will have a happily ever after hollywood ending wrong this is new york city the place where nobody nanavati and director has herself a good film in an nightmare a talented filmmaker and writer made this film right after her high school graduation she has real potential and will be one to watch in the upcoming i watched this short film i was constantly uncomfortable between the music bleak scenery and realistic portrayal of an insomniac by dominic monaghan jack i desperately wanted to turn this off at times just to escape from it
any true wrestling fan would have to consider this wrestlemania to be one of if not the best of all time it was packed with excitement and surprises one of the greatest matches of all time was between shawn michaels and steve austin with special guest ref mike tyson the show that michaels put on was unbelievable especially considering the shape that his back was in and that this was his last match
just watched this after my mother brought it back from america for me was dreading watching this after all the negative comments on here but i have to say yes the acting is cheesy some of the effects are you have to remember this was meant to be not and for such a low budget i thought it was quite good i enjoyed this version much more then the spielberg version i saw last have read the book so many times and found myself going ahh yes in the book almost all the time with the other version hardly anything of the book well done for at least trying to make a true version
the first review i saw of page said what is madhur bhandarkar finally wants to say should he say something so most beautiful thing about page is it doesn't take sides no propaganda whatsoever this is the film that captures so many angles of an don't know what do i call as an issue here and yet like any mediocre movie doesn't come up with an solution i was so intrigued when i realized that the movie ended almost in the same scenario just like it movie defines so many characters who are completely with completely different priorities and different ideologies and yet they are all a part of the system which is all the more apathetic i wish i can say more but there would be more spoilers ahead so watch page if you wanna see one of the most mature films of the recent times
surreal film noir released soon after the real genre-defining classics the maltese falcon double indemnity and the postman always rings twice welles films shouldn't be evaluated against others he was playing by different rules in fact he was playing this starts where other femme fatale films leave off so the vaguely logical interesting whodunit is embellished with a display of wellesian scenes rapid-fire style dialog of hard-boiled philosophy and unusual acting hayworth presumably intentionally one-dimensional to welles genre may have meant formula but he seemed to like using mysteries as backgrounds for his entertainments
now this show looks like most of the other shows of type from the but the only thing is about this one is that different they use a lot of comedy and action in this one and maybe a little bit of drama too i personally thought it was a good show i can't understand why would they cancel it the good thing is that the fan base of this show is still alive ever since up to hopes is that the wb bring back the show or even do a movie which i know is gonna be impossible to do but hey it doesn't hurt to dream doesn't i would recommend if you hadn't seen it to find the dvd of all episodes because the characters are great the story lines are good the comedy is good and well the whole show is just great
any child old enough to sit up in front of a screen will be absolutely captivated by the beautifully drawn images and wonderful music in this heartfelt and humorous re-write of the grimms fairytale they'll be singing bibbity-bobbity-boo before they can even formulate a complete sentence and will continue singing it till their dying days it is a classic for all children especially those adults who are young at heart
this is the best chinese movie i have ever seen and in my opinion a lot better than hero or chrouching tiger hidden dragon the movie is a unique combination of several genres a beautiful love story action movie comedy and horror at the same time and the most amazing thing is that it really succeeds in all of movie definitely makes it to my top and should be enjoyable to every movie lover the action sequences do have the traditional unrealistic jumping and even flying but the way shot differs from the style of hero a lot and the flying always looks great and usually even makes sense can this movie you won't regret it
this movie is an amusing and utterly sarcastic view of pop culture and the producers thereof i was impressed with the photography that consisted of vivid colors and spin doctored settings especially when you think that this is first large scale warning do not take the message that seriously it is not for mass consumption and that is not a compliment the message is a somewhat stylized post-college neophyte view of did enjoy the basic plot line of a fictitious zine editor verbally whipping the mobocracy of the
the little girl desi is so adorable i cant think of a more beautiful story then this one here it will make you cry laugh and believe knowing that this was based on a true story just made me gasp and it also made me realize that there are nice people out there great cast and an overall great movie
i watch this movie all the time i've watched it with family ages to and everyone in between they all loved it it really shows the true scenes a dog has and the love and loyalty you get from a pet just great for thoes who love comedy movies the tear-jerker movies or even just music is wonderful the animals spectacular the scenes truly thought out and the characters perfect what i liked about the characters is the true and nicely mixed personalities shadow oldest a golden retriever the wise one filled with the wisdom and mindset of any dog chance american bulldog puppy is basically a puppy with a witty side the comical character and sassy hymilayan cat the real cat who shows what a real cat will do for their owner the real girly one
i used to watch this show when i was a little girl although i don't remember much about it i must say that it was a pretty good show also i don't think i've seen every episode however if you ask me it was still a good show i vaguely remember the theme song everyone was ideally cast the costume design was great the performances were top-grade too i just hope some network brings this series back one day so that i'll be able to see every episode before i wrap this up i'd like to say that i'll always remember this show in my memory forever even though i don't think i've seen every episode now in conclusion when and if this show is ever brought back on the air i hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good
jeanette macdonald and nelson eddy star in this modern musical that showcases comic abilities surreal musical seem to be making fun of fashions even as they were in current vogue eye-popping costumes and sets add to the surreal dreamlike quality of the entire film several good songs enliven the film with the twinkle in your eye number a total highlight including a fun jitterbug number between macdonald and binnie barnes also in the huge cast are edward everett horton reginal owen mona maris douglas dumbrille and anne jeffreys also to been seen in extended bit parts are esther dale almira sessions grace hayle gertrude hoffman rafaela ottiano odette myrtile cecil cunningham and many fun and nice to see the wonderful macdonald in her routines she could do it all
i saw the movie before i read the michelle magorian book and i enjoyed both the movie more than the book made me come close to tears on several occasions this film touches the deepest points of the human soul and never lets go i encourage as many people to watch this masterpiece as much and as soon as possible i give it ten stars
the only time i have seen this movie was when i was years old i have remembered it all of these years as i couldn't sleep for a week or more after seeing it it just absolutely rattled me i was on vacation with my aunts in ft worth texas and i will never forget it now years later my daughter is trying to get a copy of this for me to view as an adult it has taken a lot of research to find out what movie it was but i always remembered that barbara stanwyck was in it and finally was able to get the name and reviews on it i very much enjoyed it but it gave me quite a scare jaqui
govind directorial venture of vijay novel is brilliant om puri plays an inspector velankar who is forced to protect underworld don rama shetty played brilliantly by sadahiv amrapurkar this is govind most talked about movie this is a very good and a classic film smita patil plays the female lead opposite om puri naseeruddin shah is brilliant in a cameo role although sadashiv amrapurkar has only scenes in the movie he dominates the movie this was sadashiv amrapurkars acting puri won a national award for this film for the best actor filmfare award winner for best amrapurkar

got to be one of the best political satires i have seen to date with an excellent performance for cusak tomei and all the supporting plot very well-placed and a very good unexpected twist at the end the action scenes were well filmed choreographed very in all i give this film a big thumbs up extremely critical of us military intervention in the middle-east and as such it may receive bad reviews from people who don't share the same political view or those who are simply too politically ignorant to appreciate the dark and drk humour indeed at places the comedy was so close to the truth that it was borderline between funny and tragic
i have to start off by apologizing because i thought the first of this film was hilarious mostly because of brad performance spot acting by all involved was quite good but brad stole the movie the atmosphere was perfect in all respects i'm not a giant pitt fan but this has got to be one of his best roles all good words to describe this was reading a previous review and the person said that the reasoning behind violence isn't explained it is explained but they thankfully don't have to go into graphic detail to get their point i gave this a because every scene bar or was effective i think the humor in the first half or so is perfect for this movie underrated
that was great fun i never read those chester-gould-comics but not necessary to know them maybe there were some inside jokes i didn't figure out but what the eye doesn't see the heart cannot grieve over this is such an ironic colourful film and the actors are good-humoured all together the setting is similar to that in the movies but not as dark and grey okay the story is not so original but there is a plot is not self-evident and a more or less surprising this movie you could play an interesting game if you watch it with friends don't watch the credits at the beginning and then look the fastest to find out who are the famous actors under their make-up
if you like you have no idea what you're missing if you haven't seen this film yet this movie is crazy hilarious and incorporates a lot more about the hip hop industry than any other parody movie it is unfortunate that this movie has not been released on dvd because it is one movie that everybody i've ever watched it with has loved and wanted a copy if you really want a good laugh and you like hip hop and are a little familiar with some old-school performers definitley rent this movie there aren't that many video rental places that have copies of it but if you happen to come across one you will not be disappointed
the first thing i thought after watching mystery men was how could this movie be so unpopular i found this movie so adorable and funny that status as a bomb defies logic well i hope that in the future it becomes a cult hit and you can count me amoung put and without giving too much away this movie does for comic books what the princess bride did for fairy tales and who framed roger rabbit did for classic cartoons that should give you a more accurate idea of the tone of the movie then the marketing commitee it was unfortunately signed to is one of those cases like the iron giant where the studio had no clue what it had on hands rent it the next time you're in the mood for something a little offbeat you won't listen to the beegees in the same light ever again
being a person who does not usually enjoy boxing movies feeling they only focus on the boxing and not the characters themselves this movie truly moved me i loved being able to see the main character rodriguez go through so many things in such a short while it was amazing to me michelle did such a wonderful job playing diana especially since this was her first acting experience she showed true emotion and portrayed diana wonderfully all actors had chemistry on screen and made this movie even more amazing i highly recommend this movie even to those who do not usually watch boxing movies
quite simply the best reality show ever made the first two seasons only ones that matter are on hulu i challenge anyone to watch the first three episodes of season and not like it i guarantee you will finish watching the season then i guarantee that you will watch season quick reasons to watch it anderson cooper is hilarious the locations in europe are awesome the games are mentally challenging very interactive in one episode a player responds to another desperate i'm trying as hard as i can with an equally desperate not necessarily you figure is the mole
human tornado is in many ways a better film than predecessor the director knew what he had to work with and catered towards rudy ray limitations as an actor a fun movie more technically sound and acted the performers don't take themselves too seriously and it seems that this time around everyone is on the joke and goes with the flow rudy ray moore seems more relaxed in front of the camera and not as stiff like he was in enjoyed the film very much and i highly recommend it just like his first film catered towards a certain audience highly doubt that mr moore was trying to broaden his audience at this point in his career check it recommended
certain elements of this film are dated of course an all white male crew for instance and like most pre-star wars science fiction it tends to take too long admiring still no movie has ever capture the flavor of golden age science fiction as this one did even down to the use of the electronic tonalities to provide the musical score robbie the robot epitomized the asimov robots and was the inspiration for all that followed from to plot line of course is the tempest morbius is prospero and exiled wizard who finds his kingdom invaded by interlopers it was a movie that treated science fiction as an adult genre perhaps the first
there are plenty of reviews on this page that will explain this details far more eloquently than i could but i would like to offer a simple review for those who occasionally go to the movies for more than entertainment raising victor vargas is so true you will believe it this flick gets inside your head
one shot one kill no exceptions a must see if you are into marines or snipers two big thumbs up great overall storyline great camera work good drama action details and more pretty close to the real thing but this isn't a film to breakdown and pick out the editing faults this is to sit back and have a good mins the plot has some depth but this movie isn't really about making you think its about enjoying the sniper lifestyle and action sniper and are pretty good follow ups but the first is still the best overall movie tom berenger does a great job playing his character and showing the hidden side of the sniper life the plain of dealing with all of the death must see for sniper fans
i thoroughly enjoyed the first part of this two parter the impossible planet and was slightly worried that the second part wouldn't hold up quite so well as has been true in the past of the two parters of the past who series but thankfully my fears were unfounded as i found myself enjoying this episode as much as the previous one anyway we start off with the surviving crew members on the run from the ood whom have become the pawn there is also a bit of philosophizing on the part in the episode that i quite enjoyed needless to say it was a good solid doctor who story might be a tad too intense for the younger viewers grade
i was years old when this movie premiered on the television being raised in texas i understood the boredom monotony of teenage life there this movie touched my impressionable teenage heart i remembered it fondly through the past years i recently got to see it for the times thanks the the love channel i still cry because the movie reaches in touches my inner confused teenager
i went to see this movie expecting a nice relaxing time in the theater with my younger sister instead i had to really control myself in order to convince her that i was not scared in many ways still a story but with a screenplay that has a lot of potential could have been one of the scariest movies if planned for another audience
part of the enjoyment that i took from this film stemmed from the fact that i knew nothing more about it than that it starred john turturro and emily watson reasons enough to watch was a period piece and involved chess everything that evolved before me was completely unexpected i shan't therefore give away much more suffice to say that turturro is magnificent as an eccentric obsessive and deeply vulnerable chess genius and em matches him step for step as the strong-minded woman who is drawn to him about love and obsession rather than the venerated board game and after drawing me in gradually over the first half hour became totally compelling and i defy anyone to second-guess the ending
closet has the emotional power of kramer vs kramer combined with the imagination of labyrinth even the beginning special effect seems to give a nod to labyrinth but this is a story that takes place in modern times not in a war sixty years ago and in that way it has even more resonance today closet is about a boy an only child practically alone on summer vacation dealing with his family falling apart a horror movie like the others and the sixth sense a horror movie for the thinking person if you're looking for a slasher movie this won't be your cup of tea but if you're looking for a story that is both touching and suspenseful with good acting this is the movie for you at the screening i saw i swear there was one moment where the entire audience screamed i highly recommend catching this film
there is a certain genius behind this movie i was laughing throughout the scene in the phone sex office discussing how love heals the doppelganger was a nice attempt at this execution is poor but you can see the message and they do have some talent the doppelganger split at the end was like ok wasn't quite expecting that but see what the movie has to say certainly ridiculous but a sweet idea and actually very coherent to the story in a strange the point of a movie to be logical or is it to be entertaining or communicate on an emotional level i'm easily bored by many movies but this one kept my interest think the story may have some auto-biographical roots but just a guess horribly bad but good i'm looking for other movies this person may have done more experience

the story has been told before a deadly disease is spreading around but the extra in this film is peter weller his interpretation of muller on the run is real he is indeed a desperate person just going home to see his child this person could be working next to you
kureishi hasn't exactly been blessed with movies that justify the quality of his writing recent adapted like intimacy have ruined great writing but the mother surpasses all his previous incarnations eclipsing even my beautiful laundrette a middle-aged woman overcomes widow-hood by having a very carnal relationship with the boyfriend of her emotionally-weak daughter the fact that you believe all this is credit to the quality of the acting as it is to the finite gift of the writing and in daniel craig we have a strutting brash gruff anti-hero who denies the audience to ever question why a young stud would contemplate bedding a sagging grandmother beautifully shot the film fails only in the weak depiction of the peripheral characters but as a study of inconceivable lust a winner
as a kid i loved computer animation although it was extremely limited and the tools were almost nonexistent this movie as i sat in awe and watched the amazing images and almost-hypnotic music shaped the desire in me to create moving things in the computer this is a whole-package deal between the music and the video that really packs a one-two punch if you know any child that wants to get involved in computer animation this is a must have still almost years later rate this movie as one of my top favorites the originality i think is still unsurpassed by most of mcmovies that hollywood spits out i am currently wanting to see if i can re-make it on my own if imitation is the sincerest form of flattery then this movie deserves a ton of imitation
everything a musical comedy should be gene kelly joe brady doesn't miss a step and frank sinatra clarence doolittle doesn't miss a note scenes with them together are very good showing how much talent can add to a somewhat uneven plot i fall in love too easily is an indication of his then and future best mexican hat dance with a young mexican girl is delightful kelly certainly earned his nomination as best actor and there is a bushel of truly funny lines like you think the navy takes dopes you think anybody sings a sailor to sleep and we got in a little trouble we picked up a little kid a thoroughly enjoyable movie just the thing for shaking off the dust of a recently concluded world war ii
for my humanities quarter project for school i chose to do human trafficking after some research on the internet i found this dvd and ordered it i just finished watching it and i am still thinking about it all i can say is wow it is such a compelling story of a year old vietnamese girl named holly and an american man named patric who tries to save her the ending leaves you breathless and although not a happily-ever-after ending it is very realistic it is amazing and i recommend it to anyone you really connect with holly and patric and your heart breaks for her and because of what happens to her i loved it so much and now i want to know what happens next
i really liked this version of vanishing point as opposed to the version i found the version quite boring if i can get up in the middle of a movie a few i did with the version than to me it is not all that great of course this could be due to the fact that i was only nine at the time the version was brought out however i have seen many remakes where i have liked the original and older one better i found that the plot of the version was more understandable and had basically kept true to the original without undermining the meaning of the version in my opinion i felt the version had more excitement and wasn't so
this film was really eye-opening i have seen this film several times first when i was four and i actually remembered it and then when i was the whole message that the director is conveying is for everyone to wake up and not make the mistake of leaving god out of our everyday lives or just plain going the extra mile to insult great movie for non-believers and believers alike
i began watching a replay of this tv movie on a sunday afternoon thinking it was just another dumb airplane disaster flick i was clock is an intelligent political thriller that is far beyond the quality of most tv movies it could just as easily have made its debut on the big cast is excellent including veteran actors richard dean anderson edward herrmann robert guillaume and robert loggia daphne zuniga turns in one of her best performances as a medical specialist working for the cia and jane leeves is also very good dialogue is well-written and the story is compelling throughout in fact the final hour is so filled with plot twists and suspense that you can't leave your seat for a second if you get a chance to see this movie invest the time nearly four hours you will be richly rewarded
jeff wincott is not only a hunk he can kick butt this movie has some of the best martial arts moves i've seen in a very long time ok so maybe bridgette nielson isn't the first person i'd hire to play a ruthless politician she did a great job nontheless and not forget that wincott has a partner in this movie played by martial arts karen sheperd so not cynthia rothrock who cares just as good if not better check out her fight scene at the end of the movie one word ouch my suggestion would be to buy this movie as soon as possible because if you haven't seen it you're really missing out on some great martial arts action
i live in missouri so the direct effects of terrorism are largely unknown to me this brought it home that two men would put themselves on the line in the way that those members of fdny and nypd did just to document the horror that unfolded on that day this film is a testament to those who lost their lives and the true evil that terror brings
this is so to say a sequel to batman the animated and it is pretty much as good as it to and for all the same reasons it has lots of action in it the storyline to it is good the voice over actors are really good such as kevin conroy as batman mark hamil as the joker etc the villains are really good such as the joker two-face catwoman clayface etc so i am sure you will not be disappointed with the new adventures of batman because it is really good so make sure that you watch it on tv or rent or buy the collectors edition because it is really score out of out of
franco proves once again that he is the prince of surreal erotic cinema true much of his work can be viewed as entertaining sleaze but with succubus he shows what he is truly capable of when he lets his warped creativity run riot and gives us a film that is both hypnotic and enigmatic whilst still maintaining the delirious eroticism intrinsic in his work jerry van splendid score pulsates as the viewer is thrown from one bizarre scenario to another as we follow the trials of a striptease artist who may be schizophrenic or may indeed one mysterious character states be a devil attempt to come to terms with the world she inhabits a beautiful and enigmatic piece of cinema highly recommended to anybody with even a passing interest in alternative cinema
after beau travail everybody was waiting for claire denis to make a follow-up masterpiece that never arrived now it has denis makes a quantum leap in this film an orgy of gorgeous cinematography elliptical editing and willfully obscure narrative events that feels strange and acts even stranger a nominal plot partly from the jean-luc nancy book of the same name about a mature man in need of a heart transplant and who seeks a tahitian son he abandoned long ago but mostly an exploration of the idea of intrusions personal and cultural it takes a couple of viewings to fully comprehend and has pacing problems close to the end but still more advanced and gripping than anything else i've seen this year miss it at your peril
eric valette is obviously a talented film-maker and so are the two guys who wrote the script therefore maléfique is a great flick made with just a few bucks but also tons of imagination well i'm a bit exaggerating but nevertheless i'm sincere so if you like dark gory movies go and see this one really worth it
sammo has to have a out of for this movie as it has everything great story great fights great characters and great film sees dick wei take on billy chow and chong fat sammo takes on lau kar leung in a casino sammo loses the fight but what a fight it is full of high tempo action and elements of comedy thrown great and touching moments in the film lam ching ying pops up in a cameo and gets killed off end sequence will have you reaching for the rewind button as its one of the best end fights i've seen sammo takes on loads of guys and ends up squaring up to billy chow
i never met a single person of hundreds who hated this movie bet that anyone who votes it down is a petty saboteur or a victim of one this film has everything ask yourself are you a fan of then go see not my favorite movie but my favorite is directed by the same person miyazaki in any case this one ranks among my top five and i've seen a lot of movies
pleasant diverting and charming the best part is the swing numbers especially the rendition of my buddy partial though it may have been the acting was a bit over the top in areas but the mood set by wilder is so pleasant it is hard not to enjoy this film
i found this to be a charming adaptation very lively and full of fun with the exception of a couple of major errors the cast is wonderful i have to echo some of the earlier comments chynna phillips is horribly miscast as a teenager at just too old yes it does show and lacks the singing chops for broadway-style music vanessa williams is a decent-enough singer and for a non-dancer adequate however she is not latina and her character definitely is also very strident throughout which gets girls of sweet conrad birdie fan club really sparkle with special kudos to brigitta dau and chiara zanni i also enjoyed tyne performance though i'm not generally a fan of her work finally the dancing shriners are a riot especially the dorky three in the movie is suitable for the whole family and i highly recommend it
i finally watched these episodes in and i had to continually go back and verify when they were actually produced they are absolutely scary in that they made spot on fun of what would be the future either parker and stone lived in texas and witnessed the idiocy of gov bush or they are those weird eerie people that pay attention to things boo scary frat bros invading the white house dressed as arabs wielding rifles bush accidentally executing someone wait he did sort of do that as gov this may have seemed a failure as a sitcom at the time but must now be considered as brilliant if spooky prescience
i think this show is screamingly funny not for every taste and i'm not going to elevate or denigrate the folks that don't get it i'm sure they're wonderful bright people that operate at a different wavelength but if you like it you really like it sarah plays a self-infatuated loser named sarah silverman who often finds her self in homerian predicaments homerian as in homerian remember sarah silverman from her brief gig on saturday night live in the early i liked her immediately then and i go out of my way to check out anything show is choke-on-your-food-and-wet-your-pants funny therefore i always fast before watching it and wear adult diapers check it out
this is one of the shallowest episodes in that the plot really seemed like an excuse to just have fun but i appreciated this light-hearted approach and this is truly one of the best episodes to see on a purely fun level think about crew members have encounters with the white rabbit and alice from wonderland a bengal tiger a samurai warrior a knight on horseback who kills mccoy and a host of other seemingly bizarre events that just don't make any sense at all until the very end despite all the danger you just can't take everything very just too fun and the whole episode seems very surreal so on a purely non-aesthetic level great stuff
i really love this movie saw it again last week after years or so this movie is perfect great acting great story great it is a gift to show it to someone you love too bad jaco van dormael did not make more movies after this one top work years and days later then the comment above it was never posted because it was not more than lines anyway i saw le huitieme jour again yesterday this is with no doubt in my movie top together with cinema paradiso which is also a masterpiece the soundtrack is also really good i am really curious about jaco von new movie i hope it will complete my movie top if you see this movie rent it or even better buy it because you will want to see it again
the night listener is probably not one of best roles but he makes a very interesting character in a somewhat odd but very different movie i can guarantee you that you have never seen this kind of movie before some people maybe won't like the slow pacing of this movie but i think the great plus of the movie it is definitely one of the top movies that have come out the year it has a intriguing performance in a movie with a great content dramatic feeling this is no americanized movie neither is it a predictable movie you just feel that it is a movie that has secrets which you have a hard time to determine what the outcome of it may be this is no excellent movie that has everything but hell a damn good and very original movie
the man in the white suit is another feather in the cap of expert scottish director alexander mackendrick galore sweet smell of success the star of the film is alec guinness comedies include kind hearts and coronets and the lavender hill mob guiness brings his usual class to the film and makes it much more than a typical fact the comedy isn't entirely overt by the end of the picture nearly become a complete drama the sort of ealing studio comedy that is calculated not to produce laughter but a sense of general amusement like the best british comedy of the whole idea of the suit isn't very original but the way it is executed is the film is highly original and recommended to any fan of guiness or britsh out of
one of funniest eugene levy is great in this one as well just wish the studio would figure out that this one needs to be on dvd i have it on video tape but feel that this film deserves dvd extras would be great the kung fu uuniversity fu u skit is so very funny as is the entire film also the scenes he has with his girlfriend and her family are great this movie never seems to be on tv but it loses most of hilarity when edited for broadcast tv if you can find the video i would suggest you buy it is a good place to find a copy i will keep my vhs until one day we get to see it on dvd there are so many great movies out there that still have not been released to dvd and this is one of them
saw this movie at the rotterdam iff you may question some decisions of the maker like choosing a mockumentary form for such a sensitive and horrible subject but this movie sure hits you in the gut especially the last scenes were almost painful to watch hope it gets the distribution it deserves
true it does not follow the book very closely but still a very entertaining take on the story swayze was far better in the role than i expected and doody avoided the silly woman out of her depth in the wilderness portrayal most of us probably expected kate capshaw in indiana jones the temple of any rate amazingly better than richard awful pair of quatermain is very reminiscent of a western in many ways about the only thing i didn't care for was all the mysticism but i guess that is part and parcel of the genre like how can you have an african adventure story without witch doctresses and preternaturally wise wandering tribesmen heh
this is the ultimate one-man show in which eddie murphy is at his very best just forget the nutty professor and the distinguished gentlemen this is the real eddie murphy his imitations of mr t he is gay michael jackson and other artists are killers i think also quite daring to make fun of artists who where really popular in that time my favorite act is the one where he is at his annual bbq with the family and plays his drunken dad and aunt bunny who falls from the show is the best medicine when you feel down if you watch the sequel raw don't be disappointed quite good too but doesn't match delirious
this movie is brilliant in every way it touches on the complexities of loving relationships in a meaningful way but never lectures the script never condescends toward any character not even the hapless johnny it also and benefits from spot-on direction production design casting and performances the fact that cher is so perfect in the film and is more unlike cher than she has ever been is a wonder to me i watch moonstruck at least once a year and i just viewed it again this christmas eve with my year old twin daughters and they loved it as well it has something for everyone with a heart and leaves you filled with joy in the end
attractive in fear after being accosted by a lone biker she is mortally shaken with the fact her attacker knows her address as expected russo the attacker forces his way into home and subjects her to humiliating terror bruised and bloody marjorie manages to get an upper hand on her attacker knocking the living daylights out of the jerk and renders him helpless thanks to wasp spray in his eyes and throat hog tied and battered himself joe tries to explain himself to scarwid and alfrie woodard when they get home there is almost a hint of mercy but it is not coming from marjorie should she continue to render her own punishment violence sexual abuse and rough language makes for an r rating fawcett really gets away from the ditsy roles that would forever stain her career kudos to director robert m young
this is a really funny film especially the second third and fourth time you watch it a pretty short film and i definitely recommend watching it more than once you will get it more the second like spinal tap but the rap version it has a lot of attitude in it which can be a negative thing in rap influenced films but just a total take and isn't a problem because of the irony it of stand-out bits one of those types of films which you will find yourself quoting lines with your mates and it will raise personal favourite part is the guerrillas in the midst section great video superb
love the characters and the story line very funny with plenty of action thomas ian griffith and tia carrer give great performances i enjoyed the dynamic and comical interaction of griffith and career donald southerland plays a very likable and surprisingly sympathetic burnt out hit man all three actors are among my favorites and having them in this movie made for a special treat a nice addition to my extensive dvd collection i highly recommend this movie if you like mr and mrs smith the replacement killers confidential the long kiss goodnight the abyss and the whole nine yards you will love this movie
saw this movie twice at community screenings and really loved it i work in the jane finch community and feel the film really captured some of the essence and flavour of the community grit determination exuberance creativity in your faceness with a dose of desperation the writing dialogue and acting is solid and i really found myself drawn into the story of the young woman raya as she struggles to pursue her goals and not lose herself in the process great dance sequences and it is not only the bodies that move smoothly and with electricity but the camera moves with great fluidity and intelligence as well all the characters are multi dimensional none wholly good or bad and the women characters are admirably strong this is a film that has a strong beating heart and celebrates the irrepressible spirit of youth hip hop and communities like jane finch
this is an excellent stand-up dvd eddie izzard is the funniest person i have seen in years his routine is hilarious and makes for great conversation with others who have seen it i highly recommend this one the part about the history of europe is a bit slow but the ending jokes in french are quite good because you don't have to speak french to get it if you do it is still hilarious also the parts about being a transvestite are quite good the first scene san francisco is not great but funny the first time skip over those if you can almost not worth watching however this really is a funny funny stand-up show that everyone should see i was dead at the time
i voted excellent for how well the acting was not for the content it still gives me chills after reading the book then watching the movie two ex-cons are traveling to their destination to rob a family of money from a safe one of the cons learned about while in prison during the ride the tension begins to mount as the soundtrack in the movie adds to the overall anticipation after the killers are done with their work at the farm the following morning the remains are found by the church friend the blood-curdling scream as the scene pans onto the telephone with the cut cord really made my blood run cold and gave me chills that the killers met their just fates is a small comfort for this doomed family robert blake was excellent in his portrayal of perry smith the book was also excellently written by truman capote
other reviewers have summarized this film noir well i just wanted to add to the whew comment one reviewer made regarding elisha obviously coke-fuelled drumming episode this was a doozy i must say cook deserved some acclaim for his frenzied bit of trivia that i am surmising about cook appeared as a waiter in the barbara stanwyck film ball of fire he was a waiter in the nightclub where barbara was singing and legendary drummer gene krupa was drumming most energetically is it too much to suggest that spazzy drumming in the later film phantom lady was very much inspired by work as witnessed by cook years earlier you watch krupa in ball of fire i think you'll note some clearly similar body movements one hopes of course that he was not influenced by any drugs at the time
and that goes especially for lawyers cops puerto boasts of a potent film production this multi layered tale of to the on going drug cartel that starts in south a pit stop on the island then northbound into north america steven most recognizable face on screen a cast of top notch a story of can you spot the only respectable face in the crowd ricardo mendez matta moves up from directing mainly action adventure fare for american a screenplay written by with poli marichal the rest of the cast maria mention a in oh so fine a film that will keep you wondering is there any respectable characters here spoken in spanish with english subtitles rated r by the film contains outbursts of vulgar flashes of content of which is quite lurid
made me think about it for days after seeing it that to me is the mark of a great movie eyes wide shut had the same effect on me i am tired of these people requiring these happy hollywood cookie-cutter endings i am planning on going to see it again tonight to understand the plot a little better but regardless the emotional messages of the movie were totally felt
a wonderful free flowing often lyrical film that whisks you along ever smiling even if there are truly shocking incidents along the way one gasps at the way the women are treated and yet ultimately they seem to come through very well and it is much credit to all concerned that so many potentially disastrous scenes all work so very well this is possibly best performance certainly his most natural jeanne moreau performs outstandingly in what must have been a very difficult role to play and including vigorous sex scenes with a couple of guys at least half her age miou-miou is lovely throughout and again has very difficult scenes to play initially this seems a down and dirty misogynist but as the tale and characters unfold a much more tender and honest picture emerges in the end this uncompromising and daring film demands respect
i thought that for a first episode of a first series it did really well it was really fun and i thought the actors was brilliant i think it is a crime for anyone to say that is was bad because it looked the right time i find it really annoying when people say that it wasn't historically correct because it is supposed to be a saturday night entertainment show not a boring history documentary so i think the costumes and settings were just right a brilliant start and i am going to love what will come next i have spoken to many people at my school and they love the show we all think that it is brilliant entertainment and it has great stories to go with it
in i was a boy of years old my parents had just got the home box office which was pretty new to our neighborhood as a year old boy this was the first time i saw boobs on television i will never forget the joy of those times racing vans the total ass-wipe with the baddest van the water bed the smoking of herbs the hot chicks the makin love in my chevy van song it was all so new to me a complete movie with all of the memories you could hope for i own it and enjoy it about once a year when i watch this movie it makes me want to get my skates with wheels not in a strait line go to the park and hunt down some babes with feathered hair truly great memories of young adolescence
i love the movie it was a very interesting fantasy movie of the real meaning of family in it the history of our country the fun-filled action displayed in the movie i watch time the top about a week and i just love it i wish that a sequel had of been made to see more of dad in the past and watching how susan delt with her new baby sister and having no telephone computers gameboys or anything of the century i hope everyone else enjoyed the movie as much as i did i guess you could say i'm a time at the top fanatic and i don't mind the lil boy in the movie robert lincoln walker was simply adorible i wonder who he is and how old he is today does anyone know if played in over movies or tv shows
i saw this movie in when it was first released at the cameo theater on south beach now the famous crowbar night-club it was the last year of the wild and this movie really hit home got everything the generation gap the sexual revolution the quest for success and the conflict between following family traditions to those of seeking ones own way through was a fast paced highly enjoyable movie vegas was at hippiest peak sin city in all glory beautiful women famous cameos laughs conflict romance and even a happy ending a very enjoyable time over all poster from this film rests on my bedroom wall i look at it and i go back in time a time of my youth and my times with my dad a great time in my life
i love buying those cheap lousy from alpha video one day i happened to buy this one the perfect silly science fiction film of the all sexed up replete with unscientific everything scantily clad girls and plenty of melodrama an enjoyable film to those who appreciate this kind of stuff and if you can suspend your disbelief enough you can actually get creeped not just by the psychotic head or by the beating of the thing in the closet but toward the end with the character of the perfect body so another word for
the film revolves around a man who believes that all forms of media are obsolete the idea behind his art project is to unmask the ridiculous culture that we are bathed in naturally the film takes place in los county he attacks stand up comics caw caw rock bands models blockbuster hollywood films and touches on many other mediums eventually he finds himself in the sights of the weapon he has set into motion the film is five years old and rings more true every day the best description of post-punk anger i've ever seen also one of my top favorite films
its not as good as the first its a good solid movie its has good car chase the remake of this movie there a story for are hero to drive fast as his trying to rush to the side of his ailing ending is great just a good fair movie to watch in my
spoiler this is a great film about a conure he goes through quite the ordeal trying to get back to his little girl owner he learns a lot through his journey and meets up with a lot of other beautiful birds if you love birds like my wife does this film is for you this film also has some sad parts that make the tears run in the end it all works out for paulie and his russian friend rent this for the whole family everyone will enjoy this
outrage is pretty good movie robert culp was very good in the movie and was perfect for the part its hard to believe that this is a true story but what can you do when i watched this i thought why do they have to do all of those things it isn't right but they learned their lesson when they picked on the wrong man anyway if you ever see this movie on tv watch it because its a good one
amazing grace has a languid feel to it as it tells a contemporary story of various lives in an apartment building the language spoken is hebrew but the drama could take place in any modern city it observes family values romantic relationships and age group characteristics with equal aplomb it does not judge the characters only present them in a straight forward manner as they strive to work out their individual problems in this modern world the quality of acting is very good and the observations made on the characters are astute and sharp i appreciate this flowing film very much
for a no budget movie this thing rocks i don't know if gonna like it but we were laughing all the way through some really funny funny stuff really actors and music rocked the cars and gags and even the less in your face stuff cracked us up whooo seen some of the actors before but never in anything like this one or two of them i think i've seen in commercials or in something somewhere basically it rocked luckily i got to see a copy from a friend of one of the actors
this is one of the best comedy ever the writing of this parody of soap is brilliant and the cast well just look at the names of the cast and you'll understand why it is so great if you're a kevin kline fan he does always an fantastic performance and robert downey jr is perfect if you don't laugh while seen this movie you don't have any sense of humor
clean family oriented movie i laughed i loved it i was worried i wouldn't be able to see steve carrell as anything but goofy michael from the office boy was i wrong he should win an oscar for his performance i will definitely buy this on dvd when it comes out my husband enjoyed it and he isn't into movies of this type i saw it with other couples in the year old range and we all agreed it was the best movie we had seen in a long time and certainly the cleanest only cuss word not even sure why it was i would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes comedy drama romance and more
this show started out with great mystery episodes i think everyone is in the first or episodes after that the show started playing short episodes with shaggy scooby doo and scrappy think hanna barbera productions had to change minutes episodes into short episodes some of the voice actors became unavailable after or episodes frank welker played fred became unavailable i think the voice of velma changes after first episodes because the first voice actress who played velma was the network ordered the hanna barbera studio to make more shorts with shaggy scooby doo and scrappy doo because the ratings were high so they had to make more shorts i wish they were mysteries like episodes still it is a good show
i have one word to someup this movie wow i saw darius goes west at the tribeca film festival people in the theater were sobbing this movie shows the hardships that darius sufferes with muscular dystrophy the movie was very well done and really made you part of the movie i was so emotionally moved by the movie because it made us remember that we are very fortunate to be perfectly healthy some people in this world are less fortuate then us and sometimes we should give them a had and help them to the very end i would give them ten stars they gave darius a had when they weren't asked to they did't do it for the money they did it for a friend in need darius the world should know darius went west
alain chabat claims this movie as his original idea but the theme of reluctant lovers who finally get it together is as old if not older than is a vieux garcon happily single and not wanting any member of the opposite sex to disturb his life he has a problem sisters and a matriarchal mum the who decide he should be married enter the delightful charming charlotte gainsbourg and what should be a simple plan charlotte has to pose as girlfriend and then simply not turn up on the day of the wedding no more talk of marriage from the of course the best laid plans have a habit of spiralling out of are very strong supporting roles from lafont as the mother and osterman as the tight-fisted brother of are some fantastic scenes as first charlotte has to charm then revolt the family french farce with an english
never viewed this film and enjoyed the singing and dancing by cagney and the other cast members namely dick powell blair who had a great tenor voice and ruby keeler thorn james cagney plays the role as chester kent who writes musicals and eventually goes into producing prologues which are shown in between the feature films shown in movie during the chester has trouble with people trying to steal his ideas for his shows this is a very entertaining film with lots of comedy and plenty of laughs joan blondell prescott gave a great supporting role who was also very young and pretty dick powell was great as a singer and dancer and just starting out with his long and successful screen career enjoy
if you haven't seen eva longoria from the tv show desperate house wives then you are missing out eva is going to be one of the biggest latina stars and you'll be seeing her in the theaters soon this was first film and she does a fantastic job acting she was when she shot it and looked hot then as for this low budget film pretty good for the first time director who has another soon to be released movie juarez mexico currently playing at many film festivals across the united states in fact it appears that it may have a limited theatrical release from some news what would be nice to see is a with a higher budget
gone in seconds is a very good action comedy film that made over million but got blasted by most critics i personally thought this was a great film the story was believable and has probobly the greatest cast ever for this type of movie including academy award winners nicolas cage robert duvall and the very hot anjolina jolie other than the lame stunt at the end this is a perfect blend of action comedy and drama my score is of
sweet romantic about stewart and sullavan writing love letters to each other without either one knowing who the other is naturally they work together and can't stand each other you can guess the rest beautifully acted by the entire cast sullavan stewart and frank morgan has a witty intelligent script and looks absolutely stunning it takes place in budapest and was shot in hollywood but i found myself believing i was seeing budapest everything looks so perfect and dream-like a one of a kind film don't miss it
this movie is cold bare truth often we think oh no that won't happen to me but it can drug smuggling is big money and often people are unknowingly tricked into doing things for smugglers the story of these two girls is the story of many young people who like them only wanted a exotic holiday which turned into a nightmare people need to know that these sort of events aren't improbable or exaggerated this is a major problem in would recommend this movie to mature viewers because of the understanding needed to truly appreciate this movie it is very emotional and raw well worth watching and certainly stays in your memory
rated had the original spiderman game for the pc for a couple of years still have not beaten it because on windows xp there is a glitch on one level which i cant beat because of be warned if you have for those who don't have xp give this game a a fun clean family game with action and its great for any spiderman the game you play spiderman and you take on various criminals who commit is a fun little game and i recommend it to any spiderman fan or a parent wanting a game for their
this is a plain old spooky ghost story i showed it to some friends of mine in my movie club and they were kept spellbound until the ending no blood or just good old fashioned suspense it starts out right from the beginning and builds and builds the ending is a real twist that caught me unawares directed and well acted it is also a period set in the which added to the atmosphere was so impressed i got the book by susan hill from amazon the movie follows the book rather closely a shame not readily available on dvd my copy is vhs this along with haunted are probably two of the best ghost stories i've ever scene which just goes to show that a little creativity outdoes in your face gore any day
a fine martino outing this is a spirited and enjoyable giallo with fine performances from good looking cast and principally the two leads george hilton and anita me the jig-saw puzzle of a plot is so convoluted and confusing you just sit back and enjoy rather than try to anticipate just when all seems resolved we are again taken on a further series of twists enjoyable twists it has to be with plenty of gory kills this a well paced movie with london athens and greek coastal locations a super finale set upon aegean rocks wraps things up and much fun was had by all
i was quite a fan of the series as a child and after that it has always remained in my mind as one of those memorable cartoons that made a difference in the early compared to previous animated series barbapapa il etait une fois l'homme most of which i love i find that other similar japanese cartoons of this kind released later can't match mazinger z as they started to boringly repeat the same very thing the novelty may be one of the best features of mazinger z another good point is its inventiveness with so many extravagant monsters strange devices and bizarre characters actually we were eager to see each new installment to find out what kind of new fiend or evil machine was awaiting us
someones at the door ohhh how i miss this show so bad but we are lucky to now have invasion thank you shawn cassidy american gothic had it i had to pick one thing that i liked best about the show it has to be its not predictable plot-lines favorite actor was lucas black i adore that southern accent i bought the dvd asap and my kids are fans too there is some hot n steamy scenes some devilish ones too so if kiddos will be watching you may want to it has humour on a joss wheedon level which so many shows lack adult wit and adult situation that are handled with finese the dvd has some extras but i wish it has many more if you want to get thrilled and enjoy a great show come watch american gothic
i bought this game on an impulse buy from walmart i am glad i did it was very entertaining listening to sean connery and playing the game i thought the graphics were the best i have ever seen in a remake the bonus levels were very hard the sniper one i think was too hard it made me so frustrated i didn't play the game for a week and a half there were too many people shooting at you with nothing to hide behind or life to handle it only thing i might change was the upgrade system i didn't notice any difference from un-upgraded equipment to the upgraded such as buying an armor upgrade didn't seem to make the armor stronger or more filling on my life meter i really liked the q copter i think the developers did a good job
i say the domino principle is an enormously underappreciated who has taken the time to investigate our contemporary history of rfk and in fact numerous others can only draw the conclusion that the author of the domino principle really knew what he was talking tucker could be lee harvey oswald or james earl ray or sirhan sirhan or arthur bremer maybe even john hinkley or timothy mention a conspiracy scenario involving spies big business and political assassinations is not really a fiction but an ominous part of our convoluted existential help the domino principle is more fact than this causes a little loss of sleep maybe it take my word for for yourselves
bolkan of don't torture a duckling locked away in a convent of carnal desires by her of all of the sadism she sees around of a young woman in a decides to run from the convent with her jewish friend from the two don't get very far before they are captured and then brought back to be tortured and forced to punishment she joins up with a band of muslims called the had invaded the convent prior and leads a crusade that turns into nothing short of a bloody battle behind the convent the heretic is a well-directed and fairly notorious piece of italian film is slightly gruesome and sleazy at acting is great and the characters are the heretic is a genuinely moving and intelligent movie with plenty of nudity and can't go wrong with out of
personally i absolutely love this movie and read the book first and decided to see the movie first of all the plot is truly original and one of a kind the acting is also great and i love the cast judd crandall fred gwynne fits his role perfectly and really sells it to you there are also a few corny lines thrown in there if they were meant to be corny but they really will lighten up the mood and provide a good laugh the maine atmosphere is really a perfect spot to film this movie and it kind of draws you in throughout the movie not only will you love it but you'll want to see it again and again i recommend this to any horror fan
my goodness this movie really really shows the talents of actors billy connelly flexes his acting muscle truly an amazing man if you look at him in absolution as a rebel boondock saints as a and then finally in fido as a zombie his character in fido looks from cute to frightening absolutely fabulous cariie ann moss is no hack either jumping in career from matrix and momento as a darker character to a heart warming conservative housewife rare these days to see actors being able to not be so onto the storyline spoilers don't worry this movie would make max brooks of zombie survival guide world war z happy with joy finally a well done twist of zombies and you like zombies if you don't like zombies if you are just bored or if you are too busy go see this movie
fido is a story about more well mannered zombies who have been trained to serve the human race all falls apart though when young zombie fido eats the family neighbor from then on disaster maybe not disaster but to some extent chaos occurs most of the people treat their zombies with fairness and one such character sleeps with his zombie funny part of the movie if not also very disturbing too and we find the loving fido whatever he may do this is a very funny and unique film especially for the zombie genre it is also probably one of the least violent of zombie movies negativity in this statement i very much recommend it to people who are looking for something funny and different i rate this rated r for zombie related violence
i just found the imdb and searched this film and i was moved almost to tears by the comments of all the people who saw this film as i did when or so years old in i saw it before the jungle book so i was eagle boy for a few hours and then mowgli for the next year i burst into tears at the cinema when the boy turned into the eagle and always wanted to see the film again when we got home we had a roast chicken dinner and i got the wish bone and guess who i wished to be my dad then said i bet you wished to be an eagle and of course we all know that wishes are broken if someone guesses so more tears and a little resentment to this day for not being able to fly away
i grew up during the time that the music in this movie was popular what a wonderful time for music and dancing my only complaint was that i was a little too young to go to the uso and nightclubs guess it sounds like i'm living in the past do have wonderful wrong with that world war was a terrible time except where music was concerned glenn death was a terrible sadness to us this movie will be a favorite of mine clio laine was excellent what a voice i don't know how i ever missed this movie my main reason for this commentary is to alert the modern generation to an alternative to rap and new age music which is offensive to me please watch this movie and give it a chance
brilliant my wife and i joined the sprawling line to see holly at the edinburgh film festival after seeing the film i can understand why there was such a long line holly is a touching story about an impossible connection between two people she is a young girl he is a worn out westerner the film grasped every bone in our body there aren't any graphic scenes or anything that is hard to watch its the surrealism of normality that really kicks you in the gut the film is beautifully shot among others we loved the scene where patrick teaches holly to ride a small motorcycle thuy rawness believe this is her first acting ron performance stayed with me for a couple of days highly recommended
it was very heart-warming as an expatriated french i particularly enjoyed this tv movie which i think deserves a broader distribution the acting was good and the bonds between each member of this rural french family seemed and so natural no doubt a great movie about the concept of family and inclusion in the face of homosexuality and aids one of the strongest aspect of the movie is this privileged relationship between the eldest son who has contracted hiv and the youngest son to whom the rest of the family try to hide the situation the two explore each other as time runs out for leo who is not willing to spend the rest of his life surviving under drugs
i enjoyed this movie haven't seen andy griffith in ages and felt he fit this role perfectly i've associated him with comedy but am pleased to see that wasn't troubled that anxiety disorder may not have been verbatim from a psychiatric textbook there are zillions of whatever-phobias and neuroses and these can take on a broad variety of quantitative and qualitative forms she is clearly a sensitive with extra-sensory powers as was understood by the local indians but not by any anglos it is not surprising that this character is vulnerable and nominally this is taken to be a light family movie it is actually more sophisticated than it seems also twist at the end came as a pleasant surprise to me and tied all the preceding action together in a bundle fun to contemplate the possibility of such spiritual guidance
at first you think another disney movie it might be good but a kids movie but when you watch it you can't help but enjoy it all ages will love this movie i first saw this movie when i was and now years later i still love it danny glover is superb and could not play the part any better christopher lloyd is hilarious and is perfect for the part tony danza is so believable as mel clark you can't help but to enjoy this movie i give it a
this movie is incredible if you have the chance watch it although a warning you'll cry your eyes out i do every time i see it and i own it and have watched it many times the performances are outstanding it deals with darkness and pain and loss but there is hope this movie made me look at the world differently vicarious experience according to my english teacher also if you've seen it note the interesting use of shadows and light home room is a phenomenal movie and i rate it for real because of the excellent acting amazing plot and heart-wrenching dialogue very tense very moving doesn't give all the answers but makes many good points about humankind
this movie is a must-see movie for all congress should see this truthful documentary from the point-of-view of the soldier as should everyone in america the previous reviewer totally missed the point is to reveal the truth about teaching our soldiers to kill people who are not terrorists but who just live in our territory and what it does to the soldiers we must support our troops by bringing them home immediately before another person is killed or injured this also reveals that the government does not help its veterans those who are injured mentally with post-traumatic stress disorder or physically with lost limbs julie a roberts streamwood il
every time i watch this movie i am more impressed by the whole production i have come to the conclusion that it is the best romantic comedy ever made everyone involved is perfect script acting direction sets and editing whilst james stewart can always be relied upon for a good performance and the supporting cast are magnificent it is margaret sullavan who reveals what an underrated actress she was her tragic personal life give poignancy to her qualities as a performer where comedy acting skills are not easy to achieve lubitsch managed to get the best and he obviously gave his best watch for the number of scenes which were done on one take breathtaking
i was dragged to this movie about four years ago by a french actress friend of the first half hour i was sitting in my uncomfortable seat at the new beverly theater in hollywood hating this film hating myself and even hating the french actress and don't know what happened but i was pulled into the film in a way that i hadn't been in years and this was despite the fact that one of the projectors broke and they had to do each changeover by hand i was in the theater for close to four hours but it was worth it believe that great movies pull you inside a world make you a part of it and then drop you off to talk about with your friends over coffee or a drink this film did that it was one of the best filmgoing experiences i have ever
i haven't seen this movie in about years but it still haunts me asked about my favorite films this is the one that i seem to always mention first there are certain films of art like this film dark city and breaking the waves that seem to touch a place within you a place so protected and hidden and yet so sensitive that they make a lifelong impression on the viewer not unlike a life-changing event such as the ending of a serious relationship or the death of a friend this film shook me when i first saw it it left me with an emotional hangover that lasted for several days
after reading only two of the comments herein as a lifelong bronte fan beginning with heathcliff and enduring with the many versions of rochester it is more than eye-opening to see that it is the unsung bronte sister who gave the lie to the male-chauvinist period the trio inhabited of course the miracle in all three versions of british domesticity is that the girls were all spinsters and their only realistic brushes with men were their vicar father and their wastrel brother that said finally it is anne bronte who has in her single assay proved the feminist point way way ahead of contemporary types and including the voting franchise ranks however history evinces more than a few who preceded including the greek heterai and sappho and the likes of an ancient yang kuei-fei and how about eve and her apple
i came across this film by accident when listing all the films i wanted my sister to record for me whilst i was on holiday and i am so glad that i included this one it deals with issues that most directors shy away from my only problem with this film is that it was made for tv so i couldn't buy a copy for my a touching story about how people with eating disorders don't necessarily shy away from everyone and how many actually have dieting buddies it brought to my attention that although bulimics can maintain a fairly stable weight it has more serious consequences on their health that many people are ignorant of
cameron grant is one of the best directors doing adult films his only rival is andrew blake celeste is dynamite all thru the movie but the office sequence with her two other ladies is just incredible nearly as good is asia performance with the construction worker i highly recommend this movie gave it a almost as good as cameron elements of desire which i gave a
sorry to say i have no idea what hollywood is doing sure give us movies like batman begins oh by the way hollywood i think they may cover the story line in the movie batman but please don't entertain us what we would really want to see batman and superman together i really hated this trailer because it left me wanting for more i was looking around to see when it was coming out it was like a terrible practical joke the graphics where good the story line seemed solid and it had all the trappings of a great movie unfortunately not going to happen for now to the producers directors and all the actors great job but i hate you for doing this to me you left me wanting more
the most amazing combination of love and psyche of two young in the most sublime manner and definitely touches your rare combination where the sequel surpasses the prequel in both storytelling and intensity of movie re affirms your faith in love and pain of separation the joy of seeing your most beloved is unparalleled and anything can be sacrificed ethan and julie have essayed eternal characters with such simplicity that gives the movie a sheer joy and love to watch a must see movie for all the people who believe in true love by far the most least one of them movie of all times
i really enjoyed this film all aspects of the film were top notch including the most important for me anyway the screenplay and the acting this is definitely one of richard strongest roles he is totally convincing in his performance just out of curiosity imagine how humphrey bogart or robert mitchum might have tackled this role this is my first exposure to jean work that i can remember she impressed so much here that i will definitely be on the lookout for her other work thelma ritter in an unglamourous role deserved the oscar nomination she received for playing the informant this film works on every level the black and white photography is perfectly appropriate and the story hooks the viewer right from the beginning widmark and peters have great chemistry in their difficult romance strongly recommended
i watched this tape immediately rewound it watched it again and laughed twice as hard i strongly recommend this tape for those who are not hateful of but uncomfortable around transvestites it shows you that transvestitism is a feature rather than the entirety of being the comedy is not single issue this man is brilliant all comics should aspire to his level of candor intelligence and talent
i as a teenager really enjoyed this movie mary kate and ashley worked great together and everyone seemed so at ease i thought the movie plot was very good and hope everyone else enjoys it to be sure and rent it also they had some great soccer scenes for all those soccer players
paris je t aime is a movie that explores the different kinds and aspects of love and all the emotions that it provokes this movie reunites some of the best directors from around the world such as gus van sant joel and ethan coen walter salles alfonso cuaron to tell short stories about love located in paris each one with their particular way of directing in this film we also have one of the best cast ever seen in a movie including such great actors like willem dafoe steve buscemi natalie portman elijah wood gerard depardieu and many more each one with great performances in conclusion this movie is a compilation of stories of happiness separation unexpected encounters and love
meek tiny almost insignificant polanski finds the invisibility of his characters and makes something enormous out of it in front and behind the camera he creates one of the most uncomfortable masterpieces i had the pleasure to see and see and see again it never me down people even people who know me pretty well there something wrong with me based on my attraction or i should say devotion for le locataire they may be right i don't know but there is something irresistibly enthralling within darkness and i haven't even mentioned the humor the mystery surrounding the apartment and the previous tenant the mystery that takes over him and naturally us me that building populated by great old academy award winners melvyn douglas shelley winters jo van fleet lila kedrova for anyone who loves movies this is compulsory viewing one two three many many viewings
the tenant is roman greatest film imo and i love chinatown but this one is so much more original and unconventional and downright creepy also a great black comedy some people i have shown this film to have been by it afterwards so be forewarned it does affect some people that way polanski does a great job acting the lead role in the tenant as well as directing it
a very gritty gutsy portrayal of a part of world war history that most of us in the no idea ever occurred i would love to have this on video it only was shown on one time as far as i know back in i have asked around for this movie and most video stores don't even know about it great actresses all around wish that i could see it again top notch series
i just can't agree with the above comment lots of interesting and indeed amazing filmic imagery in this one it has an unusual structure and moves well toward a frightening climactic sequence that is notable for effective use of silence more it explores the odd impulse of suicide in a very frank way not pulling any punches in what it shows yet not dwelling and over-sensationalising the subject matter it has hints of documentary about it as well as horror and art-house cinema and deserves a place amongst the canon of different horror films like the blair witch project and the original ring of which it predates and could well be an unacknowledged influence on definitely worth seeing if you're interested in the edges of horror cinema
this is one to watch a few times the excellent writing shows they had to have lived this story or know someone whom did because they nailed it freebird made me relive and laugh at my misspent youth the title was a great choice great film setting story soundtrack and characters a biker flick but would be a shame to pigeon hole it that way funny to the bone kinda like trailer park boys in the if you've never seen tpb make a point to if you like this film you will thank me i hope to see more of these characters in other films sequel could be done a whole lot more of the world i would like to see through their eyes
the third and final installment of hanzo the razor is the most concrete of them all the training even gets completed within the first five minutes of the film not for everyone this film details investigation of loan sharking being performed by an order of blind monks it also makes a historical comment on the prideful refusal of old japan to incorporate western technology where the first hanzo film was just a funny and gory ride with little connection to plot hanzo got the gold manages to connect everything and brings it all home in the end definitely the perfect finale oh yeah hanzo still has a lot of sex and a lot of needless blood and violence hanzo the razor after all
sabrina the teenage witch was one of my favorite shows of life d i used to watch back to back episodes everyday when i got home from school so far i think i've watched every episode at least once and the whole series or times melissa joan hart plays the perfect teenage with normal teenager troubles that we can all relate to funny smart outgoing witty and a lot more caroline rhea and beth broderick both fit the part very well as aunts zelda the intelligent scientist and hilda the crazy wacky one make a perfect balance in life though i must agree that the college years aren't as good as her high school years but that doesn't mean they weren't still good i think the ending was awesome although it was not what i hoped it made sense and i loved it anyways
what a thrill ride twisted and thought provoking once again sharon stone pulls off her drop dead gorgeous spellbinding character of author catherine tramell impeccably the original basic instinct takes place in san francisco the sequel takes place in london where catherine has now relocated both bustling cities known for excitement haute couture and a perfect place for someone like catherine trammel to take residency david morrisey plays the smooth role of psychiatrist dr michael glass the character david thewlis plays as roy washburn with scotland yard is a refreshing departure from his role as lupin in the harry potter series flashy cars designer clothes sex drama all of the basic instincts mind bending throughout great screenplay from the climactic opening scene to the surprise ending this film is anything but boring everyone in the theater was glued to the screen
hello again i have to comment on this wonderful exciting and believable tale of romance and intrigue the music in wonderful and memorable very good colorful movie another movie i liked as well later on was high society with bing crosby wonderful music thanks for listening florence forrester-stockton reno nevada

this is a good movie something fun about watching money be blown at a super rate especially from a point of view take it for what it is a fun little movie about a dream coming true and what a kid might do with million dollars don't like it don't watch it they make movies for the watchers not the people that have nothing better to do then complain in their lives
red rock west is one of those rare films that keeps you guessing the entire time as to what will happen next nicolas cage is mistaken for a contract killer as he enters a small town trying to find work dennis hopper is the bad guy and no one plays them better look for a brief appearance by country singing star dwight yoakam this is a serious drama most of the time but there are some lighter moments what matters is that you will enjoy this low budget but high quality effort
i caught this movie on my local movie channel and i rather enjoyed watching the film it has all the elements of a good teen film and more this film aside from dealing with boys-girls relationships and sex and the like also deals with the issue of steroid use by young film has that real-life feel to it no loud music no special effects and no outrageous scenes which for this movie was right that feel makes it easy to relate to the characters in the film some of which we probably know from where we a good movie fun to
this movie is simply incredible i had expected something quite different form the film that i actually saw however it is very insightful in that it shows the aggressive nature of human sexuality and its linkage with animal behavior let me warn those among the readers of this article who are easily offended by content that is all too sexual for the explicit sexual nature of this film feels like a high-brow sort of pornography it even features a scene that comes extremely close to i strongly suggest seeing this rare work of sexual art every minute of the picture breathes the sexual spirit of the seventies by the way one should not forget how times have see it worth your money and time
enjoyable in spite of leslie performance mr howard plays philip as a flat uninteresting character one is supposed to feel sorry for this man however i find myself cheering bette davis mildred ms davis gives one her finest performances received an academy award nomination thanks to her performance she brings this rather dull movie to life sure not to miss when mildred tells philip exactly how she feels about him
i saw this movie with my family and it was great this film is more than just a documentary offers not more than cold facts with long and lots of complete power of this movie comes from the impressive pictures being filmed under water in the air or the watching this movie you can learn more about our planet than with just reading a book it shows that we are embedded in the circular flow of life this movie is not only for environmental fanatics although people that want to look a good movie with a message should watch it this movie taught me that we are not only living on the live with and through the earth and all plants and animals grow and die with us
bill and bogus journey is the sequel to bill and excellent adventure their bogus journey follower almost directly after the first movie and does just as good of a job if not better to entertain the plot is an evil person from the future is trying to kill bill and ted using evil robots that look exactly like bill and ted once the robots kill bill and ted they must compete with the grim reaper and return their lives to acting in the movie is top notch and even thought it is a little weird at times especially bill and conversations it is a great movie the wannabe rockers sure have made another great movie pick this up the next time your at blockbuster
i caught this film at a test screening was very surprised to find a really sweet and fun story well acted natasha henstridge is the next julia roberts the male lead was awsome very funny film takes place in the best locations in new york made me want to go there i just saw you've got mail i thought it had to be you was a much better story was clean and great for whole family i think it will do well audience i saw it with loved it a definite recommend
this is simply the epitome of what a made for tv movie should be it was a lazy sunday afternoon when my wife and i were in grad school that we stumbled upon this the cheesy acting the poorly written script the good ol boys the ridiculous yet somehow obvious cliché and banal premise the riding in pickup trucks with your propped-up wife-corpse it has it will meet familiar characters gold-digging hussy stupid rich boy who wants to make it on his own friends-who-know-better daddy who knows better but drives son away and the wife-corpse propped up in a pick-up and the title several things in our lives have been texas tragedies since watching this beauty everyone involved in its creation deserves a medal
on mtv cribs all the ballers and shot callers pull the classic movie scarface out of their dvd collection this may give you an idea that scarface is a gangster movie sure there are gangsters and mobs in it but not the point of scarface tony montana pacino is just a cuban refuge looking for a new way of life he falls in with the mob group and becomes a well-known drug lord montana was all for doing what you wanted to do with your life the classic phrase say hello to my little friend is in scarface this quote is what always comes to mind when i think about brian depalmas movie scarface this falls under my top favorite movies i would rate it of definitely a movie you must see phenomenal
i had to see this gem twice to really appreciate all of it when a widowed father of two interrupts his two sons sleep with a shocking revelation they are torn between believing him and not as the horrifying events of this tale unfold we learn a lot about the father about his two sons and about their destinies with shocking twist after shocking twist this film never allows for a lull in the plot bill paxton plays the father but the most notable performances are that of his older son fenton played by matthew o'leary and his younger son adam played by jeremy sumpter this is one of the best thrillers that i have seen in a while and you will want to watch this a few times to appreciate every intricate aspect of the plot i give this film a
this film gave me nightmares for months and i'm this is the scariest movie ever made that is no exaggeration i saw this movie at school in english lessons and no one else was scared which amazed me after reading other reviews i'm glad i'm not the only person who found this so scary
a chance encounter between a salesman and a hit-man changes both their lives this is an odd film that works an impressive effort for writer-director shepard in a daringly unglamorous role that is a far cry from james bond brosnan is surprisingly effective as the lonely hit-man who starts to buckle under the stress of his job but is unable to connect emotionally with anyone to help him cope kinnear is equally good as the salesman a decent fellow with a void in his life davis is fine as flirtatious wife mainly a character study the film is rewarding because it feels fresh and unpredictable an extremely dark comedy
there is nothing not to like about moonstruck i'm from a new york italian family and i actually get a little homesick when i watch it the actors actresses the plot the subplots the humor they were all fantastic it starts a little slow but a lot happens in that two days i fell in love with laboheme because of this movie on my list of favorite movies moonstruck is number a feel good movie where you leave the theatre humming amore or repeating some of your favorite lines old man if you give those dogs another piece of my food i'll kick you till you're dead chrissy bring me the big knife dead do you love him loretta good because when you do they drive you crazy because they know they can i always put moonstruck on when nothing good to watch because it makes me happy
i caught this movie on last night and you know danny masterson was a pretty good actor in the film and its great to see him in something other than that show the film isnt rated but in my opinion i would rate it just because of the nudity and plenty of adult content but all in all i loved it i thought that wisecracks were pretty funny its just basically about a guy who has no job girlfriend or money and eventually gets a job as a private investigator of a messenger gets framed for the murder of a rock star and the rock stars girlfriend is one of the people that really need to help him out i give stars
this is the only full length feature film about the world of bridge i found the first minutes a bit slow but after that the movie is absolutely perfect in describing professional bridge players and how they go about earning a living of the scenes are very funny i don't think that a non-bridge player would get the charm of this movie of the dresses are really beautiful pity the movie is in black and white i can only imagine what they would look like in colour the way the media are portrayed is absolutely hilarious there is no way on earth bridge will ever be like that it as soon as you can and tell your friends about it
this is one of the best bond games i have ever played because missions are very very fun to play they have lots of action in them they can be really hard sometimes that makes it even more fun the weapons that you use are really good the cars in this game are really good the driving missions are fun to do this james bond game has a good story to it the voice over actors in this game are really good and it is cool that pierce brosnan is in this game and the way the characters look is really good because they look like what they look like in real life which is really cool also the graphics in this game pretty score out of
kubrick again puts on display his stunning ability to craft a perfect ambiance for a film mainly through cinematography but also using an ingenious score he creates a chilling and ominous tone that resides over the entire film and thoroughly gets my spine tingling from the start it really is this flawless ambiance that makes the shining the masterpiece that it is in my eyes of course it doesn't hurt that jack nicholson gives one of the greatest performances i've ever seen a frighteningly authentic portrayal of a mind gone mad duvall and lloyd are artificial to be nice but easy to look past those two when the rest of the film is so brilliant plus it features the actor with the greatest name of all time crothers
i love this movie beautifully funny and utterly believable characters each scene richer and more wonderful than the last every aspect of this movie is filled with wit and humour and love and depth a complex and engrossing story too this movie is filled with love humour and intelligence totally great
as far as the muppet line goes however this is not the best nor the second best this was marketed towards the kiddies but has some dark and emotionally upsetting adult moments to which parents may not wish to expose their children one of which showcases miss piggy going postal in a jealous rage which lasts basically throughout the duration of this that however the story is progressive and highly entertaining one scene in which joan rivers and miss piggy go berserk in a department store is simply hilarious and there are other parts of this work which contain the same level of levity and like this very much and enjoy it still rates a fiend
i love this movie purple rain came out the year i was born and it has had my heart since i can remember prince is so tight in this movie i went to a special showing of purple rain last night and it was like a concert i was glad to see some true fans cause this movie is so undervalued it is really one of the greatest movies of all time the music is untouchable the movie is about the kid played by prince his family is dysfunctional his band is the hottest act in town and he has his eyes on the apollonia an aspiring singer there is no question why purple is my favorite color i can thank the kid for that so if you have not seen this then you are need to asap this is a classic
in a not so conventional sense of the movie was one of my favorites as a young child and i just recently remembered it and thought to look it up while many of the details are no longer clear in my mind the overall feeling that the movie gave me has stuck with me over the parents feel that their children can handle mature and sometimes violent themes then i highly recommend this movie it taught me a lot about life and death and brought forth in me a lot of emotion to this day it remains one of my favorite films
refreshing gem featuring effective dialog combined with excellent acting to establish the characters and involve you enough to care what happens to them the douglas and widmark characters are realistic heroes palance is his usual evil presence widmark win the fisticuffs fight scene a car chase of less than seconds with a end and a lengthy chase on foot that shames the overdone chase sequences of contemporary hollywood you know how it will likely end but the suspense and interest are sustained throughout the end of the chase is one of the most realistic you will ever see the film seems to slow a little past the middle but stay with it for the rewarding conclusion
i'm an admirer of hal films especially henry fool fay grim is a sequel to that film and has a similar style and sense of humor the plot however is completely different fay grim brilliantly by the iconic parker posey tries to track down her missing notebooks and finds herself amid conspiracies and espionage the supporting cast of the folks from the first film as well as jeff goldblum saffron burrows and a much-welcomed return from indie-darling elina lowensohn is excellent and the film has lots of surprises the director claims this is part of a star trilogy serving as the empire strikes back of the series if this is true i can't wait to see the third installment i just hope i don't have to wait more years for it
the story for the first-aired television installment of columbo is simple one-half of successful mystery-writing team does away with the other frames an unseen mafia group is blackmailed by an admirer does away with the admirer and is tricked up by the stalwart that said this is still one of the most entertaining in the history benefiting tremendously by the work of the late jack cassidy and star peter the notability of being directed by a young steven spielberg the episode also has a air of the macabre because of the future of two of its stars cassidy and barbara colby the two share several scenes together and it is poignant that both would die tragically within a decade of this filming cassidy in an apartment fire and colby at the hands of assailants yet to be found after over three both demises are true-life mysteries
this movie was a classic i would have to say that this movie caught the best of a working man who learns from his mistakes if we could all get along and learn the way everyone in this movie did it had an important part of showing how family is an important part of life and how pride can cause you to lose something important in life if we can not find a big throat and swallow are pride
not everything is said in this excellent first feature from céline sciamma the friendship the wanting to fit in the first sexual feelings all this and much more is sublimated through the underwater synchro swimming three girls in the movie try to find and express their personality in a very different way it is a much less violent approach to the understanding of the teenage years compared to say thirteen but a very worthwhile trip must see and please leave all american cinematographic preconceptions at he door the soundtrack is by the cinéma
the fluttering of butterfly wings in the atlantic can unleash a hurricane in the pacific according to this theory related to the chaos theory i'm not sure exactly how every action no matter how small or insignificant will start a chain reaction that can lead to big events this small jewel of a film shows us a series of seemingly-unrelated characters most of them in paris whose actions will affect each others lives six-degrees-of-separation theory can be applied as well each story is a facet of the jewel that is this film the acting is finely-tuned and nuanced tautou is luminous the stories mesh plausibly the humor is just right and the viewer leaves the theatre nodding in agreement
notable because of notorious explicit scene when the gorgeous maruschka detmers takes her young penis from his trousers and into her mouth even without this moment the film is a splendid if slightly disturbing passionate and blindingly sexy ride detmers puts in a great performance as the partly deranged insatiable delight wandering about her flat nude dressed partly dressed and naked she steals most of the film about love sexual passion philosophy and politics for me the last two get a little lost and the ending is most confusing when her fiancé is released whilst fellow terrorists are released she seems uncertain as to who she wants and the young lover seems more interested in his exams than anything else as she weeps beautifully of course
if people didn't know who barbra streisand was before that sure knew who she was show went on to win emmys stands out as one the best things streisand has ever made up of singing standards from room to room filled with musicians including a segment where she is a little girl ending with a splendid version of her signature the musical tour of barbra sings poverty better than it best part just some great days are here a funny girl in all a great part of television by one of the greatest performers in the world
dick tracy is easily the best comic book based movie made to date the movie has the same feel as the comic book staying true to the color scheme the batman series has climbed fallen climbed and fallen again dick tracy has true staying power as something that both adults and children can enjoy the good guys triumph over evil without blood and gore to get the point across al pacino does a wonderful job of his own adaptation of big boy caprice and madonna is memorable as breathless but the best job by far is warren beatty who just epitomizes dick tracy just as he did with clyde barrows i can't wait until it comes out on dvd on april my tape is wearing thin
i'm a rather pedestrian person with somewhat lowbrow tastes however i occasionally try to raise the bar on my cultural awareness this movie was one of my attempts i was in awe throughout the entire movie i liked it so much that i got my own tape so i could see it again this is a very thoughtful and emotionally striking movie i saw it as a huge question to the viewer what is the depth of sacrifice to duty one can accept can be asked to accept should accept as a military member this is of course an important question to me this question weighs heavily on the viewer of this
tom turns in yet another oscar-worthy performance as dominick luciano the brain-damaged garbage man helping put his brother liotta as eugene through medical is a must-see for all movie lovers and all lovers of life and the small studder to the eratic dancing to the repeated words oh jeez whenever nicky is in a bind the belieavablitly of performance is so excellent that you will have to concentrate to remember that an actor on screen
when i was a kid of i always watched movies and television that i wasn't supposed to and this was one of them one of my favorite movies of all time and it has to be the funniest movie i have ever seen in my life the acting is excellent they don't make comedies like this anymore these days that are actually funny and make you laugh without resorting to excrement or some type of vomit-inducing body fluid as in those retarded judd apatow movies starring unfunny non-actors like seth rogen movie is a classic with actors who can actually act and deserve all the accolades
the film is side spliting from the outset eddie just seems to bring that uniqueness to the stage and makes the most basic thing funny from having an ice cream as a child to the long old tradition of the family get together the film is very rare in this country but unsure of availability in other countries i have searched through a lot of web sites and still no luck phoned companies that search for rare videos and there are year waiting lists for it so hints are very welcome if any one likes eddie murphy as a comedian and the video get is worth the money and can't go far wrong
i think that this movie is very fun and horror i love elvira and i like this movie very pity that second part of this wonderful movie had no success because it very funny like a first part i also regret that besides of this movie i have no seen cassandra peterson in other think that she is amazing actress with i hope that ii'll see her in future in the third part of adventures cassandra peterson is one of my favorite comedy actresses cassandra if you read this know that you are the best and my heart will be with you you can rely on me what can i more add this is cool and classical movie
saw this my last day at the festival and was glad i stuck around that extra couple of days poetic moving and most surprisingly funny in own strange way so rare to see directors working in this style who are able to find true strangeness and humor in a hyper-realistic world without seeming precious or upsetting the balance manages to seem both improvised yet completely controlled it i hesitate to make comparisons because these filmmakers have really digested their influences malick loach usual suspects and found their own unique style but if you like modern directors in this tradition ramsay david gordon greene you're in for a real treat this is a wonderful film and i hope more people get to see it if this film plays in a festival in your city go go go
here is one movie that is genuinely funny at every single moment that it covers how can it not be given that this movie stars the creators of south park and is directed by david zucker when i first saw this movie i did'nt immediately realise that coop and doug were really matt and trey but their talent in acting and writing came out as quite impressive i was pleasantly surprised to learn that they were really matt and trey later on the humor is sometimes crude sometimes foul sometimes brilliant sometimes subtle sometimes loud and sometimes stupid but overall this is one hell of a movie that is without doubt under rated well actually its insane totally insane
this game is the best spider-man to hit the fight old foes such as exclusive to the is the symbiote carnage on dock dock ock was supposedly reformed and using his inventions for was really planing a symbiote invasion see the rest for you can play in numerous old costumes seen throughout the every costume has special can collect comics in the game and then view them in a comic last but not a gold spider symbol to change into gives you another health they they can be rough at still music on every level and great voice out of game it today
we loved the movie i am a mother to two little men i love having a movie i can watch with them where men have integrity and character moveis where money is not the most important thing and are forever and love means more then words do wish we saw more of the davis family but over all i loved it left me with the same feeling the others did please don't be over we both wish actors would not new actors were good replacement year old son loved this movie too asked me to go buy them all he is a movie critic so for him to say this tells me something family should all see this move buy it for friends help bring back a time of values we will be reading the books now that we are hooked really hope to see more be blessed happy moving
this film enhanced my opinion of errol flynn while flynn is of course best known for his savoir-faire and sprezzatura throw in a couple of high-falutin european terms this film gives him an opportunity to stretch only slightly as an actor as he plays an unabashed social climber with a big ego and a sense of nerve to match the supporting cast is excellent everyone seems well-chosen for their story moves briskly and while not particularly profound misses perhaps intentionally the opportunity to render social commentary on the massively uneven distribution of income during that time it certainly entertains and satisfies from what i know of jim corbett the story is also reasonably faithful to history i also really liked the great depictions of san francisco all in all little not to like about this well worth the time to watch it
a fine effort for an australian show which is probably not surprising seeing as there seems to be somewhat of a resurgence in quality aussie drama dare i compare this show to the brilliance of love my way no but it is reminiscent of early secret life of us the cast is great gibney works her magic in the first two episodes i have seen the british cast is strong also especially the callum and lizzie characters but abe forsythe may be the saving light that it needs saving if this show is to get another season i wasn't a fan of his performance in the awesomely awesome marking time mini series a few years back but he was great as hal in always greener its also good to see brooke satchwell again lets hope the show keeps improving with each episode
another channel great canned long before time compelling acting from phil davis and the rest of the cast sexy intelligent and funny i remember watching it at the time and even then asking around no-one had really heard of it but trying to find someone now who can recall it is even harder perhaps channel don't do their job well enough in drumming up the enthusiasm needed either that or the general public is too interested in the tv vomit that is big brother i suspect the latter downloading of garth dark place prompted channel to release a dvd of that series hope the same can happen with north square
ever since i heard of the ralph bakshi version of the lord of the rings i wondered what the hell is rotoscope animation well i finally found out i saw this movie about three years ago not having any idea who ralph bakshi is and i liked it a lot very good story line it even has a little character development which is great for a cartoon see it if you get bored with contemporary animation don't get me wrong i'm not saying just a nice cartoon a pretty good movie too
okay truthfully i saw the previews for this movie and thought to myself what are the producers thinking hutton jolie and duchovny how could the monotoned actor possibly compete with natural power on the screen but surprisingly the two had the kind of chemistry that showed intense caring without a kiss even humor matched up to spark and fire as for hutton he played the psycho very well contrasting with calm delivery of life threatening situations overall i was very impressed with the writing and character development i gave it stars
at two and a quarter hours this is a sometimes slow moving thoughtful film interrupted by vast sword battles the battle between darkness and light is signified by the constant motif of the blazing sun and is superbly demonstrated by a three way fight between demons bandits and soldiers in a forest during an prepared following a stunning sword fight under lightning filled skies the end of this picture will have you scratching your head in puzzlement
the premise may seem goofy but since character doesn't take it seriously it helps ease the audience into this mix of mysticism and modern-day hard-boiled child abduction excellent cast particularly charles dance and charlotte lewis and murphy is at the height of his peak in also some great a very surreal dream sequence and a fairly original plot often overlooked in the pantheon of murphy flicks but this one is worth a look
i thought this movie was very well put together the voice-overs were also great i liked how they all overcame their conflicts and reached their goals i would recommend this movie to anyone it was definitely worth the time and money to watch it atlantis has some comic scenes that made me laugh other scenes made me sad and others made me glad it is a movie any age can enjoy from the moment milo is the crazy profesor or until he gathers the crew up for the fantastic voyage under the sea after i watched the movie i read the book it was good as well but the movie puts better pictures in your mind it is just like the book but go ahead and watch this movie
great how this movie pulls you along i had honest laughs don't care that low budget cause the thing works for me to be honest my wife didn't really go for it in the same way but she prefers a different type of film she did admit though that it was very creative and well put together and probably all on a shoe string these characters lives are strange and troubled give me something to relate to in my own world just keep going and be who you are dreams are what you make of them in watching this movie a second and third time i realized that there are some hidden moments that passed by me on the first time through what can i say i like my fun with some complexity anyway liked it hope to see more
there is such rubbish on the cable movie channels that i hit a gem with this one from beginning to end it had me gripped and deserves top of two sons hears messages from god to kill people who he is told are the opening credits showed the director as one of the cast that can often be a warning of a bad film exceptionally it is the reverse here as the drama is non-stop from beginning to there is not one moment in the movie when one is not fully enthralled as there are no unnecessary or needless sub-plots and the script is first class the actors give wholly convincing performances especially the lead child actor who is exceptional film is at least as good as the likes of silence of the lambs
this movie was like any jimmy stewart and very performance as beautiful witch who longs to be subtle facial every move and gesture all create unique and somewhat haunting left us hanging on her every should not fail to mention ernie kovacs and elsa highly commendable performances as the scotch loving writer obsessed with the world of and the latter as the lovable aunt who can't seem to stop using magic even when forbidden romantic scenes between stewart and novak are beautifully done and the chemistry between them is then again when is the chemistry between jimmy stewart and any leading lady bad
okay first of all i got this movie as a christmas present so it was free first this movie was meant to be in stereoscopic it is for the most part but whenever the main character is in her car the movie falls flat to what not that hard to film in a car second the story isn't very good there are a lot of things wrong with why are they showing all of the deaths in the beginning of the film it made the movie suck whenever some was going to get killed watch it for a good laugh but don't waste your time buying it just download it or something for cheap
i recently had the pleasure of seeing the big bad swim at the ft lauderdale film festival and i must say it is the best film i have seen all year and the only film i have ever felt inspired to write a on this film was beautifully directed and combined a script with realistic dialogs excellent acting and an inspiring message ordinary lives come together in an adult swim class and become extraordinary in a celebration of the diversity of life this is poignantly illustrated by the imagery in the first minute of this captivating film where we see only the legs and torso of individuals in various shapes and sizes enter into a pool of water this film is brilliantly directed as the actors are placed and positioned in captivating scenes which hold your attention and imagination
another excellent arnold movie this futuristic movie has great action in it and is one of best movies arnold is framed as a bad guy in this movie and plays a game of death this movie is excellent and a great sci-fi action movie i've always liked this movie and it has to be one of the greatest adventure movies of all time out of perfection
this is a beautiful movie that is wonderfully acted by all players it will make you laugh and it will make you cry the very end of the movie gets me to mist up every time if you want to see a great movie this is it jimmy stewert supplies a wonderfully witty performance and frank morgan as mr matuschek is spellbinding diversity of character is nothing short of amazing william tracy as pepi is terrific comic relief and delivers some of the movies most important lines and performances felix bressart delivers a fantastic performance as perovitch a stumbling bumbling shop worker ambition is to please those he works with it is a simple story of how close co-workers can become and how two people who have great animosity towards each other fall in love though unusual circumstances
excellent plot within a plot within a plot shame about two of my film heroes having a good snog must be my well acted by all you never quite know going to out-do who the last little twist at the end allows for all to get their just to all a harmless tongue in cheek thriller which if it has any faults is probably michael over-use of the word bloody but his signature isn't
saw this in the theater in and fell out of my chair laughing more than once do you know about the best damn baseball player who ever know how going to end but it has a great time getting there the training scenes are very funny but the best scene may be the one when jack and reno are attempting to watch the falcons v vikings monday night football game while attempting a make-up dinner with their and russell seem to have a lot of fun with this one and too bad that overlooked as a top notch comedy
this movie has no story only about a bunch of guys who tortures an innocent young girl to is what they do they beat her put her in a net and let her hang inside like birdfood spin her around on a chair until she pukes expose her to loud noise pour boiling oil on her put worms in her sores crush her hand with a sledge-hammer and finally pokes a needle through her movie was so realistic that if i didn't know it was fake i would have thought it was a snuff-movie although i was disgusted by this movie i really liked it it scared me i guess it fills some kind of purpose i give it a
i first saw thief as a child which makes me almost as old as the jinn i guess as any kid would be i was delighted with the imagination inventiveness and energy of the film several years later i realized how much of the satire and wit of the script i had missed on that first viewing i have never passed up an opportunity to watch it throughout the intervening years in addition to the script the production transcends the fantasy genre this is korda the storyteller at his very best when you see thief as a child you know that had a great time when you see thief as an adult you know that seen a masterpiece as timeless as the story it treats an amazing mccarthy
a very close and sharp discription of the bubbling and dynamic emotional world of specialy one old guy that makes his first experiences in his gay love to an other boy during an vacation with a part of his liked this film because of his extremly clear and surrogated storytelling with all this sound-close-ups and quiet moments wich had been full of intensive
a movie about the cruelty of this world i found it liberating as only truth can be it also contains some quite funny bits some of the acting is extraordinary see maria hofstätter for instance the director has tried to depict life as realistically as possible succeeding coherently the sex scenes are explicit and no more fake than those of a hard-core movie although i hardly understood a sentence i found the vision of the movie in the original language with subtitles much more rewarding because with the dubbing half the great work of the actors gets lost the voice of the character played by maria hofstätter is particularly hard to duplicate by a favorite movie
though cher and cage are the focal points of this story gardenia and dukakis are good counterparts for this is where loretta and ronny will be in still in love the whole cast does a nice job from aiello to john it shows a real slice of life though i saw this long i am glad it finally catapulted cage to the place where he was recognized in hollywood for his talent from the music to the scenes at the opera to the kitchen table this is a very entertaining movie
julie waters is outstanding and adrian pasdar a revelation in a very warm very real and extraordinarily entertaining look at the complications gender dysphoria and transvestism cause in a young life at the heart of this movie is the very real truth that you must accept yourself before you can hope for others to accept you
sad story of a downed pilot brady is shot down over occupied territory the local ranchers extended him kindness and protection at the cost of their own lives i had never heard of this movie and it snagged me for two hours after the film is over i'm glad i took the time an entire story told to explain the look on face at the start of the film
soapdish may go down as one of the single most under-rated movies ever stellar unselfish cast who understood exactly where the movie was going and the roles they played in it while everyone hammed it up there was no one-upmanship kline showed wit and great physical comedy goldberg and downey knew how to carry on a funny conversation while someone else was talking i could just go not pass this movie by
this is one of three movies that i can think of that were sadly overlooked at the time and unfortunately still overlooked one of the others was clownhouse directed by victor salva a movie horribly overlook due to problems another would be closet which strikes me as somewhat great but not nearly as bad as the reviews i've seen paper house is well worth your time and i think that it is one of those very quiet films that will just stick in your brain for far longer than you might think i mean years after i've seen it and i still give it some pause whereas something that i might have seen months ago has gone into the ether
loulou delights in the same way an expensive high quality french wine does it leaves you with a very fine theme isn't new the film doesn't carry an original plot either its colored picturing shows fine but not extraordinary its setting is serious its elegant styling never and nowhere puts any weight on your one further may say about loulou beyond doubt that this very french film stands out for its excellent acting the three leads convincingly reflect all numerous doubts and tenses sparkling between them making the plot alive their acting fully invites you to participate to make those around at the time loulou also provides an extra bonus its perfectly captured mood of
this film is a true and historical film it is very useful to those researching the lds church because it is true it is an excellent film and i recommend is very factual exciting and motivational there are some who think it is not factual but it is about the restoration of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints and about the prophet joseph smith who restored it it has such events in his life as the disease that he had when he was a small boy his courting emma smith emma his wife giving birth and so on but most importantly it reveals the restoration of the church
beautiful film pure cassavetes style gena rowland gives a stunning performance of a declining actress dealing with success aging alcoholism she tries to escape her own subconscious ghosts embodied by the death spectre of a young girl acceptance of oneself of human condition though its overall difficulties is the real purpose of the film the parallel between the theatrical sequences and the film itself are puzzling like if the stage became a way out for the heroin if all american movies could only be that top-quality dealing with human relations on an adult level not trying to infantilize and standardize feelings one of the best dramas ever
this is one of my favorite movies of all time great and the acting is brilliant in the scene in which michael caine calls the police in tears and then stops the waterworks the second he finishes the call really displays brilliance the twists are a lot of fun the film is top-notch
generally it was a good movie with an ideal ending the acting was spectacular and the characters didn't stray from their persons i especially liked the plot although you knew what was going to happen it still gave the element of surprise through out the entire movie however i find that coming on to the ending it could have been a little longer to me it seemed like it was rushed a bit as if the writer was trying to take linens off the lines before the rain fell for what happened to brother hayden for all we know he died in the hospital maybe he was the one that setup the entire thing who knows maybe there will be a sequel maybe if there is i cant wait to see it
the which are shown in this film are with a lot of care and detail and depict what a lot of people from around the world think of the american policies not neccessarily the united states itself it shows what most of the people around the world think about america and what the americans dont know about themselves directors showing amazing minutes each of something which will give us viewers a lot to think about when they go home after watching the movie
hello everyone this is my first time posting and i just love the movie no child of mine and i could watch it over and over well i taped it a long time ago like a few years ago and i dropped it and broke it and i haven't seen it in a few years could any one please tell me when it will come on again i would really appreciate it can email me if you want to cause that is my favorite movie of all including empty cradle to and if anyone knows when that comes on to please let me would really appreciate it
francesca annis michael kitchen and robson green wow what a so this is no anna karenina but it is a good love story very well-written and well-acted by all even a few laugh-out-loud moments mixed in with some pretty serious observations on fidelity age bias and parental guitar music added to the story as i have been a fan of ms annis since lillie the and mr since the buccaneers and enchanted april i have only recently discovered mr green and mrs jones touching evil etc making me ask the question why had i not seen reckless until recently admittedly more of a chick flick than something a man will sit through it is perfect for a rainy lazy viewing
world at war is perhaps the greatest documentary series of all time the historical research is virtually flawless even after a quarter century it is the most accurate and definitive documentary about an invaluable historical work that includes interviews with some of the most important and fascinating figures from the war i highly recommend it as a learning experience
the idea ia a very short film with a lot of information interesting entertaining and leaves the viewer wanting more the producer has produced a short film of excellent quality that cannot be compared to any other short film that i have seen i have rated this film at the highest possible rating i also recommend that it is shown to office managers and business people in any establishment what comes out of it is the fact that people with ideas are never listened to their voice is never heard it is a lesson to be learned by any office that wants to go forward i hope that the produced will produce a second part to this idea i look forward to viewing the sequence once again congrats to halaqah media in producing a film of excellence and quality with a lesson in mind
spectacular horror movie that will give you the chills once you get settled with it the atmosphere is very creepy and stylish the score is chilling but the best about the movie is performances rare to get scared by performances and this solid acting plays an important part in the scare story is very interesting and gets your attention since the first minutes though the woman in black does not have much screen time she makes the necessary appearances to chill the audience in some brilliant scenes the dialogs are very descriptive and make your imagination work and when it becomes really scary you have the chance watch this on theater a totally different experience but as scary as this is one of the best ghost movies ever and directed for people that want to get scared
this motion picture has a steady haunting pace backed up with great acting of best performances and a story that is revealed to us over that the music fully establishes the mood and assists in maintaining an uneasy cautious and somber story is enhanced by using aboriginals their stories and their tensions with the dominant white population to deliver a fantasy tale that is they are unrelated in story as well as genre this maintained the same feeling within me as ursula le lathe of heaven last wave is a dramatic thriller with some shocking moments remember hacking and slicing doesn't make a film a horror movie the psychological element of fear and trepidation that rests within us all
i know not what you expect from a film with this sort a direct descendant of the best years of our the men films dealing with men who are in the with tragic circumstances but this film is full of and performances it features stellar performances stoltz and helen hunt a rather risque nude wesley snipes and william forsythe as emanuel levy his book cinema of outsiders the independent the waterdance is coherant attentive to detail with a wicked down to earth it s at and sad and the entire cast is impressive i moved by this film hard hitting yes but also tender moments and laugh out loud moments a rare gem
this is a pretty well known one so i won't get too deep into it the basic story is about two teens who find out about a slimy alien blob of goo that arrives to earth via meteor human contact with this slime ball burns through flesh like acid it also absorbs human bodies making it grow bigger nobody believes the teens mcqueen and his girlfriend and when they finally do it seems that the blob can't be stopped really well done for age and unlike a lot of other flicks the pace is pretty fast the story is very unique making it and a must see for any fan of old sci-fi and monster movies if you can dig the gooey gore of horror be sure to check out the remake from as well
this is by far the funniest short made by the two comic geniuses from the time they walk in to the time hardy just falls off the roof this keeps me laughing hysterically i highly suggest that every fan of laurel and hardy should see this short i also recommend all of the ghost series if you are looking for laughs see this movie and you will be happy
leon was fantastic as always this time playing little richard in his early years the movie showed a fully fleshed out little richard without neglecting to fill the show with lots of great music my only complaint is that the ending was a little abrupt i was hoping for a
i would like to know why john amos left the show and how did he die off the show again i couldn't relate to everything but sometimes they hit home with the problems they were facing by the way did they ever make it out of the ghetto i think the episode with the black jesus was my favorite we got to see them experience a few good times something they didn't have very often i wish they would bring the show back during the daytime so people can actually stay up to watch i don't think a movie or a new show would work especially without the original cast they are really what made good times goodtimes these are my questions and comments thank you
for anyone who liked the series this movie will be something to watch however it also leaves you wanting more i loved the way that every character an appearance least with the ending of who is the fourth chair for they leave a reason for another movie my guess is bayless of course this like the series was a very well put together series of scenes this is a series i wish had lived on thanks to the cast for some wonderful tv
this was obviously the prototype for mick dundee but the adventures of barry mckenzie is funnier i was amused throughout and laughed out loud plenty of times terrific central performance by barry crocker in the title role an australian who invades england to upset the poms with his free-flowing uncouth ways few brits will be upset by frequently cruel observations on his hosts the relationsip between the two countries is prickly but friendly and this is highlighted by the final line delivered by a somewhat reluctant mckenzie as he boards the plane home i was just starting to like the poms
i must admit that i was very sceptical about this documentary i was expecting it to be the kind of all american propaganda that we here in europe dislike so much i was wrong this is not propaganda in fact it is hardly political at depicts the events of through the eyes of the firefighters called to the scene just after the planes crashed it is an amazing coinsidence that this documentary was filmed at all this film was initially shot as a documnetary about a rookie ny firefighter becoming a man we can only thank the film makers that they continued their work during the terrible ordeal that faced great piece of work absolutely stunning material highly
simply great movie no doubt about it great story and superb performances be it amitabh akshay shefali priyanka boman or rajpal hindi film industry is going shameless with mallika and co this movie is totally vulgarity free and therefore bound to fail in vulgarity addicted our indian society but the message and concept this movie carries are absolutely superb anu copy-cat could have been avoided and ismail darbar or himmesh reshmmiya could have been used as musician i think vipul shah should have given little bit gujarati touch particularly in music also anu malik is worst musician around and he thinks himself popstar but this is not the movie where is presence was required-he looks only good with govinda style songs i felt some nice serious music with couple of good ghazals or sad songs could have made this movie more memorable
in cinema retro magazine is revealed that mark voice was actually dubbed by a year old female kathe green although leste was considered perfect for the title role director carol reed was not at all pleased with his singing abilities the secret was revealed by on a uk documentary titled oliver after they were famous greene was paid pounds for her work and she had to agree to keep her participation secret as did mark lester they kept their word and only revealed this fact as part of the tv show decades after release of the film for the record mark lester retired from acting and is a practicing osteopath in england
this movie to me is about family jimmy morris lived his dream not just for himself but for his family i can't begin to tell you how i would be able to tell my little girl that daddy was going to kansas city to cover priest holmes and the kansas city chiefs she'd think it was the coolest thing like morris son did living dreams with the family is what this one is about i think only a father who has a close relationship with his family can truly appreciate what jimmy morris did
the pioneering technicolor cinematography of special technical achievement oscar is indeed enchanting add an endless variety of glamorous costumes and a romantic cinema dream team like marlene dietrich and charles boyer and you've got a rather pleasant the contrived plot as well as the over-blown acting leave much to be desired still there have not been any more breathtaking technicolor films before this one and very few since then that can top this breathtaking visual experience of stunning colors cinema fans who have enjoyed the glorious color cinematography in robin hood jesse james and gone with the wind will not be disappointed in the fantastic work done here the garden of allah will always be synonymous with brilliant color cinematography
george lopez in my opinion is an absolute abc classic i haven't seen every episode but i still enjoy it there are many episodes that i enjoyed one of them was where amy bullock walked into a moving piece of machinery if you want to know why you'll have to have seen it for yourself before i wrap this up i'd like to say that everyone always gave a good performance the production design was spectacular the costumes were well-designed and the writing was always very strong in conclusion even though new episodes can currently be seen i strongly recommend you catch it just in case it goes off the air for good
definitely one of the most witty and twisted who-dunnit i ever seen christopher reeve and micheal caine were brilliant and kept me going through the whole affair classy set pieces and the props really lend a sense of atmosphere to the proceedings the minimalist feel works for the whole only complain isn't with the film itself but the lack of a decent widescreen edition of the movie on dvd i own the fullscreen version proves i love the film enough to endure fullscreen presentation but a awesome deluxe or special edition would most surely get my cash
guy kibbee gives the viewer a lot of laughs like most candidates he knows almost nothing warren william a very under rated actor is superb in giving instructions to kibbee that is he teaches him to say something which means nothing to the voting public a campaign based on no comment i'll take it under advisement and maybe yes but then again maybe no is the nearly perfect way to win an election succinctly the dumber the candidate the greater the chance he or she will win after all the public can identify with such a person with respect to the movie it makes for a lot of comedy
this film was plot was action sequences provided you can lighten up enough to laugh it was a throughly thrilling romp combining keystone cops and the lone baddies were more silly than bad the good guys weren't too good the black actors played normal characters rather than black inclusion of a baby added a good touch sympathy might have been a little difficult otherwise have to disagree about the acting it was on the whole very good i really wanted to punch judge after all isn't that the mark of a really good movie wanting to punch judge reinhold
there should be more movies about our native americans i especially think that using actual real native americans would be the the right thing i know that this archie belaney who was played by pierce brosnan he did an excellent job in portraying that character since he was an englishman but my suggestion to hollywood is to put more american indians into the roles and never use anyone else the sioux nation has been put on the back burner far too long their poverty is a disgrace to our country it is my firm belief that our country should return the black hills to the sioux we ask israel to return their lands to the arabs but we do not make any effort to do the same we should be ashamed of ourselves we must practice what we preach
i've always enjoyed films that depict life as it is life sometimes has boring patches no real plot and not necessarily a happy ending a river runs through it is the perfect name for this film norman novel life ebbs and flows like a river and it has rough spots but it is a wonderful redford brings a lot to the film his narration has a friendly feel that fits the picture perfectly as a director he is restrained and calm and captures some incredibly beautiful scenes as for the acting craig sheffer and brad pitt work surprising well as brothers i don't know quite how to describe tom skerritt and brenda performances except that they truly feel real a river runs through it is a wonderful out of
fabulous costumes by edith head who painted them on liz taylor at her sfx are very good for a movie of its age and the stunt doubles actually looked like the actors even down to body type a rarity in movies of this cozy movie with splendid panoramas even when chopped down to pan and scan
strangely this version of open your eyes is more mature and more nuanced aided by hindsight screenplay is a lot tighter and more fleshed out than original the spanish filmmaker should get credit for thinking of the story first but no doubt that crowe has improved on it if just slightly notice that you have no idea what the lead did in open your eyes but you know almost everything about the lead in vanilla sky what i mean by more fleshed out
a brilliant portrait of a traitor mclaglen in oscar winning performance who is hounded by his own conscience mclaglen plays an ira rouge who betrays his leader to collect a reward during sinn fein rebellion the scenes showing fights and mob actions are very realistic focusing on the desperation within individuals the lack of hope for a better future seems to be a fate worse than john ford superbly creates an murky and tense atmosphere enhanced by the foggy and grimy depiction of the irish landscape max dramatic music score adds to the cinematic delight oscar winner also for best screenplay nominated for best picture this is one of classic
i remember seeing this movie a long time ago back then even though it didn't have any special effects the acting was really good and it still has the same message for today even though the technology has changed maybe they should make a remake of this movie it would be interesting to see a remake i also enjoyed the music from the movie as well larry norman was a really good songwriter during that time period although now most christian music is now worship and praise music i was always curious to know what ever happened to patty after the series ended did she go on to make more movies did she get eventually get married and raise a family i would like to have an update

i reached the end of this and i was almost shouting no no no no it cannot end here there are too many unanswered questions the engagement of the dishwashers disappearance comeuppance the zombie was little brother saved by his father and what about the head argh then i read that at least two of the cast members had passed on and i have to say i know it probably wouldn't be true to lars von vision but i would gladly look past replacement actors just to see the ending he had planned granted it would be hard to find someone to play helmer as the character deserves helmer the doctor you love to hate i think i have yet to see a more self-absorbed oblivious self-righteous character on screen but i could overlook a change in just have to know how it ends
why didn't the producers give that show a chance of all the junk on tv why didn't the producers give six degrees a chance will the series go on video i would love to see how it ends put season one on video and sell it i was a loyal fan of six degrees and waited for return i set my recorder to tape all of the shows thank god for that i just found out that the show was canceled and i'm heart broken i wish i knew it was going to be canceled why didn't they tell us i thought the show was just developing some depth in the characters the writing was pretty good also steven scott is my all time favorite i am so sorry to see it go
i may be biased i am the author of the novel the hungry bachelors club self-published in the screenplay was written by my good friend and hungry bachelor fred dresch who was the inspiration for the character marlon in the film i couldn't be more pleased with the trailer i hope to see the film in its entirety and i will further comment but jorja fox who plays delmar youngblood my character is stellar she carries the bulk of the emotional vehicles in fine form i couldn't have done better myself this looks like real people hardly formula driven and thankfully drives my statement against racial prejudice home gracefully and heartfelt
my interest was raised as i was flipping through and saw the name iphigenia my name is eugenia so i thought ok lets see what this is i am so glad i stayed on the channel what a wonderful wonderful story drama sadness some over the top acting but a wonderful time to be had i watch this and it makes me sad for all the drivel the movie industry puts out and these beautiful little gems get passed over give iphigenia a try and i hope you will enjoy it as much as i did i have even gotten my children and to enjoy it it starts slow however the drama builds and you will be drawn in to the story watching this lovely film made me want to shroud myself in more greek tragedy and pathos
picture bride has an excellent look into past and the people who lived there in that time the time money earned and the hours that these people had put into their lives to survive and live takes a whole new meaning to blood sweat and concept of is something like what we do similar today via the net just that is more of snail mail very slow snail singing of the songs from the workers reminds me of the southern plantation workers songs of their demise and future movie shows the hardship as well as soft romantic scenes that hawaii can bring like the stillness of a storm coming and the sudden chaos of the rain and then the tranquility
rohinton multi-layered novel seemed impossible to adapt for the screen but the resulting movie is filled with passion emotion humour and pathos the story is somewhat slow-moving but there is always something on the screen to captivate the audience the movie perfectly catches a particular time and place with pinpoint accuracy all of the actors are indian few if any known to western audiences but they are a joy to behold especially the little girl who acts very convincingly don't be put off by the title and plot summary this is a movie to be seen on the big screen we have much to learn from it

grey gardens is shocking amusing sad and mesmerizing i watched in amazement as ediths jr and sr bickered and performed while reminiscing of their past their existence in a dilapidated mansion they had not left for more than fifteen years is both a comedy and a tragedy this is a film you will not soon forget
i was a fan of the book ever since third grade so of course i had watched the movie read the sequel and then watched the television show it was a good show in itself and now as an adult i still enjoy the show my only real problem with it was that it didn't follow the book the first time i saw it i was so disappointed that i turned it off but coming from a girl who owns a first addition of the book but after time i decided to give it a try again and ignored the book of like what you have to do with the harry potter movies i found the series wonderful it was clean cut and something that everyone could enjoy just the right amount comedy to keep everyone going it is truly enjoyable clean and wonderful
man some of you people have got to chill this movie was artistic genius instead of searching for reasoning or messages to justify it in your reality why can't you understand that it is a work of fiction a story entertainment for sake pun intended it seems to me that too many of the people on here are trying to be movie they're not doing to well i'm so impressed by the movie and bill job at directing that i'm going to contact him personally to tell him ya know if you weren't trying to analyze the heck out of the possibility of the story line you might just enjoy the film me and all of my friends did
i thought this movie was pretty good some parts were corny but understandable since it was made more than years ago i thought the best performance in the movie was given by michele morgan who played millie convincingly jack haley is also really good as mike o'brien even though i'm not a big frank sinatra fan i think he was very good in this movie if your have a craving for a silly over the top musical comedy higher and higher is the movie for
i finally saw this film tonight after renting it at blockbuster i have to agree that it is wildly original yes maybe the characters were not fully realized but it isn't one of those movies rather we are treated to the eye his vision of what the story is about and it does not stop and to be honest i didn't want it to i do believe that sabu had to have influenced the of lock stock two smoking barrels and run lola run but i absolutely loved the way the three leads see the beautiful woman on the street to distract them momentarily i really need to see this other work because this film really intrigued me if you want insight culture sturm und drang go somewhere else if you want a laugh camera movement and criminal hilarity look here
a wonderful early musical film from rene clair as fun and witty as his silent the italian straw hat using sound in a expressive way and not just for dialogue and effects clair influenced early musicals in america opera scene from a night at the opera is strongly influenced by le million for example should won't be seen by all cinephiles and the dvd from criterion is exactly as good as you'd expect not a ton of extras but most dvd extras i've seen are useless fluff and the clair interview on disc is one i hadn't ever seen get it while still around
the superb star quality of gerard philipe who died way too young leaps from the screen in this witty funny sly swashbuckling comedy with plenty of sword fencing and knockabout antics charmingly loopy in its storytelling impossible to resist a sweet romantic comedy with a very young gina lollobrigida as the love interest a movie one will remember with great affection
scoop is easily woody funniest film of the so far allen although finally looking his age is at the top of his game as low-brow magician sidney waterman his one-liners and demeanor are hilarious don't let the critics sway your opinion scoop is a top notch woody-lite picture classical music score is an excellent compliment to the action on screen scarlett johanson looks gorgeous in that bathing suit jackman is dashing the cinematography glows scoop is wonderful escapist fare from start to finish the last shot of the film alone is worth the admission price
the lady from shanghai is proof that the great genius orson welles could direct a mainstream movie if he wanted to by comparison to his other more artistic works this film has only a moderate amount of craftiness and almost no esoteric exception being of course the final scene in the hall of mirrors widely agreed to be one of the greatest scenes in the history of film it alone is worth the cost of a sweet surprise was the superb acting by the beautiful rita hayworth her acting during the beginning and middle of the film is so excellent she made the other actors appear as caricatures instead of characters even the great mr welles
raggedy ann andy is the first movie i ever saw in the theaters my dad took my sister and i and the funny thing is when we got home dad asked us what do you want to do now and we said we want to watch raggedy ann andy again lol and my dad actually took us back to the theatre to watch it again at least how i remember it i was five years old at the movie was pretty scary for a five year old the scene with the giant ocean of sweets and the hypnotic camel scene i don't remember a lot from this film naturally the beginning was magical and a few scenes i wish i could find it again and will likely seek it out remember i loved raggedy ann andy
allen and julie move into a cabin in the mountains after their daughter is murdered one night no one knows who killed the little girl but why they moved to the mountains so the couple moves into this cabin and haunted by people who killed themselves there and no one in the nearby town wants to talk about movie has a lot of creepiness to it and it has a lot of parts that made me jump some of the parts are predictable but once in a while there is a part i didn't expect it was a pretty good movie that wasn't the scariest movie in the world but it was still scary enough to make it pretty also liked the ending because it left the viewer to decide how it ends it is also kind of a sad movie as well but a well done horror movie
the story and music gershwin are wonderful as are levant guetary foch and of course kelly one missing and that thing is a good leading lady i'm sorry leslie caron bothers me anyway despite her the plot moves along nicely with the famous deservedly so ballet oh the colours the dazzling reds blues greens and yellows musn't forget the beiges as well i just adore the contrast between the beaux arts ball black and white costumes and the ever-so-brilliant i suppose what i'm trying to say is this please by all means see it and enjoy it because though it isn't the best it is marvelous but be sure not to forget that other gene kelly musical with the year old girl that was catapulted to stardom just afterward

jack frost is really a cool movie i funny its violent and very enjoyable most people say that it is b rated but that couldn't be farther from the truth it has great special effects and good acting the only weird thing is of course the killer snowman i think this movie was actually one of the best films of the late-nineties most films these days lack the criteria of a clive barker master piece that is be original and give the viewer what they do not expect jack frost is very cool out of grade ed also recommends the movie uncle sam to fans of jack frost
the thief of baghdad is one of my ten all-time favorite movies it is exciting without gore it is beautifully filmed and the art direction is flawless the casting couldn't have been better rex ingram made me believe in genies and the epitome of evil is certainly captured by conrad veight as jafar he set the bar very watch this movie at least twice a never tire of it this film is an adventure for all too old to enjoy it the thief of bahgdad jogs my memories to a more innocent was ten years old the first time i saw it and the was just about to enter wwii conrad vieght was such a great actor that he was able to continue this underlying evilness a few years later in casablanca and korda teamed believe with justin and dupree again in the four film-making

this started out to be a movie about the street culture of the bronx in new york what it accomplished was to give birth to a new culture and way of life for american youth what other movie has done this except rebel without a cause one of the most important movies of all time the elements are simple yet fascinating the story is timeless young people try to succeed against all odds yet the story is always believable and never depressing the characters are so realistic a city dweller would recognize them as neighbors the story is entertaining and comes to a satisfying ending buy this one for your permanent collection it is a piece of american history
this is not a love one word summary of this film would be probably won't appeal to the mass movie watching public that forces you to participate you observe think and could be made with deliverance with the blair witch project for overall filming this film stands unique against cinematography effects freeze frame blur been seen before but they are used most effectively in to underpin the natural tension of the is raw menacing and utterly real theme of the film is about friendship the title really game away probably not the kind of friendship that most have experienced or indeed would want is a love song
i cannot begin to describe how amazing this movie is suffice it to say anytime i'm depressed about how unfair or futile things seem this is the movie i go rent to put me in the right frame of mind the background music makes you realize the easiness of existence and how simplicity provides for the greatest happiness the indian girl that sings is but one example of a character in this film who does not try hard and is happy as a result persifina the laundry co-worker of judd is eyes and smile could make the hardest day i watch this movie and i dream of better days to come or of a good conversation with friends and i realize that being is alone quite the same as being lonely recommended for anyone who enjoys a thoughtful lull of a movie
since i first saw this in the theater it has been my favorite since then i've seen it countless times and i never get tired of it the setting has a lot to do with it colorado i know would be jealous but the storyline is original and i liked how it used small town mountain folk as the heroes there has not been a movie i can compare this too john lithgow plays a smart villain but i love how he is completely out of his has to follow tucker around and what keeps it interesting this is an action movie at best i don't think i'll see another that is so don't need rounds fired to qualify as an action movie it just has to keep you captivated not shell-shocked
i only watched this because it starred josie lawrence who i whose line is it anyway the wacky british show i was very pleasantly surprised by this heartwarming and magical gem it is uplifting touching without being sappy or sentimental the characters real people with real foibles fears and needs see it
i thought this was an utterly charming film the story seems to be a thinly veiled autobiography of john waters greatest gift is his ability to find beauty in unexpected places edward furlong does well in the lead but the best performances are by his grandmother mink stole hilarious cameo and of all people patty hearst i think the reviewers are way off base on this one they seem to be taking worst valuation of his work as gospel when i think the film pretty clearly states that he is indeed a promising artist
i agree with everyone who says that this series was the best of the spy genre my husband and i were captivated by it when it first aired in the us and watched every episode i tried at that time to purchase the series did tape all of it but was told by wgbh that it was not available i even considered writing to ian holm to see if he might have a copy like others i purchased and read the deighton series part to understand the complicated plot if the original version ever comes available on dvd i'll be among the first in line to snap up a copy ian portrayal of the vulnerable but courageous bernard samson was amazing is always amazing
got the gold is the last of the hanzo the razor films starring shintaro katsu as the title character the multi-weapon proficient authority-bucking samurai officer with the unique technique of raping confessions out of unwilling female informants until they spill the beans and beg for entry starts with hanzo uncovering a woman who poses as a ghost to guard a lake filled with bamboo trunks filled with gold stolen from the treasury this leads to hanzo discovering a loan-sharking scheme and an orgy ring run by a blind monk the requisite swordplay and ensue finalizing in a decent ending for this strange trilogy of quite as strong and enjoyable as the snare of the series but still great for fans of samurai sleaze and japanese pinky-style films
great great great that is all i can say about that movie but imdb want at least four lines of text so i'll elaborate the cast was great o'connel is soooo cute the music was great sixties had the best music ever imho the historical material was interesting and so was the way they made the actors of the seem like they were actually there in the and most of all the stories of the main characters brought tears to my eyes and that is the greatness of any drama but in one word great
i enjoyed this movie unlike like some of the pumped up steroid trash that is passed off as action movies playing god is simple and realistic with characters that are believable action that is not over the top and enough twists and turns to keep you interested until the directed well acted and a good story
i am a big fan a faerie tale theatre and i've seen them all and this is one of the best funny romantic and a classic i recommend this for all ages great for little kids because well cinderella and great for adults and teen because funny and not over the top i watched it when i was little and i still watch it now it has great lines that my family and i quote all the time the acting is great and it never gets old if you like fairy tales and romances you will love this i've watched many a cinderella movie in my time and this is the best of them all disney i highly recommend this movie and all the faerie tale theatre shows they all appeal to all ages and are all unique and very entertaining
how can't you rate this movie with i admit to say that this movie is not very entertaining but the goal is not to tell you a story but history this is the first movie of cinema history prince de galles was first but it was not technically perfect enough and it has an undoubtedly huge international value these people that you can see finishing their working day in the movie had the chance to participate to a historic moment becoming the first persons to be able to see themselves moving and above all the shot is a beautiful shot and very moving when you think about the first persons to have seen that what a moment historic for science first the lumiere brothers first invented the cinematographe for scientific reasons and for art later a movie to venerate
i have only managed to see this classic for the first time a few weeks ago being made almost years ago i thought the scary moments would be rather tame boy was i wrong there are some great moments that sent shivers down my spine even the acting was great jamie lee curtis was fantastic and donald pleasance was the downside it can be rather slow to start but once it gets going there is no stopping it it makes all the copycats nightmare on elm street scream look very tame i can't really say it is best because i have not seen many of his the only one i can remember of his is starman think he made it halloween is the crowning achievement of the horror genre
always fancied this film from the video cover eventually got round to buying it for a fiver in a sale and boy what a film a simply stunning performance from all of the case and filmed so beautifully even at times from a distance so you can barely hear what the dialogue is as if you really are that distance away picking up bits of the tale really moving frequently amusing and very watchable not much dialogue but is filmed in such a way that you feel so much throuout a from me a must see

riding giants is an incredible documentary detailing the history and stories of three influential big-wave surfers gregg noll jeff clark and laird hamilton stacy peralta did an amazing job taking on the role of director and should be congratulated for doing such a brilliant job the structure of the film is edited brilliantly and works perfectly with the narration interviews animation and surfing footage the music soundtrack just adds to the overall satisfaction of watching this film making riding giants brilliant viewing personal highlights include any of greg comments what with his straight-to-the-point frankness laird footage at teahupoo and the out-takes at the end of the movie but really this entire film is one big recommended highlight that comes highly recommended if you have the opportunity to see a shame it isn't more well known but it is a gem deserving of attention

i saw this movie sunday afternoon i absolutely loved this movie i loved everything about it from the sappy moments of mothers and daughters to the scenes where mamie gummer is crying because of her poor decision in marrying a man for her parents and not because she is truly in love i loved these moments because they were just so real at first i was seriously scared because i was hoping that it would not end up like bobby which was a great cast but a poorly written movie with no real meat to it but during the middle of the movie i felt completely different you will laugh and you will cry but in the end you will want to see evening one more time trust me when i say go see it
this is a very rare example of a movie about transvestitism heterosexuals the film treats the taboo theme so that even a general audience not knowing of transvestitism at all will strongly sympathize with its main character adrian pasdar is very believable as and shall not be forgot for this brillant acting the directing of christopher monger is very sensitively treating such a difficult issue quite excellently packed into a good story not a big movie neither an art film but a little lovely motion picture
i saw this movie yesterday on turner and i was unable to stop watching until it was over even though i sort of could guess what would happen farrell was great in her role and everyone else did a super job some of it seemed to stretch the limits but all in all i loved it if you get the chance to see it please do i actually cried at a few scenes but then i guess if you are a mom you would loretta is beautiful and i was just in astonishment at the very idea of their being unwed moms there it seemed ahead of its time i say watch it if you can and don't listen to criticisms as they say i laughed i cried i thoroughly enjoyed it
for those of us baby boomers who arrived too late on the scene to appreciate james dean et al martin sheen showed us the way in this great premise is easy enough cool hood meets small town sheriff and all-hell ensues but the nuts and bolts of this movie enthrall the car nut in all of us this isn't casablanca nor is it great literature but it is a serious movie about cars rebellion and the genius that is martin this and appreciate it for what it is and for what martin will become i loved this movie growing up as a teen in the and you will too
a very addictive had not seen an exact combination among drama action suspense and sci-fi never before i am impressed every chapter the screenplay is very intelligent i don't know how the creators invent all this amazing stories every character have a strange past troubles stormy relationships it gives to the show the human sense needed for creating intimate most incredible is the fact that all the characters are related among them the numbers they have met before without knowing it and so on the others enigmatic security system and the darma initiative are elements that don't let us lose a jj abrams what did you think to create this amazing story
when i saw this as a child it answered all of my questions and dispelled any fears or misconceptions that i had it is easy to watch because it is animated which makes it unthreatening it has no moral bias or preachy aspects so nobody should have any objections to it it is a pleasant film that simply gives the facts of menstruation in a reassuring matter-of-fact way i hope to show it to my daughter
i'm not much of an expert on acting or other movie details but this movie just hit me deep i don't think i'll ever forget it one scene especially think that anybody who has seen the film will know of which one i am speaking is imprinted on my also watched the similar movie lilja referred to by a previous commentator it was also very moving but not quite as straight to the point and brutal if you are sensitive at all either will bring tears to your eyes but anjos do sol of the sun may stay with you is very depressing subject matter but i think no i hope that the film succeeds in bringing more attention to people need to see this film
i don't think i need to tell you the story for it has been told for years and years so i will just share my feelings i first saw cinderella was when i was five years old from then on i was a disney child in a good way the animation now seems childish and old fashioned but that is part of its charm now now in the age of high school musical and computer generated images it seems like people have forgotten the genius and magical essence of early disney movies thankfully i was born before that so i was introduced to this classic and it seems no matter how old i get i turn back into that five year old watching it on vhs which is the true magic of disney
this was without a doubt the best of the dirty harry series from the opening credits you're swept up in a revenge tale that hits hard and is profoundly engrossing sondra locke is perfect in the role of a traumatized woman out for revenge eastwood has many aside sequences that have nothing to do with the plot but show harry at his bad-assed best loaded with unforgettable characters in minor roles this film rocks and should serve as the standard for flicks this is the one dirty harry flick raw and devoid of any fluff i can watch this again and again not in one sitting because a gratifying out for revenge yarn the pace is quick and several of the scenes are unforgettable go ahead make my feel lucky punk classic eastwood as only eastwood with his anguished rubbery expressions and whispery menacing voice can do it

this is an excellent movie it is about many things the hunt for a serial killer the bureacracy of soviet russia the drive of one man and the relationship between this man lead detective and his thing that sticks with me the most is the relationship between durokov and fetisov bad spelling please for some reason it is moving to see their evolution from hostility and offense turning into respect and cameraderie and working together one line in the movie sums it up for me he would say something witty but he is overcome with acting by all of the cast even the smallest parts were done with is not a fast-paced action thriller in fact it moves at times like a slow drama but it is worth it very satisfying and not exploitative about the crimes at
just caught it at the toronto international film festival this is a good story told in a compelling way the handheld camera approach to action scenes added to the intensity of those scenes a documentary style not a blair witch style joel schumacher shows he doesn't need a big budget to produce a gripping actors were strong particularly the actor playing the focus of the events in the film boz
all the acting done in the first season has been really amazing the first look you get of max and zach is through geneva locke and chris lazar or as i like to call them the minis the minis do the best acting job that i have ever seen kids do the main actors and actresses jessica alba michael weatherly etc make you forget you are watching a fictional show they seem to make this show come alive all in all this is the best show i have ever watched
this unsung quiet gem tells the true story of a pow escape during ww ii the performances are incredible especially anthony steele the movie works on many different levels cerebral emotional visual and literal the dialogue is ingenious and rings very true in fact an unusual all-around authenticity puts this one head-and-shoulders above most war epics

went to see this as me and my lady had little else to do on a sunday afternoon i like films that deal with characters and this is full of em after a slow start we get some good turns from the cast but it is the actual bellini that both makes and lets the film down the bellini is one of the funniest scenes i have seen in a film for a long while but is too short and could have made this a masterpiece overall out of

strangely erotic schlock gothic horror that will be loved by hammer house of horror fans the world over appears to be an interesting take on beauty and the beast it is definitely worth a look and surprisingly well acted when taking into consideration the genre and castles rutting horses rampaging faux fur monsters in the woods proof that no-one had a brazilian in the and more bodily fluids than you can shake a stick at what more could you possibly certainly brightened my sunday afternoon
i was in a bad frame of mind when i first saw this movie for some reason it clicked on all my levels tensions in a family loneliness and the want of someone to share your life with it didn't hurt that the someone to share your life with was such a beautiful girl as claire preston i also bought the sound track to this movie hard to get loved it and hope it will someday come out on dv
this movie is a real gem the arc of the the plot is defined in the first minutes the characters are sympathetic and clearly drawn their motives completely believable the dialogue is fresh and oh so real the situations are unique to the characters and not at all cliched or hackneyed until the climax that is then as if the movie went off the rails a bit and it got a bit hokey and unbelievable but i don't want to discourage people from watching this film the first of it are truly remarkable i gave it an there are some remarkable performances here check out this movie
interesting way of looking at how we as humans so often behave we are sometimes blinded by our desire to achieve perfection that we some times destroy the foundation of what we are trying to achieve it also addresses the issue how we tend to ignore those among us who are not as outspoken and by doing this may miss out on a great opportunity the injection of comedy also makes watching the film an enjoyable must see for anyone who is interested in a reflective yet comical look at life i am eagerly looking forward to your next that you will continue to provide us with quality entertainment excellent work joanne
if you are tired of films trying too hard to be fairy tales pretty woman variety love story here is a beautiful film in which a japanese businessman is pulled free from his robotic dispassionate life when he falls in dancing wonderfully drawn characters bring to life a story that is at once deeply funny and poignantly moving
i had the opportunity to see this film debut at the appalachian film festival in which it won an award for best picture this film is brilliantly done with an excellent cast that works well as an ensemble my favorite performances were from youssef kerkour justin lane and adam jones also there are some great effects with dragonflies and cockroaches that i was surprised to find out that this film was done on a small budget the writer-director adam jones who i believe also won an award for his writing does an excellent job with direction the audience loved this movie cross eyed will keep you laughing throughout the movie definitely a must see
i saw this movie when it came out when i was years old and into classic rock am never liked opera before because i hate soprano voices but he changed all that he was adorable in the movie and had such an amazing voice heard on cnn that he died tonight at home of pancreatic cancer he will be missed and he definitely left his mark on this hope to buy this movie if i can find it watch and enjoy maybe i should head over to and have a look before sold out
interesting fast-paced and not one of those people who watches loads and loads of television i stumbled across this show while home sick with a bad case of the flu one day and was immediately hooked i developed quite a crush on john burke both he and claire did an amazing job of hosting the show together you could really tell that they both loved their super-collector segments were excellent i found myself interested in things i had never previously given a single thought i would really like to know is whatever happened to jack the dog did one of the hosts adopt him
the star of this film is the screenplay attention to detail for the period in dress language social mores we don't hurt women and the politics are remarkable it is a reminder of kosovo to-day the subtle pieces in the action scenes are there for an attentive viewer and the choreography of these action sequences is superb perhaps this film is to close to the bone of reality to earn the support it should have received it is like a staircase of increasing violence with well paced pauses of peace and serenity between each step a great film
peter falk is a diverse and accomplished actor the movie is well written and the acting seems like real life for all lovers of columbo this is a superior piece of work because it shows what a talent peter falk is he doesn't play a detective he plays a retired carpet salesman by the time the credits begin to role you already want to watch it again the interesting part of the movie is that the message will apply to every person that watches it the depth of its pertinence will be the only thing that varies it is a shame that the liberals in hollywood only promote smut and skin because this is the type of movie that the people in the business should be proud of this would be a great movie to turn into a live stage play
like other people who commented on fräulein doktor i stumbled by chance upon this little gem on late-night tv without having heard of it before the strange mixture of a pulp fiction story about a sexy but unscrupulous anti-heroine on the one hand and a realistic and well-researched portrayal of war in the trenches on the other hand had me hooked from the me this is one of the five best movies about wwi others are all quiet on the western front paths of glory gallipoli and the post-war la vie et rien d'autre and the scene with the poison gas attack is really chilling the horses and men appear like riders of the apocalypse with their gas only wish i had taped the film
this is the finest film ever made to deal with the subject of aids a documentary about two men living with and dying of this illness the film is beautiful heartbreaking funny and incredibly moving above all it is an amazing true love story be sure to have a few hankies ready before you watch this will need them extraordinary
heart pounding erotic drama are the words that come to mind when i think of secret games it becomes more erotic as the film goes along and at one point blew me away i didn't expect the delightful scene i was about to encounter the call girl has her first customer and what a customer one of the most erotic lesbian scenes i have ever seen the husband should have listened to his wife and perhaps she wouldn't have gone on this erotic journey it turned out to cost them in the end but it was one exciting ride go see this movie
this movie shows life in northern cameroon from the perspective of a young french girl france dalens whose father is an official for the colonial government and whose family is one of the few white families around it gives a sense of what life was like both for the colonists and for the natives with whom they associated a sense consistent with another movie i've seen about africa in a similar time period in afrika but i have no way of knowing how realistic or typical it is not just an impression things do happen in the movie but the plot is understated the viewer is left to draw his own conclusions rather than having the filmmakers forced upon him although the framing of the story as a flashback from the visit to south-western cameroon as an adult provides some perspective
this movie is completely ridiculous not only is the plot atrocious but the acting is horrendous the special effects are asinine and the entire movie is set in a post-apocalyptic desert yet it is by far the most amusing movie ever given permission to be produced it is minutes of laughs due to the fact that we all know there will be no fuel in the year or any el there are also other aspects which i will not spoil just because they are what makes the movies so wonderfully moronic i highly recommend this movie just because of its utter idiocy i have no idea who would watch this expecting it to be a high quality feature but if a good laugh is what you need watch exterminators of the year
as a horse lover one can only appreciate this movie there are few movies that show horsemanship as this one does i would love to know if brian does his own riding in the film would also like to know if he enjoys horses brian has been in a lot of movies where he has ridden where did he learn to ride the only part that is hard for me to take is that the riding scenes are always full tilt like a horse can run forever at full steam the camera-work is first rate and captures the horses in a way that shows how dangerous things can be on top of a horse it would be very interesting to know how they went about casting this movie to find all of the very good horseback riders
ok even if you can't stand this movie is truly hilarious the scenes with john gielgud make up for liza one of the true romantic comedy classics from the century dudley moore makes being drunk and irresponsible look cute and amusing and it is damn fun to watch the one-liners are the best
this movie consists of such great emotion especially with its outstanding soundtrack that coincides with the film tom cruise is one of my favorite actors because of his enthusiasm to make films and to entertain this movie was not the best the first time i watched it but after about more times i decided that this is one of the best films that i have ever seen it takes place in new york and progresses on through his lifestyle he discovers a delimma in his life with his girlfriend he goes through a state of depression and then an outgoing blend of imagination this film was beyond my expectations and is one of best films ever
this beautiful story of an elder son coming home and learning to love and be a part of all those things that he left home to get away from is poignant and moving it shows a society that is perhaps strange to us in the western world with a sense of family that we have lost the story is beautiful sad and at times funny and comic it has a feeling of realism that we don't seem to see any longer in our western acting is unusual in that as the movie progresses it almost gives the impression that it is not acting but a documentary of ordinary people this is brilliant directing and movie love to see more movies by this director
mystery men has got to be the stupidest film i've ever seen but what a film i thought it was fabulous excellent and impressive it was funny well-done and nice to see ridiculous super heroes for a change and being able to pull it off this was great i'll definitely watch it again
amazing movie that in theory should be boring but is delivered with subtlety and incredible acting that i have long despaired of ever finding instead of relying on clichés and overly dramatized moments the plot unfolds through a series of incredibly realistic moments the lead characters are not perfect and so relating to them as people you could know is easy the movie is not trying to pull laughs or push an ideal onto the audience but simply showing us the possibility of true love in any circumstance am now restless waiting for the weekend so i can see the sequel a moving thought provoking funny look at love that i think should be an absolute romantic classic up there with casablanca and breakfast at will soften even the hardiest heart
the novel is easily superior and the best parts of the film are direct translations from what greene wrote for instance the quiet but grim humour that breaks into the scenes with boyer and lorre or the murdered-child obsession that takes over some of the plot where the film deviates from the novel it tends to the i don't want to suggest that the film is bad in any way it always looks the part and the story stays in the mind like a good un some of the minor characters were stock actors who could turn their hand to a dreadful shame that the not available on dvd
just came back from the first showing of basic instinct i was going into it thinking it would be crappy based on preview critics and i was pleasantly surprised if you liked the original basic instinct i think you will enjoy just as much if not more great story that always keeps you wondering and thinking the music is superb reprising the theme don't go expecting academy award material go to see it for enjoyment and fun what movies are designed for escapism i can't think of a better way to escape than to escape with sharon stone who is as sexy as she ever was am thinking about going to see it again this weekend go see it
thanks to a smart script and a steady hand from kevin meyer perfect alibi is an entertaining and very likable mystery thriller the movie starts methodically and builds up steam as the clues begin to reveal that nothing is what it seems to be teri garr and hector elizondo are terrific as they team up to unravel the mystery reminding me of nick and nora charles from the thin man movies kathleen quinlan is excellent as alex tormented wife and the character roles played by veteran actors charles martin smith bruce mcgill anne ramsey and estelle harris are well done and provide plenty of light moments at just the right time even a cameo by rex linn in all i felt like i was reading a good book by the fire
this is a fantasy movie for kids based on the boggy creek legend although i don't know why they called it return to boggy creek as if a movie has nothing to do with the documentary and its fantasy kiddie fare dawn wells stars as the mother of children who get lost in the swamp around boggy creek with other men and the monster comes to their aid yes very silly and the plot is corny but this kind of movie is perfect for the group which it targeted harmless g-rated kiddie fare and at least you don't have to worry about leaving your kids alone while they watch it strictly for the set older kids will get bored and think it lame
purple rain what else can i say the title speaks for itself but i think all the actors were well picked the movie had a great story i loved it ever since i watched that movie i've been stuck in the eighties and i'm only my favorite part of the movie was when his father died and he was picking up all of his music compositions and the apollonia was sitting on the stairwell with his earing in her hand critics say that its a drama but i think its more of a romance murphy brown also did a great job in the movie he actually acted like himself i'm so glad i've seen this movie the song purple rain beautifully sung was so heartfelt i cried more than once
we often see movies about undesirable things going on in politics but i still recommend city hall in a role he was born to play al pacino stars as new mayor who has to deal with the shooting of a boy but it turns out that nothing that he does will really have any effect in this movie the characters are as gritty as we would expect of anyone involved in a political scandal no matter how much you trust any given politician you may have your doubts after watching this understand that i can't name any specific example of something similar to what this movie portrays but not the point if we had idealistic impressions of those at the top this movie tears such ideas down certainly one that i encourage you to see also starring john cusack bridget fonda danny aiello anthony franciosa and david paymer
jack frost is about a serial killer who is sentenced to death on the way to his death sentence the prison truck that he rides in collides with a chemical tanker filled with a chemical that turns his molecules with the snow on the ground turning him into a snowman being a killer himself that would turn him into a killer snowman jack now wants revenge on the sheriff who caught him jack now starts his rampage all over again killing people in a small don't think jack frost has a chance of becoming a horror classic but its a entertaining flick just put your brain on hold and have fun with it but just don't take it too seriously
this was a very good movie i wished i could find it in vhs to really enjoyed this movie i would definaetly recommend this movie to watch i would like to see it again but can never find it in tv it would be well worth the time to watch it again
lots and lots of information to digest and if you've seen zizek you know his if you haven't seen most of the films or at least some other films by the same directors mentioned in this doc you will be somewhat lost the film list is long director includes hitchcock vertigo birds lynch falls wild at heart blue velvet tarkovsky solaris and the are some segway films like star wars espisode iii matrix but these i suspect are baits to be sure zizek is never boring but if you don't buy if you mind the psycho analytics then you'll be annoyed to no end you should not be as the setting clips the way the film interleave with these clips points are never boring
generally difficult to rate these films some of the segments can be quite good while others bring down the rating of the overall product in this one for instance the all-girl scene in the office was quite of the best in this viewing history then segment the lady is always entertaining and the story that binds the whole together was an interesting concept the swap scene that closes out the offering ain't bad either technically the production values are fairly high recommended
i loved this masterpiece and quite frankly i too found mary poppins i love julie andrews and dick vandyke to be silly and sacrine-sweet angela lansbury plays her character to perfection and i don't know why people think of this film as distorted it was magical and it was lots of fun to watch every scene held a certain charm as you got to know the characters better you truly see how this little thrown together family learn to bond with each other despite their age and differences i thought the characters were well developed especially charles who was at the age of not believing mary poppins may be more popular and cherished by others but this little gem will be the one that i will always love and cherish
yes the plot is hardly plausible and very thin yes the acting does range from average to laughable yes it has been done so many times before however what we are dealing with is a film that does not shy away from these facts and pretends to be nothing more than it is there are indeed some original death scenes and the tension does increase throughout the movie in addition you are never more than a few minutes away from a gory killing i urge everyone to watch this film with an unprejudiced eye and see it for what it set out to be a scary funny slasher flick with a theme tune second to none
to be honest i watched this movie only because of my pubert needs i mean i couldn't get women at my age was or so i thought watching cleavage was the closet thing to ended up having a great time with this cult classic about horror comedy halloween parties sassy humor and some sexy evil displayed by just don't make movies like this anymore it had the feeling of an amateur effort mixed with a late night cable talk show host style truth is that it generated plenty of fans because of humor and the ability to perform by cassandra is classic that reminds me of the good days of usa up all night
noir quality in this saturated and intense pulp film is seemingly perfectly fit together shot by shot edit by edit the film unfolds itself around a disturbed boxer discovering his own purpose lack thereof the other comments around perhaps indicate a lack of pulp interest but i personally think this is a superbly put together cinematic piece
of all the movies i have seen and most of them this is by far the best one made that is primarily about the naval airships during the ww-ii era yes there are other good lta related movies but most use special effects more than any real-time shots this navy has considerably more real-time footage of blimps etc true lots of corny dialog but what makes more interesting hollywood movies even today i spent of and have over hours in navy airships of all types from through proud member of the naval airship association etc usn retired
what a good film made men is a great action movie with lots of twists and turns james belushi is very good as an ex hood who has stolen million from the boss who has to fend of the gangsters hillbillies his wife and the local timothy wont be disappointed jump on board and enjoy the ride out of
as the maker of this darkness i admit we neglected very important acknowledgments in our end credits the omissions were over-sights that could not be corrected once committed nor did the parties involved who saw the movie mention it at the time on behalf of the excellent cast and crew of the film i extend them an apology obviously some criticisms posted here are harsh in light of their credit being accidentally our production values were negligible and our special effects were quite special indeed but the plot is very strong and the cinematography by john mcleod is superb we hope you the reader enjoy this darkness and the efforts of those who worked their butts off for free thank you dylan o'leary director
there are not many movies around that have given me a feeling like stardust did all throughout the course of the film as magically fairy-tale-like as the princess bride stardust is most definitely the most wonderful fantasy spectacle of the as well as the exciting hilarious and equipped with wonderful imagery as well as unforgettable characters michelle pfeiffer and robert especially i challenge anyone to watch this movie without a smile from the first ten minutes of the film you know perfectly well how it will end but it is the journey and not the destination that enthralls the viewer from start to stars and not a decimal less
i saw this movie on comedy central a few times this movie was pretty good an interesting adventure with the life of sunny davis who is arranged to marry the king of ohtar so that the can get an army base there to balance power in the middle east some good jokes including sunnygate i also just loved the ending theme it gave me great political spirit ten out of ten was my rating for this movie
it wasn't me it was er my twin brother rupert bobby says to dugan when confronted about being over at place i have used this line dozens of times over the years one has yet to believe it movie is one of the all-time best for sheer fun and nonbelieveability steven oliver was perfect for the part of dugan so much so that he was in malibu beach as the same character nearly as much screen time calls dugan a turd is another line for the ages this classic film was definitely worth the price of admission
does anyone know what kind of pickup john t drove i looks like a mid to late ford this movie is my favorite as well as my it was the first memorable movie we saw as a married couple the pick up is of interest as it is similar to the first truck i drove and recently found another like it i would like to restore the pick up i have to resemble the on in the movie also the music was awesome and the acting was great where and what is the lady who portrayed aunt also did john have a stunt double for the scene on the tower when he almost fell also what year of mustang did debra w drive in this show it looked like a model thanks
i was an usherette in an old theater in northern california when this movie came out as good as it is on dvd even more eerie and terrifying on the big screen although it has been about years since i have seen it it is still one of my all-time favorites at the risk of sounding trite they just don't make em like this anymore if sixth sense freaked you out at all this movie is definitely for you great storyline incredible cast of characters ominous setting even the soundtrack has a haunting quality to it i highly recommend you not watch it alone what a brownstone apartment was renting for in alone will have you gasping would be at least that price today
a somewhat typical bit of filmmaking from this era obviously it was first conceived into this world for the stage but nonetheless a very good film from beginning to end peter o'toole and susannah york get to do their stage performance act for the silver screen and both do it effectively there is very little in the way of story and anyone not familiar with this type of off beat character study may be a little put off by it all in all though a good film in which peter o'toole and susannah york get to overact
ko to tamo peva is one of the best films i ever saw a tragicomedy with very deep implications on the fate of humankind shown through the eyes of seemingly very plain and common people from a god-forsaken serbian province just before the start of the world war ii i saw it in a small movie theater in russia where the film had had a very limited distribution and i had no chance to come across it ever since it is such a pity that this excellent film is almost forgotten now i searched for a vhs or dvd copy of it many times and alas could find none i would be most grateful to other fans of this little gem of movie-making for a suggestion of the ways to purchase a copy
i have seen my fair share of comedy and standup movies but this one is so original so fresh it will make you wonder why you always walked right pass it in the video store murphy has some pretty raunchy jokes but this is just too funny to pass if only every movie could be this funny it should be called minutes of the most incredible comedy murphy is a comic genius in this film and will make you say this is the guy that did dr doulittle he talkes about the ice cream man shoe throwing mothers his aunt with a mustache racism and everything else you could possibly think of and the ones you couldnt please if you ever see one comedy in your life this is it if only all movies could be delirious
i think the context of the story has been covered by other posters so i would just like to write about the impact this film had on first saw this film the year of release around my school organised a trip to the cinema to see it for an re project i think we all went along of course excited because we were on a school trip to the cinema little did we know what we were about to experience to this day i still remember the feelings it invoked in me and i remembered crying a lot as were most of my friends i think at the age we were we found it shocking and quiet rightly outraged in our own youthful way it had such an impact on me that i joined the anti apartheid movement the same think it served purpose in my case
with part reconstruction and part direct shooting the directors made a formidably limpid documentary on a coup d'état against president chavez in venezuela organized by a foreign secret service and fully supported by the wealthy venezuelan minority the political opposition the church cynical laughing cardinal and the us government it was another chapter in the history of us foreign policy which steven kinzer calls overthrow or democracy american style in fact this foreign backed intervention was not only a coup d'état against president chavez but also against the democratic majority which elected him this is a brilliant documentary is mightily confirmed by the violent reactions for and against it on internet as saint augustine said men love truth when it bathes them in its light they hate it when it proves them movie is a must see for all those who want to understand the world we live in
i love this show sure to be a winner jessica alba does a great job about time we have a kick-ass girl not the cutesy type the entire cast is wonderful and all the episopes have good plots everything is layed out well and thought over to put it together must have taken a while because it wasn't someone in a hurry that just slapped something together a great show altogether
my left foot in my opinion is a great biopic about one of the most talented authors and painters the performances were smashing the soundtrack was great and the casting was perfect i thought that christy day-lewis was a very talented man although i couldn't understand what he was saying most of the time in addition when he threw a tantrum i got a little scared also just so sad that he suffered from cerebral palsy in conclusion if you are a die-hard fan of daniel day-lewis or like biopics i highly recommend this great biopic about one of the most talented authors and painters you're in for a real treat and a good time so don't miss this one
japanese indie film with humor and philosophy where the three main characters run literally almost through the entire film chasing each other due to strange circumstances and comical coincidence as they are running we see what is going on in their minds and how they got where they are at the moment the act of running is a metaphor for these down-on-their luck lives in some way what they're really chasing for is not what they were originally chasing but for meaning in their lives and an escape from their personal problems and broken dreams running makes them all feel truly alive the big life-altering running adventure comes to an end when they accidentally get in the middle of something big violent and so absurd that funny in a clever way one of my favorite films of all time by genius director sabu
writers perry and randy howze crafted a very engaging little story in chances are the idea of a reincarnated man who happens to return to his former home many years later the plot takes unexpected delightful four year old robert downey jr renders a delightful performance ably assisted by cybil shepherd as the widow and ryan o'neal as a good friend trio has just the right chemistry for this caper playing off one another with a graceful style i've watched this film a number of times on tv and each time found it most enjoyable
i've been watching this every night on this past week this is a terrific revealing portrait about the drugs epidemic and how drugs were displayed in the media during the late and on through the death of morrison hendrix joplin are all here has fashioned a complete intricate portrayal of the life and times during the drug years from the sanfrancisco bay area to studio this documentary shows the evolution and advancement of the drug business and the death and new life it breathed into the american marijuana to lsd to cocaine this documentary shows the ways drugs were getting into the country the hippie movement the conservative resistance and how drugs effected the arts movies etc featuring tons of fascinating interviews and news reel films the trip easy rider up in smoke reefer madness blow boogie nights
i saw this movie recently hours later my head still hurt from laughing the plot was soo awful the jokes were soo bad but what i didn't count on the scenes before and after the movie that had pat and jay posing caused more than enough the kick through the windshield that decapitated the movie is about times better than the rush hour series and my copy even came with a disclamer saying if you didn't like the movie send certificate to hbo while i considered it the date you had to send it in was january also caused wackiness to ensue
it really is a shame that films like this never snag best picture nominations because this one is simply a winner this is by far the most consistently hilarious comedy i have ever seen its screenplay and design are impeccable not to mention the incredible cast i can quote this movie for hours on end watch it
this movie has taken a lot of stick it was slated by critics when it came out and was blamed for wrecking nicolas career the thing i don't think people get is that not meant to be an epic oscar contender of a movie just some brilliant bruck-buster action at its best fast cars quick editing and a great soundtrack it does exactly what it says on the tin also for anyone who likes cars its a pure treat it has everything ferraris mercs a hummer and lets not forget eleanor i think you'd be hard pushed to find a better action movie and personally a better movie at all then again maybe just me
the road rovers was a great show about canine superheroes chosen by the master to fight crime around the world the show was hilarious to say the least simple and complex jokes that could appeal to all ages running jokes throughout the series that could spawn a drinking game the action was mesmerizing and cleverly set up the characters were very original each with a very different personality but what made me enjoy the show the most was the depth of the characters each of them have struggles and emotional difficulties that are never expressed but implied in subtext hopefully one day there'll be some way to watch the rovers in action again
saw this in the theater in and fell out of my chair laughing more than once do you know about the best damn baseball that ever know how going to end but it has a great time getting there the training scenes are very funny but the best scene may be the one when jack and reno are attempting to watch the falcons v vikings monday night football game while attempting a make-up dinner with their and russell seem to have a lot of fun with this one and too bad that overlooked as a top notch comedy
after seeing you've got mail and feeling disappointed i decided to see the original movie which inspired this one the shop around the corner i was amazed at this movie a true gem and from this moment one of my favorite movies of all times the acting is so perfect the story is so beautiful that if you haven't seen it i wish to urge you to see it today i'm not against re-makes and sometimes i like the new version more than the original one but this time have to admit that you've got mail is a poor adaption of this classic don't miss it go to your video store and rent the shop around the corner today
ahead make my day fourth picture in the series is directed by eastwood himself was rumored of directing most of magnum force and he brings back the violent society from the first two films however the film still lacks impact and believability this film was released in the early the time of regan and the young republicans the premise of a raped woman taking vengeance on her rapist doesn't appeal to this time frame this plot would have been better for the enforcer which actually would have made it a good movie what sudden impact needed was a plot like in wall street but with dirty harry in the middle stars
me and my sister saw the premiere last night it was so good we were glued for the whole thing think i'm hooked for the season they have some really good actors in this thing the head coach guy and the player that likes pete were very good and the plot has already got me but i don't really understand how they'll keep it stretched for a whole season there will probably be some big twist cant wait till tuesday finally jeremy sumpter who is he i can tell hes going to be big he was soo good we fell in love with his character right away cant wait for the next episode go
this is a nice piece of work very sexy and engaging enough plot to keep my interest throughout its main disadvantage is that it seems like it was made-for-tv full screen and though there were several sex scenes there was absolutely no nudity boy did it come close strange too since netflix shows that it was rated very titillating and i wish alicia silverstone made more movies like netflix reviewer stated that it was part of a series but i have been unable to find out what series that is i'd like to find out though because this movie was that d in lv
i've seen the thin man series powell and loy are definitely great but there is something awfully sweet about powell and chemistry in this flick jean arthur shines when she looks at powell there is an unmistakable undercurrent buzzing between them this film may not have the wit of the thin man series but undeniably makes up for it in charm while i watched it i thought for sure powell was carrying on an off-screen affair with arthur my friends thought the same this is one film where i wish i could step back in time schmooze and lock lips with powell there seems to be no end to his lovable playful smirks character lawrence bradford is probably the closest thing to the perfect man okay this is sounding way too gushy but i can't help myself
we always watch american movies with their particular accents from each region west etc we have the same here all foreign people must to watch this movie and need to have a open mind to accept another culture besides american and european almost dominate the cinematographic movie tell us about a parallel world which it isn't figured even for those who live in a big city like são paulo all actors are improvising and they are very realistic the camera give us an idea of their confuse world the loneliness of each character and invite us to share their a real great movie and worst a rent even have it at home
expecting to see a cute little film from mainland china i was ill-prepared family dynamics community and the inevitability of change have rarely been explored so expertly on film every character is solid and i was completely drawn into the story the organization is much more complex than american audiences will be accustomed to yet there is no difficulty following the progression even while reading subtitles jiang wu as the retarded brother is a constant shining light leave your cynicism in your locker it will be there when you check out
i've just seen those who don't know what it is i suggest to download the entire feature and enjoy viewing kinda amateur made trailer featuring the same producer of the famous short batman dead end but this time besides the black knight there is also superman it would be wonderful if they made the entire i'm afraid that almost impossible especially just before the official batman there is no greater crime against peace than the refusal to fight for purifier'pinto
documentaries of this kind are often very opinionated this film seems to take all opinions out and let the viewer decide what to do with the information provided it is sad the conditions these poor people have to work in this film does a great job of showing the ugly side of sweat shops the film mardi gras made in china was a good way of showing the world how something as petty as beads for a celebration can effect the lives of so many people in another had to watch this film for an english class where we spent our time talking about sweat shops and how some people are trying to eliminate them and this film helped get the topic rolling it was a great very informative movie and i'd recommend anyone see it it kinda opens your eyes
this was a well written tale of the making of the batman sitcom and actually reunites our heroes on a great quest as well as offers their tv shows history unlike the and partridge family documentary movies we not only get a look into the past and present lives of adam and burt but also get to see them back in action filled with and catwomen and the batman is back ina well told tale that not only gives us a satisfactory closing to the batman series but fills the modern fan in on all the hollywood tales that about them that haven't been heard in
i really liked this movie i have seen several gene kelly flicks and this is one of his best i would actually put it above his more famous american in paris sometimes it seems the story gets lost in gene kelly movies to the wonderful dance and song numbers but not in this movie it is definitely worth renting

although the story is fictional it draws from the reality of not only the history of latin american countries but all the third world this is the true pure and raw recent history of these countries summarized concisely in this novel film the offbeat supranatural stuff lightens up the intensity of historical events presented in this movie after all the supranatural stuff is a part of the culture in the third world although is not critically acclaimed because of the supranatural stuff this is an excellent movie with a great story and great acting
this film is a stunning piece that will convince even the most skeptical viewer that gerard depardieu is one of the finest film actors of the last years his performance shocks entertains disgusts and charms you while leaving you breathless this film was shot in the very early days of his film career and is very raw but still is able to convey the mastery of depardieu a must-see for any depardieu fan and by far his best early work
it is a pleasure to see such creativity on tv again this show is poetic artistic and good fun the characters relate well and the writing is not bad think it will improve as they get their legs definitely worth a girls steal the show so far in this series chuck is adorable as is olive the two aunts are a delight i sincerely hope they write them into bigger parts as they are all the news that is fit to print go make yourself a big bowl of popcorn and enjoy something fun in an old fashioned way this is like dr seuss for adults
i have copies of both these movies the classic where robert blake is a mighty fine actor where most of the movie blake is more shown standing by a window in jail telling his childhood life where it makes since why he killed the clutter family doesn't show much in the classic of what really went on an doesn't tell us which one really done the killing but a great eye catcher really if you watch the movie in cold blood the classic makes a lot more sence
i agree with all the accolades i went through a box of tissues watching this film it had a gritty authenticity and rang true in every question i'm about to raise represents a current sensibility regarding the treatment of animals i had a very difficult time with the beginning slaughter of sheep and goats and the dying deer with its pulsing neck and pooling blood as its life drained away was is the age of no animals were hurt in the production of this move iphigenia was made in the late before the advent of computer simulation was it possible to fake these animal deaths or were these animals slaughtered for art
myself and sisters watched all series of tenko and agree this is by far one of the bbc better whole cast were very convincing in the parts they portrayed and although the series was somewhat slower it was compelling viewing and my evenings wont be the same without doubt we will be watching it again as it is a series which i would never get sick of viewing and full marks to the bbc for such a brilliant series and the rate in all departments and would recommend this series to anyone although some age limits must be considered because of some adult grateful to the bbc for releasing this series on dvd and video
this movie is excellent and i would recommend renting it for anyone whose local video store owns it or even better you could buy it because chances are you're going to watch this over and over i can remember watching this movie as a kid and it was great back then but after watching it again yesterday i've found it to be good blend of comedy not as great as mr one of my favorites and action this deserves and i'm hoping that they will make a sequel soon crossed if you do babysitting or have to look after young children for anything then i'd recommend renting this movie as it will keep them entertained for hours

this is one of the best of the series ranking up there with resident evil nemesis biohazard last escape the game has a very good storyline in which you play as claire redfield in the search for her redfield you probably know from the original resident evil it is as scary as the other resident evil and contains alot more rating out of stars based on comparison to other videogames
i have seen the freebird movie and think its great its laid back fun about time the british film industry came through with something entertaining its good how the guy who met them at the service station gets mentioned way into the film in the news agents nice touch the acting was convincing am a biker they reminded me of some good times i have had in the bike scene it was good to see the film director getting in on the acting well done jon at the end a new crop gets mentioned in ireland is this the foundation for a film hope so keep them coming great film well written realistic characters
after all these years of peter brilliant costly giving of his soul film after film at last hollywood tosses him an oscar dance showed up one night late and of course blew me out of my complainant niche in my alleged life how does he do again also is brilliant in this kind of play both psychological battleships loaded for to author director cast and camera crew no wonder the lost to these irish scot english honesty in the when i personally believed honesty was pure and absolutely vital to trust i have modified my edgy extremes and will settle for more human warm flaws within myself and allows humanity to have a reverse gear and allows us to fix our own bull headed egos and erotic mistakes
this movie was disaster at box office and the reason behind that is innocence of the movie sweetness of the story music was good story is very simple and old but presentation of such story is very good director tried his best abhay is excellent and impressive and he shines once again in his role he did his best in comedy or in emotional scene soha looks so sweet in the movie rest star cast was simply okay music and all songs are good himesh is impressive as an singer here don't miss this movie its a wonderful movie and a feel good one for us abhay best work till date i will give to ahista ahista
maybe i'm being too generous with the i just love this movie i've seen it so many times but every time i see it i fall in love with it all over again just a simple romantic comedy with nothing huge or monumentous that happens but i'm a big romantic and this movie romantic i love meg ryan and tim robbins and walter mathau is so funny the scientists make me laugh so definitely recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it such a clean good movie and those are so rare now my brother likes this movie too so not just a chick-flick i recommend it if you need to laugh or if you're just lonely and need to a romance if you yourself can't participate in one a good un
despite best efforts this is a rather enjoyable movie about following your dreams i was surprised that it didn't strike me as over-sentimental this movie played fair dennis quaid was very very good in the role which is saying something for a sports movie i can't recall how many sports movies have had little quirks that bother me here everybody looks the part this movie is surprisingly good and i predict that it will do surprising business as it is a g-rated movie that doesn't require the viewer to stop thinking ebert to the contrary this movie is a success
this film tells the story of a romance between albert einstien niece and a gas station attendant in order to get the two together einstien agrees to help tim robbins learn to act more intelligent this impresses catherine ryan unfortunately einstien goes too far and ed is considered to be a genius hilarity ensues not to be missed filmed in mercer county new jersey at princeton university lawrenceville prep school for princeton university as well as a beautiful vintage gas station in hopewell
this movie was great it was an excellent rendition of an ancient myth the animation was somewhat odd but nothing new from disney it was definitely better than expected for a disney movie with no background animation was magical it was a different level of work for the disney people some of the characters were a little boxy but it was more than made up for with the beauty and lushness of the scenery the music was largely instrumental but that was perfect for the movie this was definitely not a film that needed the characters to bust into out of
considering all the teen films like the breakfast club and pretty in pink that are lionized it is surprising that this one is so is no sex in it but sex is thought of including the idea that it may matter what others think about it the kids do not always get along with their parents but neither the parents or the kids are seen as always right or wrong and the parents are not seen as deals with hero-worship how one girl does a dangerous thing which could have lead to real dustier before realizing that she was movie is kind of ahead of its time one kid asks another kid what birth control she uses she says she is doing nothing to need birth control she replies oral sex
doctor feinstone is a has a beautiful wife and a huge house with a he discovers that his wife is making out with the pool attendant-he realises that behind everything is starts to torture his bernsen is brilliant as the deranged dentist-he is completely is surprisingly little gore but the scenes of dental torture are quite nasty and dentist is also worth checking out
i'm glad that users of this date who liked this movie are now coming forward i don't understand the people who didn't like this movie it seems like they were expecting a serious treatment c'mon how the hell can you take the premise of a killer snowman seriously the filmmakers knew this was a silly premise and they didn't try to deny it the straight-faced delivery of scenes actually makes it funny yes there are times where the low budget shows as that explosion scene but i think an expensive look would have taken away from the fun of the movie so if you like b-movies and the goofy premise appeals to you then you'll certainly like jack frost
i enjoyed the film and would suggest to anyone just out for a good time don't take the film all too seriously because remember disney and rated g good clean fun although some parts may be recognised by adults but children would never notice particularly the triangle between cruella le pelt and faithful valet alonso glenn close is fantastic and really has made cruella her own and is believably terrifying even when she is cured of her fur loving ways she can instill fear in the audience with her shrills that literally shake the theater even found myself jumping in my seat when she catches you by surprise with her bipolarity as the dog loving ella all in all i will go see it again in theaters i found myself enjoying it so much
who loves the sun works its way through some prickly subject matter with enough wit and grace to keep the story not only engaging but often hilarious been a while since i've found such a thoroughly touching thoroughly enjoyable film film is gorgeous drawing the eye with beautiful scenery and tranquil landscapes the peaceful imagery contrasts wonderfully with the tension between the very human very flawed and yet very likable characters due to the excellent cast all five of the major players are wonderfully interesting and dynamic recommend who loves the sun a really funny movie that takes a poignant look at the hurts that we can inflict on each other and the amazingly difficult but equally rewarding process of forgiveness
i grew up in royersford pa the town where market was i remember my whole family going out to watch the filming i remember a guy showing the blob to me and my brothers in a bucket i also would like to share that my mother was in the movie her hair style was the same as aneta and she was ill one evening and they saw my mom and asked her to sit in the car with steve mcqueen for some shots from behind they payed her and gave her a story to tell until she passed away this past august my mom was not a teenager and she was a few months from giving birth to my little sister
the shop around the corner is one of the great films from director ernst lubitsch in addition to the talents of james stewart and margaret sullavan filled with a terrific cast of top character actors such as frank morgan and felix bressart they're the type of character actors that hollywood sadly no longer employs in fact the film itself is the kind of movie that hollywood doesn't make anymore makers of you've got mail claim their film to be a remake but just nothing but a lot of inflated self praise anyway if you have an affection for romantic comedies of the you'll find the shop around the corner to be nothing short of wonderful just as good with repeat viewings enjoy
well vivah is quite a good but typical sooraj movie it shows different aspects of indian families wedding ceremonies etc the movie is more than good but not extremely big plus point of the movie is direction music and shahid and acting the last scene the movie starts with a common factor of indian a girl being disliked by her step-mother story is the movie is a bit common but it is good good enough to make the movie a point is common story of bollywood movie overall i would say it is two times must watch movie if you want to see typical indian family values and of-course love
the movie was excellent save for some of the scenes with esposito i enjoyed how it brought together every detective on the series and wrapped up some plotlines that were never resolved during the series to nbc it was great to see pembleton and bayliss together at their most human and most basic persons braugher and secor did a great job but as usual will get overlooked it hurt to see that this was the end of homicide memories tapes and reruns on courttv just aren't the same as watching it come on every friday but the movie did its job and did it very well presenting a great depiction of life after al retired and the family relationship that existed between the unit i enjoyed this a lot
second part episode of the hit danish tv-series is slightly inferior to the first one but has plenty of laughs and scares as well this time udo kier plays two parts as the monster baby and his demon-like father other standout parts this time are søren doctor krogshoj who must face the horrible revenge of dr helmer and once again patient mrs drusse tries to solve the mysteries miss marple-style ends on a cliffhanger and following the deaths of lead actors ernst hugo järegård helmer and kirsten rolffes drusse you wonder how ever going to be able making part iii but i hope von trier will give it a shot sadly morten rotne leffers the syndrome dishwasher died shortly after as well look for stellan skarsgård in a cameo
from the first scene you are given clues as to what may be going on here it becomes more and more obvious as the story rolls on the acting is excellent throughout and these actors touch your soul even though i knew what was going to happen i was extremely puzzled by the motive i'm still puzzled as to why ben did what he did we could see in his face second thoughts but the ultimate sacrifice seemed to go against his emotion and feelings it was a very interesting and touching story but it left me confused maybe that was the point of the film i did like the film and wil smith can wrack up another good film choice this guy knows how to entertain an audience
very funny it has a great cast who each give great performances especially sally field and kevin kline a well written screenplay by andrew bergman in vegas i don't like soap operas even though i never watch them but i do love this film because so crazy and off the wall that it beats the hell out of any stupid soap that they have on daytime television in my opinion the best film of
looking back over the past years my first exposure to the show all i can say is once you get it-it will stay with you forever i remember my initial reaction being annoyingly overacted produced unlikeable two years later i watched some episodes again and didn't find it nearly as annoying a year later i was able to catch the entire series from the beginning and quickly became engrossed in bittersweet tale of human fault and perspectives on happiness yes the show has a style that is not for everybody and i'm sure the dated production value would be hard to deal with now but i still think about the show at least once a month with a vague teary eyed longing for what seemed like simpler times i am a married all who think this is a show for females
a man readjusts to life alone after years of marriage he also has to solve the problem of the family milch cow tulip which refuses to allow itself to be milked until that is he visualizes his wife who was the one who used to milk is based on a real story told in family of her grandparents generation the film is a nostalgic look back at a disappearing way of life one where people still felt some sense of responsibility for each other set in the lush green victorian australian state not the era and director griffiths evidently has further ambitions in both areas and this multiple award-winning short is a fine beginning to her reel
this is one of jackies best films that is him without opera buddies sammo hung and yuen biao it has one of the best openings in any action film and it carrys on in that way with jackie showing some high quality stunts the only critisim is that in the middle it gets a bit slow but it shows up for a frantic last mins in the film and the end credits show what a crazy fool jackie chan is just to keep us film addicts happy
if you have not heard of this film from walt disney pictures do not worry about it it would be classed along the other films by disney that are meant for educational purposes like family was co-produced with kotex to teach pre-teen girls about menstruation supposably it only educates at a superficial level so it does not go into heavy detail for the animated reproductive system film does show the wonderful world of disney elements like the turning of the page and the use of animation to tell the film is impossible to find so if you can find the film best luck to you and enjoy
all i have to say is if you don't like it then there is something wrong with you plus jessica is just all kinds of hot the only reason you may not like it is because it is set in the future where seattle has gone to hell that and you my not like it cause the future they show could very well happen
this movie has everything a fantasy movie should have romance clever witticisms great acting and a fair dose of magic thoroughly enjoyed this movie and was drawn to its original plot on the neil gaiman novel which i am now looking to read and colorful of the most striking things to me actually was how self contained the story is unlike so many sci-fi fantasy movies out there right now which leave open-endings and such this was a pure fairy-tale satisfying in and of itself with no need for a fun feel-good fantasy
fairly funny jim carrey vehicle that has him as a news reporter who temporarily gets the power of god and wrecks havoc carrey is back in familiar ground here and looks to be having a good time and jennifer aniston as his put upon girlfriend is also charming and affecting the story is predictible to the extreme but the cast morgan freeman as god is great and makes the film worth catching grade b
a brilliant movie about family guilt sacrifice betrayal and love macy is such a great actor it was almost a shame to see him in the same scenes with campbell who looks the part of a neurotic sex object but doesn't have the chops to work with him on the level the script called for but such a good actor that he played down to her level to make the scenes work i highly applaud the casting of tracey ullman as the neglected wife who knew sutherland is also very good the way he moves makes his character look taller even younger in some scenes almost everyone knew what they were portrayal of the only situation in which his character is not able to be careful is nothing short of complete mastery
love this film also saw it when it was first shown germany in a small independent cinema in frankfurt it was really crowded and it was a very ambitious atmosphere to the erotic of the movie hit the spectators and the discussion with moritz boerner the producer and director was always underlined by that in his genre it was a very ambitious movie even especially when you think that it was an independent doesn't exist much copies of that film mortitz boerner came from the theatre and made two or three short movies more worked for tv as well before he became a sort of the people who wish to see that movie again you could find it on his homepage which isn't that easy to search for but its possible
i can't understand why many imdb users don't like this movie why they think sooooo bad etc not worse than anything else out there personally i think soldier is a great movie far better than most other films in the same why i liked soldier kurt russel connie nielsen jason scott lee the script webb peoples great visual effects and the directing even think that this is the best work i've seen from director paul anderson who has previously directed the entertaining mortal kombat and the not so entertaining event horizon
this movie is light funny and beautifully filmed the lightning is absolutely superb and the colours convincingly remind vermeer is sentimental comedy at its best way above us and french standards and arguably better than english ones too character is touching and interpretation is close to perfection isabelle blais is splendid sylvie moreau is better than in the catherine series stéphane gagnon is charming emmanuel bilodeau is great in that weird role of his and geneviève laroche is the perfect best could go on for hours before finding any negative comment on this movie so give it a chance and add your own review
as a rebuttle of sorts to the top films the british film institute worked out a documentary with martin i am a huge film fan and pride myself on having seen many many films but i am nowheres in comparrison with my idol in this fantastic long documentary scorsese walks the viewer through several stages of the american history on film this is divided in to several sections including the western the gangster film and the noir full of bouncy enthusiasm martin scorsese is a great tour guide as well as a fantastic professor
this film has scenes that come back to me at the strangest times that intense scene with mr muckerji telling mrs melandez that someone he spoke with witnesses the girl being pushed out the window by a woman who fits her description one that rolls around the way she keeps referring to him by name in a greek accent mr muckerji and then when boyer discovers her having just taken poison and gives her one last smack up the side of the head before she dies its a delight fools fools all my etc you get the have to buy this one i love dan acting he usually plays some plump foreign sultan or police chief and appeared in casablanca and many great pictures
first episode i saw of lost made me think i thought what is this some people who crashed and get chased by a giant monster but not like that far more than their is no monster at all and every episode that you see of lost well getting better every time a deserted island with an underground bunker and especially the connection between the people who crossed paths with each other before they crashed the real series rules and i can't wait to know really going on there i hope that they don't air the last episodes in the series deserves a out of
i have seen this movie when i was about years old which was years ago and i never forgot this movie i was deeply touched and moved by the brave little boy and the beautiful eagle and i just couldn't believe it when he turned into an eagle just when everyone in the theater thought he was going to sister was in the movie with me and i asked her recently if she remembered the movie we saw with the boy and the eagle and she said she remembered it like we saw it only yesterday so it isn't just movie is a must see will never forget it just like my sister and me
the actors play wonderfully especially kenneth branagh himself good that robin williams got the comedy role of osiric otherwise it could be a bit strange to see him in such a production it is really great that kenneth decided to use the fullest version of the text this happens definitely not too often thanks to that the viewers can see the whole not the chosen by the director parts also thank god that the film is in a classical form no to surrealistic fanfaberies although tytus andronicus was impressive nevertheless but still hamlet is a different story at least my point of view
the straight story is a truly beautiful movie about an elderly man named alvin straight who rides his lawnmower across the country to visit his estranged dying brother but just the basic movie is about so much more than that this was last role before he died and definitely one that he will be remembered for a stubborn old man not unlike a lot of the old men that you and i probably know straight story is a movie that everyone should watch at least once in their lives it will reach down and touch some part of you at least if you have a heart it will
pierce brosnan greg kinnear hope davis adam scott philip baker hall directed by richard well formulated story and film all together brosnan has never been better in a film role outside of his bond movies after after the sunset his newest role brings in the laughs and a great time professional hit-man so to speak julian noble on a job in mexico city winds up meeting the exact opposite of himself a high strung business man danny wright possibly one of his best roles also on business there the two on-screen duo produce a comically charged laugh riot and fail to not deliver the laughs davis in one of her best roles since american splendor gives another charming and witty performance one of the years most enjoyable and best films my final rating
i first saw this movie at a festival there were many good movies but few kept me thinking about it long after and an nightmare was definitely one of them tess is definitely a gifted filmmaker the shots were great casting was perfect dominic shined in his role that she perfectly crafted there wasn't a lot to know about his character but she wrote the story in such a way that we cared about him and i can't wait to see where she ends up showing a lot of talent and i hope she does a few more films with all the million dollar budgets trying to get a cheap thrill tess shows that all not needing as long as there is a good story and actors kudos to everyone involved with this film and thanks to tess and co for distributing it on dvd
i wasn't going to watch this show but i'm glad i did the critics of this just don't get it one of the funniest and most entertaining thing on at the present moment though when the interviews were done with common folks they probably seemed useless but put them in the mouth of animals and insects and a laugh riot i laughed so hard i had tears in my eyes the pig with the babies suckling and her mother is priceless the husband and wife birds talking about health problems and the male bird taking a crap after the wife said she was constipated completely broke me up creature comforts is the most imaginative show i've ever seen in awhile hopefully it will be back next summer when this run is over
this is a fascinating account of the hunt for the soviet first known serial killer i had tuned in just expecting a half-decent tv movie but found myself drawn by the compelling way the story was told as others have said there is much to admire here that is sadly lacking in many big screen of the credit must go to chris gerolmo whose intelligent screenplay and direction draw the viewer in until it is impossible not to feel emotionally involved the acting by the whole cast is also superb especially that of the two leads stephen rea and donald sutherland their convincing portrayals give their character arcs a great deal of credibility and the scene where they have their first committee meeting after perestroika is genuinely you prefer your crime films with a bit more depth and a little less sheen i strongly recommend you look out for citizen
although the recent re-telling of part of epic troy with brad pitt was entertaining once iphigenia with the incandescent irene pappas is breathtaking unfolding in a natural setting with greek actors speaking their own language lends such authenticity a chance encounter with this film on one of many movie channels kept me interested in spite of my concentration problems there is no glitter or bling in this movie just a fabulously rich story impeccably told by actors so real one feels they are eavesdropping on a real family in turmoil i think even homer if he really existed would be proud of this
i love this movie out of hands down it is that damn good i am not much of a fan of movies but i gotta tell you this one opened my eyes astounding color and fast energy i was fortunate to catch this at a screening during the zoinks film festival in boston and the story really enveloped me from the start it had a lot of adult themes and character and when it ended i wanted more i hope they make a sequel that would be fun my only problem with it is the performance of melissa connor as anya ugh she sucks i've seen a block of wood pull out a better performance i don't what the director was thinking when he cast her but if you ignore her you can't help but give this movie a big ten
this movie is awesome if you take it too seriously of course you will hate it however quantity of dudes and right ons brings laughs and faint memories of about years ago i like its ability to make me simply chuckle at obvious jokes and silliness and its ability to make me want to watch its precursor bill and excellent adventure if you are looking for a film full of multifaceted jokes and totally mature humor don't watch it however if you want a film that is humorous and silly yet intelligent and engaging you will enjoy it i actually wish more of this sort of picture showed up in theatres and hey keanu reeves acting the way everyone parodies him as get much better than that
i love the series many of the stereotypes portraying southerrners as hicks are very apparent but such people do exist all too frequently the portrayal of southern government rings all too true as well but the sympathetic characters reminds one of the many good things about the south as well some things never change and we see the good old boys every day there is a lucas buck in every southern town who has only to make a phone call to make things happen and the storybook po white trash are all too familiar aside from the supernatural elements everything else could very well happen in the modern south i somehow think trinity sc must have been in barnwell county
i saw this in detroit in what must have been its original run i literally rolled into the aisle of the theater it was that funny i haven't seen it since but would love to where do you get a copy anybody saying anything about it being dated or overdone are for my money just a bunch of poseurs each skit is either wickedly erotically or perversely hilarious each one there is not a weak one included the opening sequence for instance which parodies features gorilla go-go-dancers with pendulous breasts felinni would have filmed it had he the wicked wit if you come to this film with an open mind and a blithely sneering heart you'll pencil it right into your very best list
a lot of people are saying that al pacino over acted but i mean common obviously for a movie role like this a cuban drug lord you need a bit of over acting in this role with that cuban accent this movie overall was a really good movie i myself rated a i would highly recommend people to watch this movie
this was an adorable movie a real feel-good movie when you need one the story is light is no gone with the wind but sometimes one needs this kind of plot funny and warm characters fantastic acting and beautiful k nagra from the tv show er is wonderful in this role she is definitely a new shining star for hollywood all should keep an eye on her going to be big in the impressing was the soundtrack for this movie a nice mix of modern and indian tunes i was dancing throughout most of the recommended if a fun movie is what you need
i think this still is the best routine there are some others like bring the pain and men are pigs that are hilarious damon waynes last stand is also funny in a tearful way but this routine has no errors all the jokes are funny and the time limit of minutes is perfect just long enough to last years i just love how he allows the audience to be totally themselves and unrestricted i'm a fan of the classics and for a guy who watched a lot of of jim carrey growing up watching a more laid back comic is pretty cool not putting in a category with ellen and newhart but something you can watch if you're bloated thanks eddie god bless
the mere fact that i still think of the movie a decade later is what really speaks volumes about the film to me this substantiates grand canyon as a film that will touch you in one way or another i truly believe that before the movie crash there was grand canyon the major difference between the two films in my opinion is the timing of their release i'm not going to argue which one is better but i will contend to the idea that they share the same message i'd love to hear from those that have an opinion on this subject i will start a commentary which you can find at you may also find me there to post any other topics about movies that we may share because i have a true love for film
right then absolutely brilliant but you must be intelligent and quick to understand his humor he covers all sorts of topics such as the first moon landing transvestitism movies and herr doktor those of you are averse to swearing this isn't for you while some of us punctuate with commas and periods he uses the f-word also if you can't laugh at yourself never watch this you will feel the i've watched his other stuff and even saw him perform live and this is by far his best work he simply might go so far as to say he is glorious
yes the cameras were in the right place at the right time so interesting to see how a world leader chavez who supports the poor people in his country can be held in such low esteem in the us his worst sin in my opinion is caring about those who are at the bottom of the barrel what can be so bad about that i have always been fascinated by the us reaction to fidel castro at first castro was a good guy when he supplanted batista soon however castro started turning the corporations in cuba toward the needs of the poor instead of the fat cats we're a decent country but why does our media and government have such a problem with sharing with the poor if these guys are dictators then we could use more dictatorships especially where the poorest of the poor live in the world
we stumbled upon the documentary grey gardens last sunday and got sucked in without warning everyone who entered the room became transfixed on the television and the haunting images of edith and edie who seemed to be living out their lives in practically one room of a large filthy mansion on the beach eating ice cream and corn on the cob was cooked on the bedside the cat urinating on bed and her unbelievable words i thrive on it smell we had not seen the beginning and wondered what we were watching and how these aristocratic women managed to get in the position they were in spellbinding a must see
this is not only one of the greatest jackie chan films but also one of the greatest kung-fu movies of all come to expect crazy stunts and fast creative action in movies and this one set the benchmark for others to follow two hours of pure entertainment that impresses all the way well as the superb action we have a viable storyline and believable characters with chan taking what appears to be a more western approach to the writing mixing eastern resolution methods kicking funny serious entertaining and groundbreaking a must for any kung-fu fan whilst at the same time remaining accessible to the wider reaches of the film community
the sea is watching has been made from an original akira kurosawa script and it is indeed a lush and warm film watching it will be a pleasure kumai as director is certainly no equal to the old but everlasting master the mass scenes in the beginning of the film has some terrible acting but the overall mood and scenery is very enjoyable another thing that is missed here kurosawa always managed to let the characters be so much more then what they are actually showing and that was his magic on set while shooting and just maybe this script was not fully up to par we just miss the eye of the is one lovely and sweet film but it is no kurosawa to expect that might well be very silly
a country-boy aussie-rules player goes to the city the night before an all-important afl trial match where he is to be picked up by his cousin and then things go no-hoper cousin has become mixed up in a drug deal involving local loan-shark drug-dealer tiny looks like any gangster anywhere but is definitively australian needless to say mat becomes enmeshed in the chaos and it isn't long before thoughts of match are shunted to the back of his mind as the frantic events western australian professional shakespearean actor toby malone puts in a sterling performance as young naive country-boy mat and successfully plays a part well below his age best support comes from john batchelor as tiny and an entertaining role by david ngoombujarra as one of the cops following the events roll is fast-paced often funny and a very worthwhile use of an hour
i can't say whether the post-wwii british comedies produced at the ealing studios are an acquired taste or not but i am completely addicted and the man in the white suit is one of the best no need to go into the well-known plot about the threat posed to both the textile industry and the textile unions by an indestructible dirt-resistant fiber suffice it to say that the slings and arrows suffered by the naively idealistic sidney stratton in pursuing his polymer vision make for a comedic delight many of the well-known faces from the world of british character actors the nervous cecil parker the suavely devious michael gough and the bluntly ruthless ernest thesinger put in wonderful performances guinness as always and forever is superb and joan greenwood is delectable as daphne the way she enunciates the word daddy makes the entire movie worth
jane austen would definitely approve of this paltrow does an awesome job capturing the attitude of emma she is funny without being excessively silly yet elegant she puts on a very convincing british accent being british myself maybe i'm not the best judge but she fooled was also excellent in sliding sometimes forget american brilliant are jeremy northam and sophie thompson and phyllida law sister and mother as the bates women they nearly steal the ms law doesn't even have any recommended
i loved that this film recognizes the intelligence of the viewer allowing the layers to peel from the characters through their interactions with each other about the unspoken loss that has so affected each of them cinematography is a beautiful and is an inspired reflection of the vision of someone i believe is an extremely talented new filmmaker with the maturity and artistic insight to tell a story that others with much more experience have failed to accomplish i see a bright future for this who had the ability to focus on a goal and accomplish it with for this achievement
busy phillips put in one hell of a performance both comedic and dramatic erika christensen was good but busy stole the show it was a nice touch after the smokers a movie starring busy which wasnt all that great if busy doesnt get a nomination of any kind for this film it would be a disaster forget mona lisa smile see home room
the pros of this film are the astonishing fighting scenes absolutely incredible sword-moves and martial art show off a true john woo masterpiece the story tends to be a bit week though but it never overshadows the overwhelming display of acrobatic martial art action if you are into martial art movies you are going to love this one
this fantastic whodunit is an early prototype of what soon became a very popular film genre i was happy to see william powell handling a detective story with charisma and charm and without the silly attitude of his nick charles character the thin man series while the story is good on its own i think what really makes this movie fun to watch is michael curtiz fantastically imaginative direction from a visual point of view this is a richly textured movie with curtiz showing an incredible command of the medium from split screen images to weird camera angles and imaginative flashbacks curtiz demonstrates that he was one of the best hollywood directors highly recommended if you are fan of this type of movie
this film is as good as it is difficult to find the hero writer and director is simon a man with an agenda he creates a fake magazine just to have the authority to interview the swine of los the actors the models the who believe that their own defecation doesn't smell with clever dialog zucovic succeeds in doing this sure the budget for this film was probably what he paid for a used car but this film is so solid and so well written that it works very well any person who can reenact edward the scream in the reflection of a silver trashbin at a local coffee house should be nominated for some type of award give this film a chance and listen to what it says because they have been making the same car since called the car bravo zucovic bravo
one of the best films i have seen in the past five years the cast is universally spectacular in a tale of young love and bravado on the lower east side of new york city with the two leads being superstars in the making funny charming sad and inspiring this is a totally refreshing take on urban youth that puts larry often-nauseating shtick in the gutter where it belongs although i have to admit that bully was a cut above his normal fare raising victor vargas is one film you will kick yourself for missing so don't miss it
good story and excellent animation the influence of frazetta and bakshi are obvious and a good thing anyone that enjoys conan the barbarian or the game dungeons and dragons should enjoy it the battle between good and evil is clear cut even though it may appear that at times our hero is neutral most often in fantasy movies elves are usually portrayed as having white skin and blond hair and goblins and orcs have dark skin and hair anyone familiar with or even work know they are not racist anyone that enjoys fantasy movies should like this movie it is not for young children due to violence and sexual innuendo the casting was well done and the scenes and music are first rate i hope someone puts this gem on dvd soon i consider myself lucky to have a vhs copy in good condition
this movie is another on the list that i did not want to see i was talked into it and dragged into the theater but boy am i glad for that i thought it was going to be just another love story but it turns out to be sooo much more than that definatly an intellectual flick one of those movies you have to pay attention to
guys and dolls has to be one of my favorite musical movies ever it is a very fun movie to watch and nothing more it embodies what people have forgotten about musicals-musicals were made to entertain not to to preach nowadays we have rent and chicago which are great musicals and good movies but they fail to bring us solid entertainment with no strings attached the only thing that bothered me in the movie was marlon brando the guy can't sing it was very annoying to listen to him sing and talk when i couldn't understand him if it weren't for marlon i would have given this stars guys and dolls provides old-fashioned entertainment that we rarely get these days watch it to have a good time
a longtime fan of bette midler i must say her recorded live concerts are my favorites bette thrills us with her jokes and brings us to tears with her ballads a literal rainbow of emotion and talent bette shows us her best from her solid repertoire as well as new songs from the bette of roses album spanning generations of people she offers something for everyone the one and only divine diva proves here that she is the most intensely talented performer around
simple-minded but good-natured drive-in movie about a simple-minded but good-natured high school graduate who has dreams of owning the coolest custom van in the world to use as his ballroom our hero spends his entire savings to acquire the vehicle of his dreams joint sharing and love making quickly commence with girls bobby has picked up at the local pizza parlor but he finds out much responsibility danger and heartache come with being the owner of such a mechanical van is a guilty pleasure of mine it captures the laid back mid mood and has enough unintentional humor to put it into the so bad good category
terry gilliam gives a stunning movie which i thoroughly enjoyed bruce willis madeline stowe brad pitt and even the small appearance of christover plummer makes the movie absolutely brilliant this is the only terry gilliam film i've seen and twelve monkeys is definitely in my top i think this is one of the four best bruce willis movies and brad best brad pitt delivers a perfect performance possibly one of the ten best performance that i've ever seen he played his role very convincingly bruce willis role cole was also quite convincing both bruce willis and brad pitt acted extraordinarily well with the brilliant story to back the great performances and to back that up terry superb directing
just kidding about the weight loss thing well you might lose weight you never know anyway what can i say i love this film it has that same sense of youth and innocence found in films like stand by me and the goonies closet illustrates the beauty of simple things and how often we overlook them the film reminds us what like to see the world through eyes and all the magic mystery and horror they perceive closet presents a tale uniquely human in its compassion that anyone had a childhood can both relate to and fall in love with watch it with friends watch it with loved ones build a fort wine optional
the fact that the movie is predictable is not a problem this movie is like a beautiful painting to be enjoyed the museum scene is like a nice music video the apres sex scene is an all too familiar scene in all of our adult lives but the movie would not hold any interest for me without keith gordon keith gordon is maybe one of the most underrated actors of our time almost everything i know about acting came from studying mostly his eyes he had the most compelling face his character possesses the qualities i look in a guy sensitivity and dedication keith gordon is gorgeous btw i kinda wish he'd shave his beard now as his lips jawline and apple were his prettiest set next to his eyes
this movie contains personalities that so deliciously are playing their parts i love the final when nobody knows what are they gonna do about their life but completely great when you see and realize that the priest is right is jut for two so what are the other persons doing there the movie embrace you to a new life to experiences to be able of dream with the other person and reach those dreams also shows you the life itself hard like it is but gives you the option to choose what you want and what you really need hope this comment works for you the movie it did worked well for me i bought the movie by the way take care
for starters a very funny movie with a few crazy characters running around that are bound to make laugh out the two russian life has a classical disney storyline but one of the good things about the movie family values are praised and the main characters of the film undergo some evolution in order to stand up against the grasshoppers in the end and it also has a couple of great voice-overs by dave foley julia-louise dreyfus kevin spacey course but actually the most amazing thing about this movie is the animation just wonderful all the details great colors every ant looks different beautiful backgrounds and the guys and girls at pixar made it all look so realistic all in all a very nice piece of work this is the best animation by disney since aladdin
so rare to find a film that provides a plot that can't be figured out at every turn surprises throughout delighting couple of things i could not quite understand though is that here you have the lead female character who plays the good girl hard worker and yet in the end she ends up being an anti-social risk taker that was not enough to make me not like it though but it did give me other thing i could not get was the old man who was being hauled away by the police at the very end of the film i never did get who he was or what his issues were if anyone has any ideas i'd like to hear what they might film was exciting and fun throughout and always left me guessing very much worth seeing
this is the most recent addition to a new wave of educational documentaries like the corporation and fahrenheit its commentary is clear and unwavering as is the breathtaking cinematic style of this well crafted feature the film manages to impose a powerful sense of how unsteady our world is as we rush toward an environmentally unsustainable future at lightning speed while showing us the terrifying beauty in our pursuit of progress a remarkable accomplishment which must be seen by all who care about the world we leave to our children this is also the only film at varsity theaters boasting a stick-on tag which reads to arrange group viewings please contact a further testament to the popularity and importance of this bet an academy award nomination for best
the father of the alcoholic drummer keith moon was named arthur i found so many similarities between dudley moore and keith moon in this movie liza minelli who usually overacts did quite a good job in this one and was able to turn cheek on dudley moore in every turn yes i agree sir john stole absolutely every scene it was a very different movie enabling the viewer to have a glimpse into another life we often try to catch a rerun of this movie on satellite god rest dudley moore this was such an enjoyable movie much satire and thumbs down to the rich and the close friendship between moore and sir john is rather endearing
what i loved about the on-screen adaptation of the stone angel is that it stayed so true to the novel great film as an avid reader i find the worst thing about film adaptations is that the book somehow gets lost in translation you can tell the stone angel team was careful not to let this happen with this burstyn was an excellent casting choice for the role of hagar and she is definitely a movie superstar however i think the canadian actress horne chosen to play hagar in her younger years also did an incredible job that warrants great praise i haven't seen any of previous work but i will definitely seek it out after seeing her stone angel heard the canadian theatrical release of the stone angel is going to happen in spring or summer i can't wait to see it on the big screen again
my mom took me to see this movie when it came out around christmas of i loved it then and i love it now i know everyone makes fun of hair in this one but i think she looks and sounds great and i seem to remember a number of women who copied that permed look at the time also the bath tub scene between streisand and kristoferson is just so sexy the music is great as well this is the groovy babs at her best
this is a real eye candy a world made of floating islands and flying ancient cities huge monsters whose preferred method of attack is hurling cathedrals at their opponents who can resist that an ancient prophecy a bunch of underdog heroes and a cute princess in search of her hero sounds familiar yes we heard that song before but you will forget that while looking at the spectacular movie is fun to watch while it lasts but after leaving the cinema you'll be longing for a little bit more is behind the what drove the knight crazy who built all these fabulous monuments castles and cities and why are they falling apart and apart from that one bunch of farmers where are the people really this picture looks so intriguing but no lord of the rings
how tasty was my little frenchman tells a story that is alternately sad scary and life-affirming it ends with a brutal finale that you knew had to happen even though you were even utlimately this is the greatest strength it expertly plays with your emotions and expectations then drops a bomb on i saw this in a film theory class at usc back in the it is not easy to find but is definitely worth hunting for
a highly atmospheric cheapie showing great ingenuity in the use of props sets and effects lighting focus to create an eerie and moody texture the story is farfetched the acting is merely functional but it shows how imaginative effects can develop an entire visual narrative this movie is recommended for its mood and texture not for its story
the hip hop rendition of a mos def performance to the musical is an incredible piece of savage consciousness that slams the violence in your heart with each snap if anyone can tell me someplace this song live wire snap by mos def from the ground truth an undeniable duty to see as the americans who might not support the mission but embrace each soul caught inside this savage miscalculation of take on the haunting as so many of us can sit back and be wire snap by mos def where can it be to find it unable to serve
like talk radio the booth is actually kinda predictable radio because we know the truth of what happened going in the booth because face the genre and the basic set-up not necessarily a bad thing in this case it means in essence that the filmmakers don't punk out in the end the way they might've in say an american version of this story the booth moves inexorably toward its conclusion but is so beautifully crafted on every level that one can enjoy the ride the way one might a familiar cruise along a well-travelled stretch of scenic road it reminds me of harlan spooky short story flop sweat the claustrophobia is at times almost palpable worth a nice long look
really excellent movie one of the best i've seen touching and simple just like life sometimes you cry sometimes you laugh and just beautiful not too much of anything just as suppose to be really loved the idea of the movie noone is bad or good all or just people sometimes make mistakes mostly because of pressure everyone tries to stay strong and some succeed more than others and the most important thing is that you don't have reasons to get angry you can do it but eventually the anger goes away and then you to need to let love come back in although hard there lies the true actors and cast the movie really gets you into the feeling of the nice recommend to see it especially if you like to see italians life
i've noticed that a lot of people who post on the kerching board seem to hate this show which i actually find very surprising i think one of the best british kids shows there is a shame ending because very funny a bit cheesy sometimes and has great characters the main character is a little like del boy although quite a lot smarter with his best friends he tried to make a million pounds for his mum by starting an online business and adopting a pseudonym of rudeboy his friends are seymour likes to cook and danny is simple minded and the comic relief character throughout the show some characters have left and new ones have come in but always been entertaining and improving
hawk heaven for lovers of french cinema and by extension french screen at its worst an indulgence actors getting to bitch about other actors question the validity of acting as a profession at all etc whilst at its best a glorious of some of the finest actors currently working from a simple premise jean-pierre request for water being ignored in a restaurant blier spins off in all directions and allows the cream of french cinema to strut their stuff before the camera even throwing in nods to those no longer around gabin lino ventura including the father bernard one of the great stalwarts of french cinema from whom he fields a celestial phone call at the end of the film discursive and prolix yes guilty as charged but also something of a guilty pleasure
running man viciously lampoons the modern-day american media complex and hits its target dead-center it may be an easy target but they pull it off none the less rm effortless takes on pro-wrestling some pro wrestlers as the hunters network television the nielsen ratings the american government entertainment-oriented anyway crime punishment and a half-dozen other things along the way a far cry from the original stephen king novella and arnold is not the ben richards of the novella either but who cares basically a arnie flick with all the well-choreographed action sequences and one-liners such an undertaking requires
simply but imaginatively filmed studio-set performance short a perfect match of music and images that defines the very coolness of cool and the hipness of hip the precise visual and musical arrangements give the lie to its claim to be a record of a jam session what it is is a pop video every bit as stylised and knowing as that implies and all the better for it among the very best music films ever made and almost certainly the most cinematic these cats are solid gone daddy-o
what network was diagnosis murder on i thought it was cbs am i right or also back in those days the actual production was near about the van nuys airport i surely remember because i practically made nearly two episodes in those daze more i remember the early days i had found an article in digest giving this a clue to a terrific episode so just for suggesting it i was awarded awarded or not i sadly didn't develop it and was cut out of it all due to poor publicity of mine so as a justification i learned as i always have the hard way roll the just a side bar on mr van dyke he had a house in the brentwood area on chalon road and it was an incredible party house dick had a terrific sense of modernism when he built that house
i can remember this movie from when i was a small child i loved it then and i still do now i managed to get it on dvd for my birthday and was over joyed because i had found it so difficult to find it previously and it had only be rented when i was younger my favourite character is charlie because he learns to be a good dog the movie is filled with fun songs and music the animation is brilliant and the character voices are perfect this movie has always been a tearjerker for me but i think that if i hadn't seen the movie when i was small then i would not find it as brilliant and fascinating as i do although i still believe that i would still like it because i am really into animated movies
i'm totally surprised by some of the comments on this forum and many of the reviews i think tony scott made a good movie here yes it is highly stylized flashy and over the top but it is very entertaining i'm glad at least ebert and roeper agrees with me movie may not be for anyone but if you like over-the-top dark humor cool action and dialog you should see it previously seen man on fire crimson tide and enemy of the state all good movies but i like this one more like a roller-coaster ride with great soundtrack selections visual styles and in a time when all movies seem to be it is nice to see that someone isn't afraid of showing nudity gory violence and have explicit doesn't hurt that keira is super-hot and even shows nipples in this one either
maybe i loved this movie so much in part because i've been feeling down in the dumps and such a lovely little fairytale whatever the reason i thought it was pitch perfect great intelligent story beautiful effects excellent acting de niro who is awesome this movie made me happier than i've been for a is a very funny and clever movie the running joke of the history of prince savagery and the aftermath the way indulging in magic effects the witch and dozens of smart little touches all kept me enthralled much of what makes it so good an elaborate special-effects-laden movie with more story than most fairytale movies yet there is an incredible attention to small feel like just going ahead and watching it all over again
this deserves a out of an absolutely refreshing show with real characters and real stories this show needs to come back i've seen every episode and this is real show centers around a couple of new yorkers plays around with the concept of the six degrees of separation and cleverly intertwines their lives bridget moynahan and jay hernandez are stunning and so is the adorable caseman the scenery is amazing and wardrobes are need more shows like this that makes viewers feel like they are intelligent individuals not mindless it never comes back six degrees will be sorely missed
i for one have shamelessly enjoyed every episode of pushing daisies this season and hope that the writers strike won't brutally end the beginnings of a very good show ned is a pie maker who owns a restaurant in the middle of town and has a secret talent emmerson is a private investigator with his own unique quirks like his love of knitting charlotte is the once-dead-but-not-anymore childhood friend and sunny spot of life olive is the jealous but good-hearted waitress oh and add the dog jim dale brings all the characters together with his wonderful narration of the show chuck ned and emmerson along with olive and occasionally the dog solve multiple murder mysteries with the assistance of special gift of bringing dead people back to life the show is funny clean and romantic in a very cute and good-hearted way and i'd recommend it to anyone
one of the most frightening game experiences ever that will make you keep the lights on next to your bed great storyline with a romantic horrific and ironic plot fans of the original resident evil will be in for a surprise of a returning character not to mention that the voice-acting have drastically improved over the previous of the series don't miss out on the best of the series
the brilliance of this movie is that even a competent dentist is pretty scary one of primal fears this movie is the nightmarish image every kid has to go through in the waiting room corbin bernsen gives a surprisingly non-lackluster performance as a crazed dentist who i guess tries to kill people but he only works on their teeth so not really working out in a particularly gory scene we find so-so actor earl boen having his teeth completely destroyed with drills and whatnot which i guess is the absolute worst you can do when you're a killer dentist a typical brian yuzna situation not well written but gore the plot is shoddy and at times seems to be made up on the spot but hey a killer dentist movie we've all thought of it but they did it first
i really have to say this was always a favorite of mine when i went to see my grandma and it still is it is very very close to the book the way it is filmed and the players were just all excellent i have to recommend this movie to everyone who hasn't seen it almost everyone i talk to hates tv movies but this was really great i gave it
the folk who produced this masterful film have done fine service to a novel that stands as perhaps the best fiction work centering upon human guilt and human responsibility ever published nolte takes the role of howard w campbell jr and makes it his own remaining true to depiction of a man who has lost all and for weaknesses in this fine adaptation
saw this a couple times on the sundance channel several years ago and received a nice cinematic jolt to the system a semi-surreal yet hard edged take on modern media culture the lack of it focusing on some seriously wacked way-beyond-the-hollywood-fringe dwellers it had an amusing early performance from mark ruffalo and some memorable cinematography from the dp who did the polish brothers movies there was a savage umcompromising humor and a weirdly original feel to it that definitely set it apart this film had cult classic written all over it and i'm surprised not yet out on dvd soon
this did for crime what not another teen movie did for school i laughed all the way through as inept gangs warred with each other and among themselves an unsubtle comedy using overt jokes and gags that kept me rolling all the way i suppose the biggest gag in the entire film was that time never seemed to go forward leaving the characters trapped in the
the planning episodes were a bit dull but when they reached the desert it was quite fun to watch the reason why i call it the most realistic reality show is because much to my fell out of the race relatively early when his hands were sore i expected the usual stress and then a miracle fix but instead he actually quit the race the most anxious moment of the show must've been when max was stuck out in the desert with almost no water or food the ending was great and i was very happy to see at least one of the team make it overall not as great as the long way round but definitely an interesting watch as one gets a peek into the most challenging race in the world
deliriously romantic comedy with intertwining subplots that mesh beautifully and actors who bounce lines off each other with precise comic timing a feat that is beautiful to behold when spineless fiancé asks her to help him make peace with his estranged moody younger brother no one could dream the consequences which follow operatic symbolism catholic church confessions love bites and falling is timeless and smooth it takes about minutes for the rhythm to kick in an early sequence with the grandfather and his dogs at the cemetery a little rough and a following scene with cosmo and the elderly man at the gate that seems obtuse but the patchwork of the plot is interwoven with nimble skill and the wobbly tone and kooky spirit are both infectious from
an excellent movie about two cops loving the same woman one of the cop killed her but all the evidences seems to incriminate the other the unlucky montand doesnt know who is the other lover that could have killed her and périer doesnt know either that montand had an affair with the girl montand must absolutely find the what a great ending highly recommended
one of the finest films ever made why it only got a rating is a mystery this film is a window into the world of the black experience in america should be mandatory viewing for all white people and all children above age i recommend watching it with the long walk home as a companion piece if you think whoopi work is about homer and eddie or hollywood squares think again don't miss this movie which should have won the oscar read the book too
without doubt beat street is the best film about the breakin scene everything about it is spot clothes music and most importantly the dancing the storyline is hey whats there to tell a story about the whole point of the film is to show what kids of that moment in time were mattered to them it shows that teenagers in general are that mattered to these everyday kids was and friendship having watched the dvd recently i was plesantly surprised how well it had stood the test of time the clothes didn't look dated because puma is now having a massive music still sounds the dancing is still captivating to watch a film anyone years of age should see as part of their youth culture
i saw this movie once as a kid on the late-late show and fell in love with took years but i recently did find it on dvd it wasn't cheap either in a catalog that specialized in war movies we watched it last night for the first time the audio was good however it was grainy and had the trailers between reels even so it was better than i remembered it i was also impressed at how true it was to the catalog is around here someplace if you're sincere in finding it fire me a missive and i'll see if i can get you the info
in terms of visual beauty this movie is outstanding i had no idea that technicolor came out so early although i didn't like the ending the entire movie is fantastic and makes me wish that i was in north africa the cast is excellent and marlene dietrich is a big plus and of course she is so alluring and i just loved her in this flick basil rathbone is also perfect in this movie i couldn't get over the scenery and the sets the hotel the palm trees the desert all there the legionnaires also bring a beau geste feeling to the film they certainly don't make movies like these anymore don't fail to watch this classic
okay like many other such films spawned out of a snl skit but tim meadows does a fairly fantastic job of making a minute one-dimensional character into a moderately viable comedic movie character he drops amusingly consistently-threated one-liners with fair frequency billy dee williams is in it though his lando days are long gone and the entire thing is shot pretty well true not great art but if you went into world looking for the gone with the wind you did something wrong enjoyable for what it is
when i first went to watch the shining i was expecting a decent film from what i had heard about it and i liked a lot of stanley other work but when i started to watch it it was so much better than i thought it would times i seriously felt ridiculously uneasy and i couldn't take my eyes of the screen still something very disturbing about everything in the film now some people don't like version of the shining since it doesn't entirely follow stephen book but in my opinion both mini-series and the book are all nicholson gives an awesome you are looking for a good original movie that will keep you thinking even after the movies over then watch the shining
is it a good idea to use live animals for department store window and hare conditioned the sale that bugs is helping promote is over and the store manager is transferring him to a new department taxidermy naturally bugs objects and the fun nearly every department in the store wear sports shoes costumes nightgowns don't ask bugs comes out on top at every turn even referring to the manager as the great gildersneeze even when trapped in the confines of an elevator bugs makes the best of the jones is on top of his pictorial game as always as are blanc bugs natch and nelson manager who does sound like radio mainstay gildersleeves go ask your a sage word of advice when confronted by a fuzzy-looking woman wanting to try on bathroom slippers always check her stars for hare conditioner the best argument yet for animal labor laws
first i bough this movie on vhs than i just had to buy it on dvd it is on of my favorite movies of all time i have read the book but i really think the movie is much better i loved gwyneth paltrow as emma and jeremy northam as mr knightley was an excellent chose he was a
i'm a fan of going back to their records and liked this movie but at one point in the on cable television in san jose california it was aired with an alternate plot line that destroyed the entire point of the movie all references to marijuana were replaced with diamonds the bag that red drops to chong has diamonds in it instead of marijuana but the conversation still remains the same worth there is also a subplot in which clips of aliens on a ship were added observing and talking to each other about getting the diamonds at the end instead of space coke something else i'm not sure who created this version but it was horrible and obvious that they were attempting to make it friendly it would have been better if that network had not aired it at all
saw this movie at the vancouver film festival and thought it was deadly smart stylish and cast was rock solid great work by carrie anne moss dylan baker tim blake nelson billy connelly and up and comer alexia i found myself thinking about the movie for days after seeing dennis heaton robert chomiak and andrew currie layered in a lot of political subtext but didn't whack you over the head with world they created had depth and made sense there is a giddy carnivorous spirit to this is guaranteed to cure it
this movie is very entertaining and is never ever boring even running at nearly hours al pacino michelle phieffer and the rest of the cast are great in the film and are very believable the violence was a little extreme in the film but then it showed how vicious the drug trade was at the time of the film the ending is amazing and is probalby one of the coolest scenes ever great movie and you will probably really enjoy it
i have seen this film three times now and each time i see it it becomes more personal and more emotional to acting is amazing which is not hard to believe since it is daniel day lewis who is an amazing actor brenda fricker is the surprise wonder in it though she captures your heart as the mother of a physically disabled boy who is not able to walk or speak until he is in his late can't say enough good things about the movie but i will stop here i recommend it to anyone who enjoys movies that are based on actual events or just enjoy good dramas in general
yes flawed especially if you're into hollywood films that demand a lot of effects a purely entertaining or fantasy story or plot and you can't actually think for films are for the intelligent film-goer and insignificance is a perfect characterizations are brilliant the story is excellent but like all nic films it has you thinking on every level about aspects of reality that would never have dawned on you before his films always make you think and personally i like that in a don't expect to come away from watching this film and feeling all happy-happy because likely you'll be i think excellent
for columbo fans such as myself this is the episode of episodes that made a case for why columbo was so popular and just how good it really was ruth gordon has a field day ever playing the wittily intelligent crime novelist abigail mitchell seems abigail calls her nephew-in-law to sign some papers making him her heir she never got over her death and is convinced her dead husband frank did the dirty deed to tell more would be unthinkable mariette hartley has a sly role as personal assistant this episode of columbo is in a class by itself a truly well made television movie i recommend it most highly
if one would see a rené clair film with the kind of distracted semi-attention which is the rule in tv watching one might be better off doing something le million with all attention focused upon what takes place before eyes and ears will reveal a wealth of delightful details which keep this musical comedy going from the beginning to the end with its explosion of the danish newspaper berlingske tidende a journalist once wrote in my younger days i saw a film which made me feel like dancing all the way home from the cinema this film is on tv tonight see it
house is hands down the finest adaptation of a charles dickens novel ever put on screen alway one of my favorite was exteremely pleased with this television mini series the late great denholm elliot was perfectly cast as the noble john jardyce and diana rigg was sheer perfection as the doomed ladty dedlock the film captures the essence of dickens era and is extremely faithful to the making minor plot cuts that do not effect the story over all a and atmosphereic film
if there is one thing to recommend about this film is that it is intriguing the premise certainly draws the audience in because it is a mystery and throughout the film there are hints that there is something dark lurking about however there is not much tension and williams mild mannered portrayal doesn't do much to makes us relate to his obsession with the fares much better as the woman whose true nature and intentions are not very clear the production felt rushed and holes are apparent it certainly feels like a preview for a much more complete and better effort the book is probably thing is certain taupin must have written something truly good to have inspired at least one commendable effort
i saw this series when i was a kid and loved the detail it went into and never forgot it i finally purchased the dvd collection and its just how i remembered this is just how a doco should be unbiased and factual the film footage is unbelievable and the interviews are fantastic the only other series that i have found equal to this is die deutschen only wish hollywood would sit down and watch this series then they might make some great war band of brothers saving private ryan letters from iwo jima flags of our fathers and when trumpets fade are some i'd recommend
stephane rideau was already a star for his tour de force in wild reeds and he is one of biggest indie stars in this film he plays cedric a local boy who meets vacationing mathieu jamie elkaim in a stunning nuanced ethereal performance at the beach mathieu has a complex relationship with his ill mother demanding aunt and sister whom he has a competitive relationship soon the two are falling in fractured narrative which is comprised of lengthy flash-backs bits and pieces of the present and real-time forward-movement into the future is a little daunting director sebastien lifshitz doesn't signal which time-period we are in and the story line can be difficult to follow but stick it out the final minutes are so engrossing that you won't be able to take your eyes off the screen by turns heart-breaking and uplifting this film ranks with beautiful thing as must-see cinema
while in the barn of kent farm with shelby waiting for chloe clark is attacked and awakes in a mental institution in the middle of a session with dr hudson the psychologist tells him that for five years he has been delusional believing that he has come from krypton and had superpowers clark succeeds to escape and meets lana martha and lex that confirm the words of dr hudson only chloe believe on his words but she is also considered insane clark fights to find the truth about his own personality and is undoubtedly the most intriguing episode of smallville the writer was very luck and original denying the whole existence of the powerful boy from krypton the annoying hum gives the sensation of disturbance and the identity mysterious saver need to be clarified my vote is labirinto
running out of films to rent i picked up freebird i struggled through the first third of the movie wondering if the rest would be a waste to see fortunately it really warmed up and i loved the movie quite a bit the second half of the movie had me grinning and laughing the entire time thankfully although there were bits of cgi included they were not overdone or would have to say though the actors all have heavy european accents so be warned if you have trouble understanding those voices or their cultural really loved this movie and will have to order myself a copy for my own collection
very nicely done movie it does stay in your memory better billed as a romance than flying or war altho the flying parts are realistic and almost error free flying buffs like myself will enjoy this movie even if attracted by the airplanes unless they have no sensitivity or have never been in watching early crowe he is good and exudes charm his reading of high flight is boom
unfortunately for myself i stumbled onto this show late in lifetime i only caught a few episodes three before it was cancelled by abc i loved the characters and storyline but most of all the great actors i was a fan of sex and the city so i saw two characters i recognized moynahan was the character todd was smith jared as well as jay hernandez way rise to power and erika christensen i enjoy watching young actors get their due and felt like this show would propel their career further along i hope this at least gets put back out on dvd and maybe wb will pick it up for a second season sometime in the meantime i'm viewing it on website from the beginning
this movie is using cinematography fantastically the depth of the camera catches each character denzel washington and kevin kline put on awesome performances though washingtons accent does die in certain scenes how is this movie laying forgotten unable to rent nor hire in recent times it threatens to be lost forever a worrying idea attenborough at his best since ghandi this master piece stands for what it should in movies such as these no worrying about gaining audiences rather a cry for freedom in the south african critised for the biased nature the movie is faithful to the book by donald woods and faithful to the message intended to express to the world ta and peace
this raggedy ann and andy movie is so adorable we love watching ann and andy sing and dance along with the camel with the wrinkled knees this movie is what made the camel with the wrinkled knees so popular singing his song i'm nobodies i love you if you love raggedy ann and andy watch the movie and you will see why a movie the kids love and adults
i would have to say that this is the first quality romantic-comedy i have ever seen it had depth and although you knew from the beginning who was going to end up together there was still longing and anticipation the thought that maybe they won't get together it is an indie film after all this movie was well written directed and acted the dancing on the side of the road scene was magnificent
a beautiful and touching movie that deserves a wider viewing than it is likely to get semra turan plays aicha a second generation turkish immigrant who tries to break the mold neither entirely at home with her moderately conservative muslim family nor with her liberal danish friends martial arts experience becomes a fight to find herself and have the strength to allow herself to be who she wants to be in spite of both family and natasha arthy manages to balance introspection and narrative so that it has depth without becoming ponderous philosophical discourse and drawing on xian choreography skills pays off in spectacular fight sequences in the end however it is semra stunning debut performance that gives this movie spirit raw charisma and requisite martial arts skills are complimented by heart to make her personal drama worth your while
i liked this movie because it told a very interesting story about living in a totally different world at the south pole susan sarandon is such a good actor that she made an interesting strong character out of mediocre writing the true story displays a devastating situation for her character to overcome
first ever viewing july impressive screenplay and comedic acting and timing in this film now years old it has lost none of power neil simon displays excellent insight into human nature and relationships as well as how to create genuine comedy from unusual situations jack lemmon and walter matthau give great comedic performances neil simon was inspired by actual events in his own life to write the play this film is based of the best written and acted hollywood comedies of all only nominated for academy awards best adapted screenplay and best film editing hollywood rarely awards comedies no matter how well they are made
i'm a male not given to movies but this is really a well done special story i have no personal love for jane fonda as a person but she does one hell of a fine job while deniro is his usual superb self everything is so well done acting directing visuals settings photography casting if you can enjoy a story of real people and real love this is a winner
i watched the presentation of this on pbs in the when it originally aired in assuming the miniseries was available on dvd i purchased first editions of all three books last year since then i have been searching for the series on internet movie sites today i found this web site i will give up the too would like to buy this complete episodes miniseries after buying the dvds i would read each book then watch the episodes for that book that is what i did with john karla trilogy and larry texas ranger anyone have any suggestions for great books or book series that became very good tv miniseries or movie series that are now available on dvd
well let me go say this because i love history and i know that movie is most important piece in our history and it was beautifully executed movie and julia stiles became my favorite actress after seeing her in the and i own this movie in my video box with many movies and i suggest you to look for her new movies in the future and try to enjoy history
i have passed several times on watching this since i figured it was some dumb sappy dated romantic comedy well it is a romantic comedy and maybe a little dated however it is not overly sentimental touching as it does on themes of office politics adultery and loneliness you think you know exactly where things are headed but there is an element of unpredictability that keeps your interest and not everything turns out quite as you had expected but there is enough wit and charm to touch the most inveterate cynic if you meet someone who doesn't like this movie seriously consider how well you want to know them
being half-portuguese doesn't render me half-blind half-prejudiced when discussing portuguese films not that i get to do that very often anyway but this film was such a rush of adrenaline yes right it was mostly accurate as far as history but it pulled no punches on venturing beyond usual portuguese-film territory things like using real locations in the middle of traffic-congested lisbon and recruiting a real crowd to stand in for the real crowd of almost years ago and by god did they get it right ok to sum it up very emotional if you've lived through it but you'll spot minor improvements that could have been made as well as plot necessities that were if you're just watching it randomly you're in for a good historical romp only of the very recent history kind and a bit more thought-proving than usual even by european standards yes
contains spoiler with the possible exception of john wayne no other actor sat taller in the saddle in westerns than james stewart and this movie proves it this superb tale of revenge centered around a winchester only one weak spot i can think of the casting of will geer as a very unearp-like wyatt earp the casting of the villains was mcnally as surly dutch duryea as waco johnny dean and john at playing both good guys and bad guys as a slick gun runner the showdown between stewart and mcnally on the cliffs is great i'd stack this western against the whole crop of westerns made today they wouldn't stand a chance
cypher is a movie well worth seeing because not the run-of-the-mill sci-fi flick the artistic approach is painted with dark scenes and a kind of macro view of going on the close-up camera view is how the director keeps the plot illusive the sci-fi aspect of the movie is secondary to the plot of the movie the technology used in the movie isn't overly impressive however the director makes good use of the props character development is intentionally shallow the main character jeremy northam decides to immerse himself into the world of espionage up to the audience to figure out his enigmatic character and the enigma that keeps the audience interested right to the very end
i always thought this would be a long and boring talking-heads flick full of static interior takes dude i was wrong election is a highly fascinating and thoroughly captivating thriller-drama taking a deep and realistic view behind the origins of triads-rituals characters are constantly on the move and although as a viewer you kinda always remain an outsider still possible to feel the suspense coming from certain decisions and ambitions of the characters furthermore johnnie to succeeds in creating some truly opulent images due to meticulously composed lighting and atmospheric light-shadow contrasts although hardly any action the ending is still shocking in ruthless depicting of brutality cool movie that deserves more attention and i came to like the minimalistic acoustic guitar score quite a bit
long before brokeback mountain years before deathtrap was the first time i ever saw two men passionately kissing on screen and frankly i was shocked i understood it in terms of the plot and it didn't really upset my sensibilities much but it was the first time i ever saw it at least in a mainstream movie i thought it was a gutsy move for its time and took courage for them to try it especially christopher reeve in the midst of his time as pg-rated superman male bisexuality on screen may have hit its stride with brokeback but interesting to note this much-earlier incarnation
i saw this movie with my friend and we couldnt stop laughing i mean there was nothing scary about this movie it was funny all the lines freddy said were hilarious i think they shoudln't have even made a new nightmare and just gone to freddy vs jason although some parts were gross the head blowing up and any elm street film from sucked this was the best besides number i wouldnt recomend this movie if you want a good horror but if you have nothing else to do rent this and you'll laugh want to see the texas chainsaw massacre i think it would be scary dead the final nightmare overall grade
so wonderful so quirky so romantic so italian the film is so feather you float off into its refracted reality and you never want to return to the humdrum again a kitchen sink world of bakeries and hairdressers and plumbing but one that shimmers with a soft luminescence should the credit go to the screenplay or the direction take your pick they're both faultless let me get back to that new york city that lies just beyond the looking glass
nobody said movies had to be realistic did they i really liked this movie because i remember when i first saw it in junior high for all the kids who remember the pmrc and albums before there were warning stickers a cool story for all those kids who were part of the mid to late headbanger crowd
i found this episode to be one of funniest i've seen in a long time the south park creators have done the best spoof of a romero film i have ever have truly touched on underlying social commentary that he has made with each one of his films i would love to know what george opinion was on this episode i'm sure it was purely positive keeping his true vision for his zombie epics fully intact most spoofs deal with the pure gore without making the viewer think as romero tries to do with his films i think that if a zombie outbreak did happen we may actually worry about our property values before our lives as shown in this episode
thomas capano was not anne boss tom carper the governor was that is the reason the feds became involved he called clinton and asked him to get the feds involved in the case i lived outside of philadelphia at the time so the case was front page news every day i also read ann book and saw the city confidential segment on tom capano was a an uber-controller and a monster he claimed to love ann marie but all he wanted was someone that he could control when she wouldn't let him do that anymore he killed her the ultimate form of control i think a waste of money that he is still alive
this was the first movie i ever saw ashley judd in and the first film of victor nunez that i ever say and boy am i glad i did its quiet tone its relaxed pace its realistic depiction of a young woman just starting out in life its fine depiction of the struggles she has to go through to make her mark in life the decisions she makes based on real things the people she meets there is nothing wrong with this movie it is as close to movie magic as i have ever seen outside of the star wars movies and given what those films are like that means this film deserves a high rating indeed ashley judds acting mr nunez'writing and its great simple worthwhile story make this a fine coming-of-age story and a wonderful movie
writing something genuine and true is challenging knowing how to shoot it and putting it together without making it trivial is even better ishai movie is one of those where you can recognize life in all its simplicity and beauty i have been touched by the big bad swim and from now on i will promote it as far as i can it is just a shame that i can't have something to show to my friends know such as a dvd because talking is giving something to see is better everyone can't go to festivals to discover pearls like that and this really worth to be put out there a big thank you to the staff of this master piece and i am waiting for it to be distributed
paris is the place to be to enjoy beautiful art and music and to fall madly in love as is the case in this film boy meets girl they fall in love but something stands in their way of eternal happiness the classic wonderful music of george gerschwin complements the great dancing by gene kelly and leslie caron an american in paris is a humorous light-hearted loving film well worth
jess is very smart and wants nothing more than to play football when she joins a local team she has to lie to her parents again and again as they would never approve of her chasing her dream they want her to settle down with a nice indian boy and learn how to it like beckham is a very funny feel good movie that doesn't need to be deep and complex just fine as it is the cast are all very good and they play their roles very well the story is simple and predictable but it works perfectly and the script is very realistic and very great family movie
this series adds new information and background to the book and includes personal appearances by the author and by archaeologists and other anthropologists it brings the book to life and makes even more sense of the subsequent opus himself comes off as personable and caring not just a disinterested or disengaged academic this series makes it clear that his book was not just a response to a need to publish or perish as the saying goes about academe but a deeply considered answer to a question from someone he respects why you white people got so much cargo and we have so little because he respected the intelligence of the questioner and his community diamond looked for an answer that didn't insult that intelligence or that community i like to think of his answer in a very simple way in the same spirit as south blame canada blame wheat
i love this film it is well written and acted and has good cinematography the story blends action humor mysticism and tenderness with great sets and beautiful location shots see it buy it show it to your acting is good and murphy especially does a fine job portraying the hero i enjoyed all the characters and found them to be interesting and well developed with dynamic cared what happened to these people and while the outcome was pretty predictable good guys win the hero gets the astonishingly attractive girl and the holy child saves doesn't see that coming it still made me happy when everything worked out well in the end thank god this dignity was never ruined with a crappy sequel grab some popcorn cuddle up on the couch and watch this fun happy and entertaining film
i was pleased to see that she had black hair i've been a fan for about years now and have been disgusted at the two earlier attempts to film the was pleased that the screenwriters updated the period to include a computer it didn't spoil it at all in fact i watched the film twice in one day a sure sign that it was up to standard this is what i do with books that i like as thought all the characters were well depicted and represented the early days of modesty blaise extremely well as evinced in both book and comic strip i would also have to disagree with a comment made by an earlier reviewer about baddies having to be ugly has he actually read the thought this was a very good film and look forward to sequels with anticipation
cross-eyed is a very original and funny movie i think adam jones brings a refreshing new set of eyes to the comedy genre and really reinvents it in a good way this film is smart concise and consistently entertaining and funny as a jones exhibits complete control over his characters who are both absurd and lovable the story is definitely something you haven't seen before which is good unique and fun and manages to work in visually fantastic elements as well as the long lost slapstick genre together to form a hearty very promising first film
this is one of the best bollywood movies i have seen up until now family and friends feel the same way about it this movie is really romantic and dramatic at the same time in my opinion we need more films or movies like this to keep the south asian culture alive shahid kapoor and amrita rao acted extremely well in this also their couple attracts a lot of people to the movies this is a must see movie a family and romantic movie this movie is also from the makers of hum saath saath hain and hum apke hain kon this movie is their best right now the setting of the movie was beautiful which also is a huge attraction this movie is must see recommended to everyone
okay so i have come a long way from houston by now but whenever i see this movie i am taken back to a little dream to one day ride the bull at burned down before i was of drinking you grew up in in east texas then you know this movie is an accurate depiction of contemporary life at that time if you didn't then trust me and watch the movie either you will join the many who love it at the same time strangely repulsed or at the very least you can make fun of the red-necks is plenty material for poking fun this movie doesn't try to be was that in the or hide the white trash element and it is honest to the time and be a for me
a delightful little thriller opens with trevor howard in his jag convertible and ends on a dockside in liverpool all thrills and spills as the ex-spy has to restart his career just as getting some serious r r cataloguing butterflies british is howard and jean simmons frolic from london to newcastle-upon-tyne to liverpool ullswater just been thrown out of or something and she you guessed it is on the run wrongly accused of murder seedy docks rolling lake district hills sheep country pubs coppers getting lost waterfalls a bunch of amateur cyclists rooftop chases and lots of chinamen ask and all very hitchcocky and a smashing example of british noir
if you as i have a very close and long relationship with the world of yourself a favor and watch this beautiful documentary about hergé and his life creating tintin i'ts so brilliant and a very cool production the whole background story about hergé and the people and also very much the many different situations he was influenced by for good and worse is amazing there is a very fine and obvious connection between the comic books and just this i will for sure be in my basement digging up the tintin albums again also the movie itself are very well told and has a great ambient sound to it i really do hope people will find this as intriguing as i did
going for something far away from the deliberately gross stuff that he usually makes john waters birthday john made this parody of the world edward furlong plays the title character a working-class teenager in baltimore who loves to photograph things when a new york agent taylor discovers his work she offers him his big break which he accepts but once he hits it big he has to reconsider pecker looks at how he loses his friends and his normal life once he becomes a celebrity the sort of thing that we might expect sure but with waters directing always a few things to shock us know them when you see them i certainly recommend it also starring christina ricci mink stole and patty hearst
i loved this movie the characters were people that you could feel for the young man back from the service still in love with the girl he left behind tom drake is always perfect in the romantic lead as well as donna reed as the love of his life the looks he gives her as if he has been starved for the sight of her as well as her hesitation and confusion as too her feelings for him were played very well the rest of the quirky characters at the store were perfect as they tried to bring them together the most touching scene however was the young couple at his great house i laughed in parts cried in some and thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie in fact i've re-watched it about times a definite must see for total romantics
i gave this movie a because it needed to be rewarded for its scary elements and actors and my god the enging the thing is i don't want to tell anyone anything about the acting or story because it will ruin the movie but i will recommend that you go straight to your nearest moviestore right now and rent it forget popcorn
all the folks who sit here and say that this weak link is the ramones would probably say that amadeus was ok if not for that irritating harpsichordist rock and roll high school was centered around the ramones how anyone can watch this and not get a kick out of joey ramone eating bean sprouts backstage in an attempt to keep him in performing condition is obviously a wet blanket square daddy-o ms trogar exploding white mice the hall classics nevermind the riff randell you don't like the ramones then you don't know rock and roll and you don't deserve to watch a movie called rock and roll high school
tea leoni plays nora wilde a serious photographer who is going through a bad divorce she wants her freedom but it comes at a cost she wants to legitimate photography but is hired to work for the tabloids as a paparazzi her boss is played by the wonderful and divine holland taylor the show was well-written most of the time nora was beginning to develop into quite a memorable character but the network just didn't support comedy and they still don't even when they brought in george wendt from cheers they made unnecessary changes in casting and characters the show was fine in the beginning and the audience was getting used to it but then the network botches it up like a bad plastic surgery
personally this is one of my favorites of all time no i'm not i'm i own an old original vhs of this that i bought from a rental store i've watched it countless an amusing movie for kids an intriguing movie for adults i once saw this movie whiile i was not sober my eyes were opened to things i had never noticed before i saw morals being strongly encouraged both overtly and somewhat subliminally i wish i could remember all the things i noticed in particular but been a very long time since then rest assured there are tons of things that are alluded to throughout the movie if you get the chance to view it not sober do so you won't be disappointed as a matter of fact you will probably feel rather happy and and wonderful
this movie truly captures the feeling of what the freedom of your own integrity is the most delightful light-hearted way not a serious but hilarious story mirrors life we don't always get what we want right away but we find out we get what we need to to understand why we didn't get what we results in us getting more than we thought we would get you will get this once you see the movie this movie is truly about finding love and knowing one has found it and that it totally changed is one of my all time easy to find but worth the guarantee you will watch it more than once
i just saw this movie today with my children and daughter at the annual roger ebert overlooked film festival after the film the children in the audience were allowed to ask questions to the director tian-ming wu he a translator told several stories about his life and the making of the tangents aside both of my children really enjoyed this movie of course i had to paraphrase many of the subtitles for my daughter but much of the film is visually won't give anything away but the bottom line is that this film is so much better than of the hollywood crap films out there is a king of masks who do masks at once the actor in the movie trained and learned to do up to masks at a time they would cut and change to new masks
this is of of great early comedy films this isn't a parody of enter the dragon the main character is obsessed with bruce lee and emulates him freakishly well for a man of his size nominal story about how his fighting keeps causing his loved ones trouble then fighting oh the fighting good fast-paced scenes with high impact white guy who plays a boxer looks like he really gets hurt by one of funniest bit of this movie was purely unintentional there is a jim kelly looking guy of three experts hired to take out sammo but he was a chinese guy in blackface with an afro-wig come on didn't they have any real black people in hong kong in well i guess i've seen enough white fake-as-hell chinese people in old american movies is one is for any sammo or bruce lee fan
this is a great ending to the show the fact that adm janeway was able to do a double switch on the borg was great the fact that she allowed herself to be infected thus infecting the queen with a poison that in essence ended the borg was great the way they ended it also left some not a lot for a reunion movie however they did bring them home and the way they did it was fantastic it was sad to say good bye to a part of my family ending it with tom and b'lanna having their baby just as they enter the alpha quad was a great way to show a new beginning it would be nice to have a reunion movie of some type just to see where their characters would be today
absolutely stunning warmth for the head and the heart the kind of movie western movie makers are too rushed too frenetic to even attempt my kids watched it and they loved it too what real to show you how cultural differences japanese setting is less important than the human similarities go see it whether you like dancing or not
having seen most of ringo films i can say that this is his best film to date and the most unusual a ancient china period piece cranked full of kick-ass martial arts where the location of an underground lair full of traps and dungeons plays as big a part as any of the characters the action is fantastic the story is tense and entertaining and the set design is truely memorable sadly burning paradise has not been made available on dvd and vhs is next-to-impossible to get your mitts on even if you near the second biggest china-town in north america i do if you can find it don't pass it up
this film is moving without being sentimental meaningful without being pretentious it tells a simple story of a family in danger of falling apart as the encroachments of technology and an advancing society make the family-run business increasingly acting is wonderful though none of us in the west are likely to have heard of these actors we should have long ago they play their characters with honesty and reverence these are flawed characters each with major weaknesses but with such utter humanity and kindness that impossible not to become engaged in the need more films like this we need more western filmmakers creating films such as this
the movie is a bit thin after reading the book but still one of the greatest movies ever made sheryl lee is beautiful and nick nolte is really vonneguty he makes great job expressing the feelings from the book to the film not many films engage the feeling of the book as well as mother night does
despite the lack of logic present in the storyline kill shot is a highly enjoyable film through a moving performance kasper van dien brilliantly portrays the emotional rift between a hard working wealthy father and his misguided son each member of the supporting cast pitches in with a solid performance highlighted by the vivid acting of a young asian man whose name i cannot recall a shockingly tragic ending may unnerve some younger viewers but as a whole kill shot truly delivers a death blow
excellent movie a realistic picture of contemporary finland touching and profound one of the best finnish films ever made captures marvelously the everyday life in a central finland small town desires and weaknesses joys and sorrows the bright early fall sunshine creates a cool atmosphere to this lucid examination of people in a welfare society lampela is indeed one of the most promising finnish filmmakers he shows that it is possible to make gripping movies without machine guns and bloodshed his next film eila is also worth seeing although the story of cleaning women fighting for their jobs is not quite as universally appealing as the destinies in joki
i've always enjoyed kenneth versions of the shakespeare classics as he always does a very good job but in this movie the one who lifts the whole movie is none other than the-always-great-actor laurence fishburne surely he has made some poor choices in films even though a wonderful actor but in this one we're truly given the real othello the passion the intensity of jealousy as it grows stronger alongside with well portrayed paranoia and furthermore we're finally given a black don't think they could have chosen a better othello who else could have given him that blend of and not to forget those fiery eyes branagh is good as always but not at his peak iréne desdemona is fairly good but a bit bleak whilst laurence fishburne truly lifts it and makes it a very interesting and enjoyable movie do watch it
this is the epitome of fairytale the villains are completely wicked and the heroes are refreshingly pure danes pfieffer are wonderful as well as the new actor who plays the role of tristan outstanding performances delightful magic funny and dramatic and a perfect fairytale ending make this film absolutely fabulous i'm not so sure all content is appropriate for younger children but for an older audience there are plenty of hilarious subtleties the previews do not do this movie justice my fiancé and i were quite skeptical but were so thrilled we had taken a chance on this movie that i can only hope to assure anyone on the fence about this movie to give it a try
the biggest reason i had to see this movie was that it stars susan swift an outstanding and all-too-underappreciated actress time travel movies usually don't interest me and neither do movies about witchcraft but this movie was fascinating and creepy it didn't rely on outrageous special effects and it didn't focus so heavily on the time travel that the viewer gets lost and confused this was a really creative movie kept simple and focused with great acting by all
of the three remakes of this plot i like them all i have all three on vhs and in addition have a copy of this one on dvd there is just enough variation in the scripts to make all three entertaining and re-watchable in addition has any other film been remade three times with such all star casts in each of course the main stars in this one are great but the supporting actors are also superb i particularly like william tracy as pepi he was such a scene stealer that i have searched to find other movies he is in he appeared in many but most are not available as the other comments i also say buy this one
this is by far my most favourite movie in the world i enjoyed it when i was and i still enjoy it at its an absolute masterpiece no video collection is complete without it i enjoy every second of it and not only does the film have some great special affects but its sends a great message to the youngsters of the audience which may sound sheesy but in actual fact the movie is done very cooly in actual fact although michael jackson has been in afew movies now people still dont see him as an actor in reality the most talented actor i know so talented incredible moonwalker is a must see
although super mario isn't like the rest of the games in the series it is still a classic and is every bit as good as the old games games with this much replay value are few and far between plus this game has so much variety there are levels each with several different tasks you can do and many other hidden tasks the game isn't very challenging but its lack of challenge doesn't take away from the game at all once you beat it you'll want to erase your game and start again and its just as much fun the second time or third time or two hundredth time a must own for any nintendo owner and is a reason in itself to own a nintendo
i am surprised than many viewers hold more respect for the sequel to this brilliant movie i have seen all the guinea pigs and this one is easily the though ive seen the making of i still have doubts when watching those of pure torture its that out of because this movie achieved perfectly what it set out to do be the best fake snuff film ever made
star trek hidden frontier is a long-running internet only fan film done completely for the love of the series and a must watch for fans of trek the production quality is extremely high for a fan film although sometimes you can tell that they're green-screenin it this doesn't take away from the overall experience however the cgi ships are fantastic as well as the space battle scenes on the negative side i could tell in the earlier episodes even occasionally in the newer ones that some of the are not quite comfortable in their roles but once again this doesn't take away from the overall experience of new interpretations of star trek the cast and crew have truly come up with something special here and as a would highly recommend this series to fans of the next generation and deep space
i love ashley judd and think all of her movies are great paradise is one of her best it is a very understated movie that you really have to watch close to appreciate it a story of a woman trying to make it on her own and refusing to give in to temptations that would make her life easy some of her movies such as kiss the girls and time to kill probably did better at the box office and video rentals they were very good but take the time to really look at ruby and i think you will agree it is one of
i am very sorry that this charming and whimsical film i first saw soon after it was first released in the early fifties has had such a poor reception more recently in my opinion it has been greatly underrated but perhaps it appeals more to the european sense of humour than to example the american maybe we in europe can understand and appreciate its subtleties and situations more since we are closer to some of them in real life particular mention should be made of the limited but good music especially the catchy and memorable song a fine fine night which was issued separately on an hmv record inch plum label i think in the fifties i would urge anyone interested to give it a try if you get the chance you may have a pleasant surprise
probably the finest fantasy film ever made sumptuous colour spectacular sets incredible spot-on miklos rosza musical score that is perfect for each scene and mood acting is superb as well in what could have been stiff and pretentious in lesser hands but here the poetic dialog is deftly sensitively spoken humour is subtle and delightful as spielberg and lucas were enthralled by this one along with the four feathers one of the two finest motion pictures released by alexander korda and london one of the finest motion pictures ever true compelling classic
a very nice movie and i would definitely recommend it to everyone but there are minus points the level of the stories has a large spectrum some of the scenes are very great and some are just boring a lot of stories are not self-contained you compare to coffee and cigarettes where each story has a point a message a punchline or however you wanna call it but well most stories are really good some are great and overall one of the best movies this year for that i have to fill lines at minimum i haven't got more to say and i don't want to start analyzing the single i think it
the garden of allah was one of the first feature length technicolor films to correct a previous poster the first technicolor feature exclusivity deal was becky sharp which was a costume drama that used the color for garish color garden of allah looks as if it could have been shot years later as the cinematography uses not only the color but also the use of shadows it must have been amazing for an audiences at the time to see a color feature after seeing basically only black and white films for their whole life unfortunately the film does not stand up to the cinematography that being said the film is worth seeing just as a visual treat
back in eric monte made the classic show good times jj has always been my favorite and i love watching the reruns on land jimmie walker always seemed to be the star and not esther rolle john amos most of the time felt a little jealous of jimmie popularity winning millions of fans time to sit and watch good times the show would have been dead if jj would't have been there to save it with his always kool aid attitude drinking kool aid was like his favorite thing on the show i was when it came out and when it ended instead of it should have went longer like in the when i was just growing up
i read some previous comments stating that this movie loses steam towards the end of the movie and also that it has a similar ending to cape fear i completely disagree i'm going to give a simple review for the normal moviegoers out there i thought the casting was perfect i thought this was one of ed best performances what an evil psychopath i have a lot of respect for his acting after viewing his performance in this movie i was riveted throughout this movie if you like mystery thrillers then this definitely a movie you want to see i also noticed a young scarlett johannson in this movie this movie is filled with top stars and i highly recommend it
the third and last part of the bourne trilogy is lacking a bit in the story department but covers it with extensive action scenes twi in particular take up quite some of the running time and make this movie director and star themselves agreed that it was difficult to find a story for the last part because the end of the second movie was quite advanced story-wise how they got around that the action scenes for once but they did another thing too which i can't reveal because that would be a spoiler but if you watch the movie than you'll notice it funnily enough i read that this adaptation of the bourne books is the least accurate of all three films if that means anything to you o
full house is a wonderful sitcom that is about a dad danny tanner whose wife had just died in a car crash so danny asks his brother in law jesse katsopolis and best friend joey gladstone to help raise his three girls donna jo dj tanner stephanie tanner and michelle tanner this is my favorite show ever and i can watch it all day long and something on full house is always making me laugh and there are sad parts also there is never a dull moment in full house the main characters are played by bob tanner john katsopolis dave gladstone candace tanner jodie tanner and mary-kate ashley tanner
this very strange movie is unlike anything made in the west at the time with its tumultuous emotions and net of visions dreams and startling images its effect is both beautiful and unsettling the actors are choreographed more like dance than acting it contains the only dream sequence i know of that actually resembles a real nightmare dali fans
this is one of the best films we watched in my high school spanish class if you are a fan of the opera this film will strongly entertain you of course the dancing is wonderful watching these amazing dancers moving to the music of bizet is well worth checking out
oh yeah jenna jameson did it again yeah baby this movie rocks it was one of the movies i saw of her and i have to say i feel in love with her she was great in this performance was outstanding and what i liked the most was the scenery and the wardrobe it was amazing you can tell that they put a lot into the movie the girls cloth were hope this comment helps and u can buy the movie the storyline is awesome is very unique and i'm sure u are going to like it jenna amazed us once more and no wonder the movie won so many awards her make-up and wardrobe is very very sexy and the girls on girls scene is amazing specially the one where she looks like an angel a must see and i hope u share my interests
i love this show i watch all the reruns every day even though i have seen all of them like time s about two sisters holly bynes and val garth who live in new york holly goes to live with val when their dad is transferred to japan val has the perfect life she has a boyfriend and a perfect apartment of the upper east show basically shows all the problems vall and holly go through the main problem is guys but also is about being responsible and other life is and is a total free spirit while val is the complete opposite she is the organized has to have a plan to do anything kind of other characters are henry vince gary lauren and tina
i used to watch this show when i was a little girl when i think about it i only remember it vaguely if you ask me it was a good show two things i remember vaguely are the opening sequence and theme song in addition to that everyone was ideally cast also the writing was very strong the performances were top-grade too i hope some network brings it back so i can see every episode before i wrap this up i'd like to say that i'll always remember this show in my memory forever even though i don't think i've seen every episode now in conclusion if some network ever brings it back i hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good
karen goes into a japanese house as a substitute nurse to emma a strange woman who sleeps at day and wakes at night karen goes upstairs after hearing noises when she encounters a frightening ghost she will learn the is very scary the scenes are shocking and frightening the characters are good the settings are creepy i love the whole plot the ending was shocking i paused at a scene where the little boy meowed so loudly to the man finding his sister upstairs and i was shocked this is the scariest movie i have watched i did not see the japanese version i recommend this to horror fans and stars
if you a purist don't waste your time otherwise hold onto your hat and enjoy the adventure i loved the stewart kerr version i've seen it dozens of times but this film is every bit as good only different i won't detail the differences because it would spoil the film also it is a pleasure to see alison doody again a huge indiana jones fan patrick swayze is good as quatermain and the supporting cast is superb i find the quality of the supporting cast one of the trademarks of a hallmark production and this film was no exception the cinematography is splendid and the score is perfect if you are looking for entertainment you won't be disappointed
iq is a wonderfully original romantic comedy that pits the greatest and deepest-thinking scientific minds of the century as helpers the juxtaposition of heart and mind is the central theme of this light-hearted yet thoughtful movie you don't quite know how to react because part of the time you are seeing great scientists do silly things to nurture budding love but at other times you hear them discuss some of the deepest puzzles of of our age the end result is a fun movie with surprises throughout walter matthau is a perfect einstein meg ryan creates a quirky scatter-brained mathematician and tim robbins brings to life the contradictions of a poorly educated working man who is fascinated by science all together they create a farcical trip through love and science mind and heart
surely one the french films of the decade so far a taut atmospheric thriller making full use of the lead characters hearing impediment to use sound in a way rarely explored in cinema emannuelle devos gives a truly stunning multi-faceted performance at times devious and manipulative at other times open and vulnerable another reason why those who appreciate quality cinema should keep their eyes open for offerings from france
allow me to just get to the bottom line here i've got kids ages to i consider a trip to the theater a success when there are no talking animals i've seen most of the videos in our collection at least times i can tell you when the film gets reversed in the wizard of oz the sexual joke in el dorado and the tragic flaw with the ending of rudolph the red-nosed reindeer i could probably storyboard nemo from memory makes me support the one child of mine varies who suggests this title for the family movie of an evening in a word of
if you are the sort of person looking for a realistic film or one with a strong and believable plot then this film is not for you hate it however for those who like sweet slightly screwball comedies then you'll have a nice time watching this slight randall works for the irs and he investigates a very nice farmer who never realized he needed to file an income tax return however hard he tries to convince them of the seriousness of his visit everyone in the family is thrilled to have company they dote on him and treat him like one of the have plans on getting him hitched to their daughter debbie reynolds really about all the plot there is but the film gets high marks for a fun script and decent acting a really nice little curio from the late
this film provides us with an interesting reminder of how easy it is for so many to get caught up in the busy occupation of doing nothing we as a people of african descent owe it to ourselves to make a change to this cycle of all talk and no action and start to realise in order to make a change there needs to be less talk and more action it is a powerful statement of the divisions of our people over small issues and our failings to recognise the bigger picture and the need to unite in order to make a difference despite its reference to the black community all viewers can learn something from the message this film seeks to portray
keep in mind i'm a fan of the genre but have only recently seen this film for the first time how i've overlooked it all this time is a wonder to me to me this is a better film then the much lauded high noon a great western with excellent acting and a great story the dvd is in beautifull black and white with outstanding cinematography if you like westerns or james stewart this film is not to be missed
i stumbled on this series rather by accident after half an episode i was hooked american gothic was a dark strange series with gary cole as the mysterious probably evil sheriff buck who is trying to gain control of his illegitimate son caleb played by lucas black i was impressed with gary sinister sheriff and i was even more impressed with lucas black lucas caleb was able to stand up against sheriff buck one of the most frightening characters ever created for a tv series i have rarely seen a child actor with as much presence or talent as lucas black if you were not lucky enough to see lucas in american gothic see him in was a remarkable show with many ambiguities and mysteries that were never explained during short run
antonio danza of blood is an chiller that succeeds on all looks absolutely beautiful in black white and it has wonderfully creepy gothic foster is an english journalist who pursues an interview with visiting american horror writer edgar allan bets foster that he can't spend one night in the abandoned mansion of the is locked in the mansion and the horror film is extremely atmospheric and it scared the hell out of crypt sequence is really eerie and the tension is almost steele looks incredibly beautiful as sinister specter elisabeth of blood is easily one of the best italian horror movies made in early masterpiece
yes be my love was mario skyrocket to fame and still is popular today his voice was strong and steady so powerful in fact that mgm decided to use him in the great caruso lanza himself thought he was the reincarnation of caruso having read the book by kostelanitz who wrote a biography of lanza he explains that the constant practise and vocal lessons became the visionary caruso to lanza there is no doubt that lanza did a superb job in the story but the story is not entirely true blame it on hollywood i used to practise singing his songs years ago and became pretty good myself until i lost my voice because of ten years ago reaching the high note of be my love is not easy but beautiful
the acting is pretty cheesy but for the people in this area up in the and are now detroit area automotive engineers this is a great movie i even work with a japanese supplier so that makes this movie even more leno was showing his age last night on the tonight show he looks pretty young years ago the opening scene with the drag race on what appears to be woodward ave was also owns some bad cars now it would e great to see a remake of this with his modern collection i'm sure the blown vette in the opening scene was his own movie watch it and enjoy no computer generated crap
just such a joy to have watched this intriguing project so refreshing and educating not only to a filmmaker who can learn what can be achieved in minutes of screen time but also as audience who may not be so ready for so much love in such short short films about love in paris are all unique but some of them as expected stand out i thought the tom tykwer portman segment was the best although the mimes made me smile inside just the clicked on spoilers option for this review bus you read is a spoiler enough just watch it don't read what i write but watch the movie smile
this is a movie that should be seen by everyone if you want to see great acting mr torn and ms farrel do an outstanding job i think they should have it on tv again so a new audience can enjoy it wonderful gives you a real feel of what the pioneers had to go through both physically and emotionally great unheard of was done when ms farrel was very young i had always thought of her as a comedian but this certainly is not a comedy and she is just wonderful there is very little dialogs but that just make it seem more real mr torn as always is a great presence and just his breathing has great feeling i must see movie
this is one of the most beautiful films i have ever seen the footage is extraordinary mesmerizing at times it also received an oscar for best photography and deservedly so i have many movies in my film collection and several more i've seen besides them and not many of them are more beautifully or even equally as beautifully shot as this unique and an overall great movie the cast is terrific and do a great job in portraying their characters we follow their destinies with devotion and get very emotionally attached to them along the way we also learn things about ourselves and our lives i think much of this film for what it represent and how it present it i warmly recommend it
a very well made film set in early communist yugoslavia the five young actors who are the teenagers at the center of the story give strong sincere and emotionally deep performances a clear depiction of how the natural trust and naivete inherent in teens can be easily manipulated and how that impacted the rest of their lives highly recommended
the most amazing spiritually uplifting movie about the restoration of the gospel far better than any other film or movie made about the restoration thus far if you haven't seen it hop on a plane to salt lake and see it now you won't regret it you truly get a sense of what the first saints had to struggle through putting complete and total faith in there prophet joseph smith you finally get some sort of comprehension of the things the prophet had to fight through and the persecutions he and his people faced if you have any questions about the church of jesus christ of latter-days saints and our humble beginnings just watch this movie it will make complete and total sense afterward
stunning absolutely stunning this is a movie about two kids father suddenly has a vision he claims an angel visits him and tells him that they need to kill demons he gets instructions later and they start rounding up the demons which are to the naked eye ordinary people they kill these so-called demons with an ax to the head and chop them up burying them in the rose-garden their father claims he can see their sins when he touches them the movie continues with a twist at the thing that i love about this movie is that it perfectly captures the frailty of human perception is their father completely mad or is he telling the truth the audience is left to decide go make the judgment for yourself and see the movie now
doctor mordrid is one of those rare films that is completely under the radar but is totally worthwhile it really reminds me of the old serials from the and which is why i'd have loved to see follow-up movies but judging by the rest of full output there simply weren't enough tits to satisfy the typical audience unfortunately thanks to a completely superfluous sacrifice scene there two too many for a family audience which is unfortunate because without em this could have been a harry potter-style magicfest that kids would have eaten up both jeffrey combs and yvette nipar are great i wasn't sure if ms nipar hadn't wandered off an a-list picture onto this film she was very believable no seriously anyway a shame they didn't have the bucks to license dr strange because i think this could have been a total kiddie phenom
here is one the entire family will enjoy even those who consider themselves too old for fairy tales shelley duvall outdid herself with this unique imaginative take on nearly all of the popular fairy tales of childhood the scripts offer new twists on the age-old fables we grew up on and they feature a handful of stars in each episode cinderella is no exception to standard and in my opinion one of the top five of the series highlighted by jennifer beals her from still in hollywood today making a movie here and there in the title role jean stapleton as the fairy godmother with a southern accent and eve arden as the embodiment of wicked stepmotherhood edie mcclurg day off and jane alden make for a hilarious duo as the stepsisters matthew broderick is an affable prince henry you'll all keep coming back for this one
i just watched the documentary fog city mavericks on the starz cable tv network it is without a doubt one of my most enjoyable viewing experiences ever it chronicles the san francisco bay area artists and creative talent responsible for the some of the best films ever made in addition to the well-known artists listed t also includes segments with irvin kershner caleb deschanel and a segment about pixar animation studios i hope it will be released on dvd-this is a must for any collection about cinema history and brilliant film-making if you are even remotely interested in movies and the people who create them you will not be disappointed
i love this show like watching a mini movie each week the first episode was so gripping and was part of the pilot i'm definitely gonna keep tuning into this show this is the real survivor i've looked at a few of the other comments and i can see that already after just one or two episodes the morons here are already crying wolf sorry if not another reality show kiddies there was once a time where there brace yourself actual tv shows and this one is actually good unlike most of the crappy sitcoms today or the ump-teenth carbon copy of a law order or nypd blue or csi series they're dishing out watch this yourself to form your own opinion don't take one from the boneheads here
one of the comedies of the also has the best signature tune of any comedy show the story is about three people sharing a flat living above their landlords george and mildred the comedy rests on the mix of the people sharing a man and two women richard o sullivan is besotted with paula wilcox its played in a gentle and not a leering way which is why this show was such a scripts and the stars were always giving the best performances and frustrated love life was shown with a relaxed charm the end titles contained visual jokes which went unnoticed in the early but concerned the flat sharers living arrangements
the good earth is a great movie that you don't hear much about anymore there are a lot of big disasters and events but it is also a non-passionate love story all of this happens in a little over two hours which is short by standards the special effects and costumes are very good for the time am surprised that luise rainer received an oscar for such a limiting role she basically only has three emotions submissive hungry and performances by the asian and asian-american actors are
this is one of the funniest series ever i laughed till my sides split and rolled around on the floor if only someone would release in america region or non-pal please know it being released in the uk but region and pal besides give this series its fair shake america must know this series moffat is a genius i loved tracie quirky goofy role in this of course i liked fiona gillies but tracie was a this show in america or show it again on the pbs stations i need to laugh and laugh again please indulge us please for reading
so i don't ruin it for you i'll be very brief some great acting and funny lines from the attractive cast a young graduate of harvard med school white finds out he doesn't know as much as he thinks about people he goes to a small hospital in florida for his internship because a girlfriend left him for a job as a tv producer his senior resident harris helped marvelously by his creative saldana bring him up to speed they help protect his career and show him the wider possibilities that come from being a compassionate doctor instead of a player who just wants to make money seems to be true for many of my pre-med friends
wonderful film one of the best horror films of the she is realistic settings and atmospheres as usual it was inevitable the usual negative comments i have noticed that most horror films of a certain period many times fail to reach even sufficiency obviously because most horror movies are old and must be denigrati is like a mental mechanism that moves the minds of the potential of music critics you read the review already knew what was the final judgment in the film a good gift because is really well done raines reads quite well and the film as a way in which it was produced reminds me a lot of kubrick films he really impression excellent film really i consider a film anthology of
i couldn't hold back the tears when i watched this beautiful documentary it was heart-breaking disturbing and inspiring all in one i recommend this documentary to anyone seeking something that will make them think about what they are doing with their own lives or simply something that will make you think you watch as john lives through the last couple months of his life you watch as he goes through his days with a positive attitude at one point you begin to see that he is truly an amazing individual you begin to understand that he has something to teach all of us his life and struggles will make you cry laugh and find that a lot easier to live if you just take it one day at a time
i just can't understand the negative comments about this film yes it is a typical boy-meets-girl romance but it is done with such flair and polish that the time just flies by henstridge about winning the gene-pool lottery is as magnetic and alluring as ever says the golden age of cinema is dead and vartan holds his is simmering chemistry between the two leads the film is most alive when they share a scene lots it is done so well that you find yourself willing them to get the negative comments if you are feeling a bit blue watch this flick you will feel so much better if you are already happy then you will be i am male from the uk and a hopeless romantic still searching for his princess
the year is ernesto che guevara having been a cuban citizen for the last five from the face of the a glum fidel castro to announce that he is probably in truth he has left cuba to move to bolivia to live an assumed identity whilst living in la undertakes an idea to overthrow the government there once soderberg takes up where one leaves off better this time the pacing is more on job of acting is ever so fine a turn by a sickly looking benecio del che guevara suffice it to probably best if you see both get the true story of guevara what kind of a man he was had the rare open window of opportunity to see both films at one about a long haul as with che-part film has no mpaa rating but contains enough salty language violence to easily snag it an r
this was a favorite christmas special that i wish that they would release on vhs or dvd since my rpm got any cassettes i made are also long am not even a big john denver fan but was very impressed with the music which was mostly traditional favorites with a muppet spin esp little st nick it also contained a few little known songs original though it was done at the end of the this show had a timeless feel to it hoping to find a copy soon
you have to see it to believe it directors alastair fothergill and mark linfield have done a thing really great it is a out of so i can not believe that other user of this web had rate it so poor unless they were expecting to see just a normal movie with people love scenes and so on i am also convinced that this kind of documentaries are an excellent way to wake up us in order to save our beautiful planet finally it has nothing to do with al documentary-movie an inconvenient truth mainly made of long monologues painfully and with truths not always accurate as many scientists have pointed already best thing you can do on earth is not miss earth
gregory peck gives a brilliant performance in this film the last minutes thereabouts are great and peck is an absolute joy to watch the same cannot however be said for the rest of the film not awful and i'm sure it was made with good intentions but the only real reason i were to be honest to see it is peck for the rest you are better off just reading the old testament
if the creators of this film had made any attempt at introducing reality to the plot it would have been just one more waste of time money and creative effort fortunately by throwing all pretense of reality to the winds they have created a comedic marvel who could pass up a film in which an alien pilot spends the entire film acting like jack nicholson complete with the lakers t-shirt do not dismiss this film as trash
this recreation of the infamous murders in kansas based on the capote book is starkly filmed by brooks and cinematographer hall in black and white giving it a documentary feel there are good performances from blake and wilson as the killers and forsythe as a cop who pursues them the scenes leading up to the murders filmed at the actual house where the crime occurred with a soundtrack of whistling winds are quite intense and chilling brooks directs with a lot of verve and uses several interesting transitions between scenes the only complaint is that it is a bit overlong with the denouement dragged out and somewhat preachy
thank god abc picked this up instead of fox the best description those in the know is really wonderfalls meets dead like me in the best way not sure whether an experience with death and destiny early in life makes me a fan of brian fuller but i certainly enjoy his productions i also enjoy checkered floors pies talking toys gravelings and other mischievous items while a bit burtonesque i certainly think this enjoys its own niche that doesn't require j depp or hb carter to be a wonderfully imaginative playground here we can find the joys and sorrows of childhood and adulthood crashing into each and actually making sense and making us want to live life to the fullest
very slick very pre-hays code and still very sassy i would highly recommend seeing this movie even if you are not a fan of stynwyck funny sexy hard-working and love that perm she stynwyck is fantastic as a doozie of a floozy who rises up in the world perfectly portrayed by a bank building john wayne a suit plays one of her first conquests last three minutes are a letdown but the sets the lines the clothes all add to one heck of a movie about rising vertically in the horizontal position
i loves this it showed that they were not killing for fun but to save the ones they loved heath ledger and orlando bloom did a great job portraying ned and joe it has a few quick inappropriate scenes but is all right other than that the language is very mild and sometimes don't even know it is there this movie shows that just because they are outlaws does not mean that they are vicious killers i hope that people will watch this movie and learn about important times in history like this one there is one thing that fascinates me about this movie is that they got their inspiration for their armor from a book ned looked at also that that is how people remember their armor i hope that people will watch this movie and get interested as i have
one of the few best films of all time the change from black and white to colour for the heaven and earth sequences was directorial plot is extremely clever the complete film leaves you overwhelmed by all of the human emotions and although a war film it doesn't discriminate i must have seen this film more times than any other and i never tire of it it is a film that makes you question your own mortality and beliefs on what happens after our demise
i found this movie to be suspenseful almost from the get-go when miss stanwyck starts her narration only a few minutes until you realize that trouble is coming the deserted area the lock on the deserted gas station door everything sets you up to wait for it comes at first you think it will be about the little boy but all too soon you start holding your breath watching the tide coming in i found this movie to be really stressful even though i had watched it before and was prepared for the denouement now a movie that can keep you in suspense even when you have seen it before deserves some sort of special rating maybe a white knuckles award
in the very first episode of friends which aired sept the one where monica gets a roommate there is a song playing as rachel sits in the window towards the end of the show the line that plays is if you ever need holding does anyone know the artist singing or the title of the song it is seems as if it is a great would love to get a copy of it thanks for the assistance i am looking for the it is on so i can purchase it have the shows which are available for purchase and enjoy this show over and over again it just seemed to be for the hours of entertainment you have provided over the years
valentine is now one of my favorite slasher films the death scenes are elaborate and the most of the acting is good marley shelton did great as the female lead better than jennifer love hewitt in the i know films david boreanaz whom is the main reason i saw this movie had a pretty small role but he played it well the exception to the list of good actors is denise richards she was horrible in this the only scene i was glad to see her in was her death scene all in all a good movie to watch you should definitely watch this before you watch scream or i know again
the words are poetry i can't go on another year i got to get to a hotel room i lost my blue scarf in a sea of leaves the marble faun is moving just gave us a washing machine the deal i'm pulverized by this latest thing raccoons and cats become a little bit boring for too long a time any little nest mouse hole i'd like better and there is wisdom in the words yes the pleasure is all mine this little book will keep me straight straight as a dye always one must do everything correctly where the hell did you come from bring me my little radio i've got to have some professional music i'm your mother remember me the relationship is drawn in this magnificent film this is a day film
this movie has one of the cheesiest plots i have seen for me what makes it so awesome fred gwynne and al lewis are very good at what they achieved in the original munsters series while there was less slapstick they still worked wonderfully together comedically i wish yvonne de carlo as lily would have had more plot involvement she showed that she could do comedy in the original series but it was mostly wasted in this movie this movie also stars the great sid caesar but sadly he doesn't have any interaction with gwynne and lewis i think some better work could have come out of that
some critics found this film bleak but for me there was enough good humour and optimism to overcome this impression for example the quietly positive and stoic character of the daughter is the still centre of the film often counterbalancing the unhappy aspects of the setting and film is full of original ideas and characters and the final outcome is not predictable i felt it could've gone either the way many reviews i've read mention the effective use of black and white but the print i saw shown on the sbs tv network here in australia was in full
ayone who whines about how this movie was crap or that it had no plot must have been looking for jean de florrette hello this film was made to be a random act of comedy and in no way involves a plot in any way shape or form i would also like to remind these whiners that if you are going to flay the crap out of this film that they seem to be missing the point this film is clearly made for people who don't appreciate the so called american humour which seems to me just a pile of smutty crap the point is everyone has an opinion and you should be a bit more appreciative that some peoples sense of humour may not be in line with your own before shooting your mouth
the first war to be outsourced dan line says it all this is a hard to describe film comedy satire action screwball it reminded once or twice of dr strangelove especially so in the scenes featuring ben kingsley did a remarkable job i think i had no particular expectations of this film though i am a big john cusack fan so i just let the movie wash over me and as a result i was quite entertained the political satire is painfully accurate and quite damning of the us military-business complex the sub-plots were somewhat predictable but the final interweaving of story lines made them all worthwhile i can understand why this film was not terribly popular in the us but for the rest of the world it is a timely tale
i was so glad i came across this short film i'm always so disappointed that short films are hard to come across so when i saw this and saw that it was nominated for the live action short film at the academy awards i was so pleased that i actually had a film that i was rooting plot is pretty simple the director writer and star nacho vigalondo tried coming up with a reason people would suddenly break out into a song and dance number like they do in movie musicals the result is extremely entertaining and the song is actually really a well made short film well edited and the actors all do a great job and the last shot of the film is highly recommend this film
i was very surprised how much i enjoyed this film i thought it was funny sexy painful and warm andie performance was nuanced and vulnerable for once the director of a macdowell film did not make her beauty another character in the film the romance between kate and her young man is lovely to watch and it plays out very well her relationship with her friends is both a thorn and a balm in her life imelda stalinson who has been a mvp in so many british films does a great job in this there is some tragedy in this but i think the film is saved in the end by the brilliant acting clean direction and witty film quality is excellent and the music is good too though unavailable on sound track
i really enjoyed the detail that went into the rhys myers and jewel were outstanding in their support roles as was jeffery wright toby mcguire gave as fine a acting job as ever depicted when he had to amputate his best arm knowing he would die without the procedure to detail with good dialect coaching to catch the southern accent incredibly this movie was swept under the rug by the hollywood promoters i can only imagine i have strong suspicions which makes it all the more appealing to me i have given a dozen dvd copies out for overlooked movie rent or buy it and give it your full attention for a couple of hours then judge
although not as creepy as cult classic predecessor i actually like this one better this is because of faster pace better settings and cool soundtrack loaded with action and has sweet gore effects by lucio fulci the zombies don't quite look as nasty as in zombi but they still look good it was made pretty well but it definitely has share of cheesiness for instance some zombies move really slow while others are as quick as ninjas some are braindead while others say funny lines but who expects consistency when it comes to italian horror even a flying zombie head how rad is that definitely a must see for gorehounds and zombie fans it'd probably satisfy most fans of action movies as well also check out zombi
this one tends to get slighted by a lot of critics and kurosawa fans but i thought it was wonderful an episodic multi-character study of poorest who live in a city literally made from garbage though it looks like an a-bomb just hit the film has a sort of serene beauty thanks to the glorious use of technicolor the title comes from the sound made by the insane young man who drives an imaginary trolley through the slum all the characters were wonderful and all the stories engrossing but perhaps the most tragic concerns the man and his young son who live in an abandoned car when not searching for food they spend their spare time using their imagination to build their dream house an emotionally moving and beautiful film
well i said it all in the summary i simpley adore the movie and the would give each actor an great now and i watched it times in different periods and i always think i won't cry and i always do about or times meryl s was absolutely brilliant jeremy irons wish the movie received more awards i really don't know anybody who watched it and didn't loved it also glenn close was fantastic the story was beautiful and sad at the same time i loved the fact that despite everything clara and esteban loved each other so much and how blanca was close to her parents
this was another great tom berenger movie but some people are right it was like another sgt barnes character but it was still awsome tom berenger played a great sniper in the jungles of panama billy zane was a wuss at first just like cpl upham from saving private ryan but then he got a little more aggresive in the end sniper was awsome and action buffs should watch it i remind you it wouldnt have as much action as a reg action flick i got this one on dvd too and it is excellent
did not know what to expect from from van partner friend his fight choreographer for most of his films it was nice to see him act as tong po in kickboxer and other van films now on his own he and his wife make a great team in this one qissi is the action director and lead bad guy and good really meanacing his wife was the writer producer and directed most of the scenes which didn't require action she also did good job editing the film together they did a great job the story made sense the fight scenes were edited well the leads were real fighters and looked good together the story came together well and if you can beleive bad language no sex just action a new one on me check it out
the only show i have watched since why did they discontinue it it was the only show that captured the essence of hawaii and made you feel like you are a part of it all the least they should do is release it on dvd checked out similar shows but nothing has come close the cast had incredible chemistry and i looked forward to each episode with much anticipation made a big mistake by pulling that show if anyone has any info regarding where i can obtain a dvd of north shore please post a few lines here thanks aloha
glacier fox is one of the most heartrending and wonderfully photographed wildlife films ever film makes you care about each member of this fox family from the blind cub to the strongest their adventures are at times hilarious and also tragic set against an inhospitable countryside the hearts warm to the family music score and lyrics tell the story intercut with narration about what is happening in general remains one of the biggest predators but we are left in no doubt that the foxes are capable of living not just surviving beyond human endeavours
great drama with all the areas covered except for screenlay which was too slow and should have shown more relevant scenes like character interviewing the pitt getting murdered instead of just having it described to like those would have kept the audience away some useless minutes could have made more room for more heartpounding scenes like dragging of the film kept this one from all time greatness although to see pitt here makes the film so worth fans of century styles and montana will really like this as well
this is a brilliant and well made contribution by a group of fans and considering made in a back bedroom on a painted green screen story lines are complex and twisting and characters show realistic depth and dimension the cgi created by the crew is breathtaking while first season might be a little shaky final few are well thought out and well shot some fans might have thought that the star trek franchise had come to an end with the early cancellation of enterprise but these fans don't take no for an answer i recommend this to fans and newcomers alike hidden frontier it so
i saw this film at the international film festival of brussels i also met the director of the film i heard that ed wood wrote the story in years i'm sure he thought his would be his masterpiece his if you take the film seriously mr wood did it is really one of the worst films you will ever see and this is cool the big joke of i woke up early the day i died is that it doesn't even try to be a decent makes the film very very good the script is filled with nihilism and anarchism a lot of black humour billy role is absolutely excellent you see this is either high low
up until the sixth and last episode of the star wars saga which finally ended in i had always looked at this entry as my favorite film of the long-running series the varied action scenes and really different characters the hut furry woodland creatures etc made this a particularly appealing of the action ever focused too long in one spot either the last half hour exemplifies this the most as the scene switches every few minutes from the woods to the battle among space ships to the individual laser-duel between luke skywalker and darth nice characteristic this film had that the two previous did not was the absence of in-fighting between two of the stars gone was the incessant bickering between carrie fisher and harrison ford finally everyone was on the same page it was nice to the end this was simply a wonderful adventure tale more than anything else
heart-warming to see a movie that doesn't bash males in this one the leaves her family to get in touch with herself or pursue her libido the father stays with and nurtures the kids letting neither his work nor his love life interfere with his love of and responsibility to them
if tv was a baseball league this show would have a perfect record with an excellent cast and a perfect plot this show gave amazing seasons and a great joy to tv after dinner with the constant changing of relationships and finding out who real dad is this show was a hit when it started in august of though it was set in and hanging out in foremans basement was always the thing to do back then and it still is today along with show gave great laughs in premieres and it still does during re-runs if you watch a few episodes of this show you will get everything and want to get more now only is this show one of the best ever created it is clever and funny
ok who brought the cheese i love it during run it became a phenomenon the anorexic twins became saget started making a paycheck of his really funny stand-up and people knew who dave coulier was this is when life was good and simple this is one of the great american classics it was humorous and always brought home a good lesson and this is where i differ from the norm i liked the last few seasons like home improvement when children get older there are a lot more you can do with the script this is why i dare could have gone much later than it did but anyway i gave it an because of its wholesome funny story lines and because of bob saget
once again proving his amazing versatility john turturro plays the introspective russian chess genius preparing for a comeback tournament and forging an unlikely relationship with a gadabout fellow resident watson at a italian hotel they fall in the horror of her social-mountaineering mother wonderful love story whose gloss of chess might make it appear in spite of its origins in a nabakov story it certainly is not the romantic elements and the sense of time and place beat the psychological analysis hands turturro having appeared in barton fink o art thou the big lebowski proves that he is not dependant on coen bros films to assert his stature
this movie is proof that film noire is an enduring style and extremely worthy of stay alive for me it is he best example of film noire since will unfortunately never get the recognition it deserves it was never promoted properly when it was first released and has had to build its cadre of fans through venues like vanguard cinema and word of mouth rental highly recommend that people looking for something more than mindless entertainment rent this movie and delved into its highly convoluted plot
i would say that this film gives an insight to the trauma that a young mind can face when a family is split by divorce or other disaster i would highly recommend this film especially to parents or individuals planning to have a found the characters to be appealing and highly sympathetic from a multitude of scary monster although probably not scary to most adults has a very real hint of what the overactive imagination of a child who is facing unknown terrors might found the film to be delightful
after seeing all the jesse james quantrill films in the fifties it is quite a thrill to see this film with a new perspective by director ang lee the scene of the attack of lawrence kansas is awesome the romantic relationship between jewel and toby mcguire turns out to be one of the best parts and jonathan rhys-meyers is outstanding as the bad guy all the time this film makes you feel the horror of war and the desperate situation of the main characters who do not know if they are going to survive the next hours definitely worth seeing
hurrah a space film that doesn't take itself too seriously and everyone can come along for the exciting ride that is space camp the film starts slowly the usual mix of idiots and high-fliers mixed together into a dodgy soup but when the going gets tough the tough get themselves sorted out and not an un-believable change in the characters as you can believe that some responsibility in their young only flaw in the film is that kate capshaw is extremely annoying as the i'm right and you're all wrong instructor i would recommend this as a nice night in movie and a vote
this film was on last week and although at that time of the day the quality of the movies is almost never good least here on mexican tv i couldn't switch the tv off the story about madelene moore really touches you she doesn't come across as a very sympathetic character at first but seeing the whole film you just want her so succeed this film really leaves you thinking and i think that basically due to the great acting of brooke johnson i had never heard of her before nor knowingly seen her in another film but this was great great acting compliments to brooke i hope to see her in another film soon
story of a wrongly executed prisoner who haunts the prison he was electrocuted in and kills random prisoners while waiting to take revenge on the man who framed mortensen is great and the acting is pretty good overall lane smith is deliciously wicked as the guilty warden also this film has some great gore including death by barbed-wire mummification
one of the most beautiful movies ever made in ex is very familiar to people in ex yul because generation after war used to live in the same in the west cant imagine how political situation in our country affect plot is in the josip broz tito said no to the sssr and politbiro and because of that our borders becomes open for western a country were people didn't had much money jeans was only ideal and friendship was friendship between for young people an a girl was so strong that after years of their emigration from yu is still get together after all this years on funeral and they start to remember of their their went to the emigration and become successful people
you can do a lot with a little cash blair witch proved that this film supports it it is no more than a sitcom in length and complexity however because it has john cleese as sherlock holmes it manages to be hilarious even on a budget that couldn't afford a shoestring the highlight of this film is arthur lowe as the sincere bumbling watson his dimness and slowness foils quick-tempered wit if you ever run across the film watch it for a quirky laugh or two
yeah a chick flick and it moves kinda slow but actually pretty good and i consider myself a manly man you gotta love judy davis no matter what in and the girl who plays her daughter gives a natural convincing scenery of the small coastal summer spot is beautiful and plays well with the major theme of the movie the unknown least unknown to me actors and actresses lend a realism to the movie that draws you in and keeps your attention overall i give it an go see it
this is one of the best movies out there and saying a lot being that it was for television i really wish it was on hunt gave such a raw performance she played a rookie cop thrown into serial killer case perfectly when she falls apart because he kills another kid it was amazing she is so alone so he gets to her when she talks about her mother weber as the serial killer was so shocking he really brought her into his dark world it was oscar-worthy when he talks about killing the kids scary when he realizes who she really is what a really don't make them like that anymore it was a real thriller without being gory
magnificent and unforgettable stunningly atmospheric and brilliantly acted by really cannot understand what sort of people are panning this masterpiece and giving the preponderance of votes as nine along with grapes of wrath is john greatest movie i would say that long voyage home is next in line though quite a way it deserves a
i can't tell you all how much i love this movie i have read reviews that say that this move is too confusing or like swimming in drying concrete i say that these reviewers have no imagination for anyone who loves fantasy fiction this movie is for you if you ever loved playing dungeons dragons this movie is for you if you got into the oriental adventures i'm just sorry that i did not get to see this movie on the big screen more incentive to get my own big screen
mystery men is one of those movies that gets funnier over time there is a naive innocence and niceness to the characters it has become part of our family culture and we quote the characters often it is my favorite film of the last two years my kids are and and we all three love this film great acting and comedy we love galaxy quest and monty python flicks too okay we're not talking intellectual here just family bonding
only saw this show a few times but will live in my memory is very frustrating that it is so difficult to find this anywhere to purchase and yet there seem to be endless repeats of stuff like friends especially even more difficult to obtain being in england i say it was low ratings or was it a complaint from the bakersfield pd themselves maybe it was just too clever for certain people just about the one comedy i would love to see again but is almost impossible to find i hear it is being or has been repeated on another network but alas not over ingenious
if you r in mood for want to just relax and miyan chote miyan is one of the movies to watch amitabh started off pretty it is govinda who steals the show from his hands awesome timing for and good dialog inspired from bad boys but it has indian masala to it people think it might be confusing and the fact that david dhavan is directing and govinda is acting should not raise any recommended movies in the same shola aur shabnam aankhen raja babu saajan chale sasural deewana mastana collie no jodi no hero haseena manjayegi ek aur ek gyarah
this film may have a questionable pedigree because it was made for tv but it is one of the best movies i've seen the film and its actors won several awards it is gripping fascinating and it will absorb you completely the story of a chase for a killer in iron-curtain russia by people who are willing to risk their careers to try to save lives of future victims would be a compelling story if it were fiction but ostensibly a true story i highly recommend it
brilliant film the next best film to the drunken master chan i recently bought it on an original vhs and i haven't seen this film for years but still as good as it was back then the acting was terrible and the dubbing was even worse but it those features that make this film many other old fashioned chinese kung-fu movies great the choreography is awesome and the storyline is basic i have never seen the chamber of shaolin but know it is the same film but gordon liu plays san te but san te in thr return to the chamber is played by a different character it has a lot of comedy value and brilliant kung-fu
everyone plays their part pretty well in this little nice movie belushi gets the chance to live part of his life differently but ends up realizing that what he had was going to be just as good or maybe even better the movie shows us that we ought to take advantage of the opportunities we have not the ones we do not or cannot have if u can get this movie on video for around be an investment
if you have sons or daughters who love action adventure intrigue and imagination without the need to break into song every twelve minutes then this is the disney movie for you my sons loved every minute of this film and i have to admit that i laughed out loud many times throughout the movie there are no sappy songs to get in the way of a wonderfully told story and the characters are all lovable and identifiable in their own right this should go down as one of the disney classics because of its beautifully illustrated scenery and its non-stop excitement
there should be a sub-genre in the western called the robert mitchum western brilliant idiosyncratic usually undervalued westerns import his film noir persona to etch some compellingly dark character sketches and bring an elegiac world-weariness more familiar from the films of sam peckinpah man with the gun is one of his best directed by orson welles protege richard wilson it is a stark monochrome beauty full of chilling silhouettes and terrifying outbursts of savage violence as mitchum comes to tame a town terrorised by a monopolist with a private army regression from soft-spoken stranger to deranged murderer with a host of dark emotions in between is a marvel of expressive physical acting
although most certainly politically incorrect to be entertained by a drunk such a charm to dudley portrayal of lovable lush arthur bach one can't help but feel for this unique and wonderful character how can you not be entertained by that infectious laugh and giggle and utter silliness although i'm not really a liza minnelli fan she was really excellent as linda marolla and i couldn't picture anyone else in that role sir john gielgud was the heart of the film and deserved his oscar the rest of the cast also excellent and that great tune theme wow truly this was one of the best comedies of the great films get better with each viewing and that is the case with arthur
inspirational tales about triumph of the human spirit are usually big turn-offs for me the most surprising thing about men of honor is how much i enjoyed it in spite of myself the movie is as predictable and cliched as it gets but it works much credit goes to the exhilarating performances by both leads a perfect role for cuba gooding jr wonderfully restrained here we have come to expect a lot from de niro and he doesn't disappoint he creates a darkly funny portrait director george tillman jr set out to make an old-style flick and comes up with a winner
i saw this at dances with films and it was awesome i really felt for jake talk about adding insult to injury not only are your parents getting divorced but a monster after you was both heartfelt and scary there were several moments where the audience screamed in genuine fright it kind of reminded me of a japanese horror film except that the story was actually what separated closet from the usual indy film pabulum an excellent script with compelling characters also by mixing elements of the horror film with family drama the movie gets the best out of both genres and avoids the clichés of not coming out in theaters definitely get the dvd
not for people without swift mind or without a drop of balkan blood in their veins if you don't have any of these you can not understand it and if you don't understand you can't enjoy it for example if you think picasso is a name of a car produced by citroen probably if you see a painting you just will walk by it deciding that a trash-work of some street painter so do not judge before trying to understand it in the end i think a must for every one with open minds still my remains the shawshank redemption and remember that not all things can be put in frames because there are things in this world that any frame just won't fit
new york has never looked so good and neither has anyone in this movie while the script is a bit lightweight you can't help but like this movie or any of the characters in it you almost wish people like this really existed the appeal of the actors are what really put it ritter colleen camp and the late dorothy stratten are particularly good go ahead and rent or buy this movie you'll be glad you did
i realize this review will get me bashed by the expert film critics patrolling this site but i will defend this dentist is actually a really good film the acting isn't always top notch but the thrills are good and the good plus you see linda boobies not that i'm an expert in this field but the direction seems good and the plot makes sense corbin makes a great creepy dentist it does to dentists what jaws does to it obviously had a fairly limited budget but they did well with it what they could and developed the characters well that end
after a long hard week behind the desk making all those dam serious decisions this movie is a great way to relax like wells and the original radio broadcast this movie will take you away to a land of alien humor and sci-fi paraday captain zippo died in the great charge of the buick he was a brave man the jack nicholson impressions shine right through that alien face with the dark sun glasses and leather jacket and always remember to beware of the doughnut of death keep in mind the number one rule of this movie suspension of disbelief sit back and relax and prepare to die earth scum you just have to see it for yourself
all this talk about this being a bad movie is nonsense as a matter of fact this is the best movie i've ever seen an excellent story and the actors in the movie are some of the best i would not give criticism to any of the actors that movie is the best and it will always stay that way
this is one of may all-time favourite films parker character is over-the-top entertaining and the librarian motif won't be lost on anyone who has ever worked in the books and stacks you're a library student rent this then buy the poster and hang it on your wall the soundtrack is highly recommendable too i've shown this film to more library friends than any other they all fall in love with it
this comic book style film is funny has nicely paced action and a great futuristic style to it writer steven de souza who also wrote commando gives arnie plenty of lines to dish out send me a copy after signing a contract and stabbing a pen into the lawyers back what a pain in the neck after strangling subzero with barbed wire he had to split after slicing his body between his legs and finally as killian slams through a billboard bearing his own face arnie concludes now that hit the spot funnily enough bears some similarities total recall another sci-fi flick starring schwarzenegger
i can't remember many films where a bumbling idiot of a hero was so funny throughout leslie cheung is such the antithesis of a hero that too dense to be seduced by a gorgeous vampire i had the good luck to see it on a big screen and to find a video to watch again and again
masks is a moving film that works on many levels at its simplest it is the haunting story of a street performer who bonds with a young child while trying to pass along his creative art to the next generation although at times the story makes the old man into a job it is so well crafted acted directed wonderful production values it is easy to move beyond his plight and if you hang with it the film is ultimately very sweet and uplifting kudos all around this is a wonderful film for children as well as adults the trick is how to get americans who may not like foreign language films to see it
i wasn't expecting to be so impacted by this film portraying a family just like the one you'd expect to be living next door they are ordinary flesh-and-blood people not like the typical hollywood fare they face an all too common illness but the story-line grips the heart with a powerful lesson casting script direction and acting flow together with a surge that draws the viewer deep into the story give this film your full attention and its message will truly inspire
first off let me say i have wanted to see this movie for about a year now because i knew angelina jolie was in it and i love her but my love for her has nothing to do with my opinion of the movie anyhow no video stores carried it but low and behold the local library did i watched it and absolutely loved it yes there were italian stereotypes but it was done well and funny it was not degrading in any actor and actress did a superb job i laughed very hard at the sexual humor overall i think this movie is well worth seeing if you can find it it is adorable and just plain fun to watch i rarely rank movies as a but i give this one a find it and watch it
a very funny east-meets-west film influenced by the closure of flint michigan plant in the eighties and the rise and integration of japanese automakers in the us set in western pennsylvania it features great performances by michael keaton gedde watanabe and george wendt music by blues legend stevie ray vaughan
i saw this on the big screen and was encapsulated with it the period of queen younger years are a mystery and this is a perfect description of how a young girl was thrusted into one of the highest roles in the script is perfect the acting is amazing the history and attention to detail is out of this world emily blunt is perfect as victoria funny how her mother is played by elizabeth the and william iv is played by prince albert portrayal of victoria shows that she was a rebellious young woman once i'm sure she would have been on jeremey kyle show if it had been around then my mother and her boyfriend are trying to steal my perfect piece of a major part of british and commonwealth history
i first saw breaking glass in and thought that it would be one of the movie classics this film is a great look into the music industry with a great cast of performers this is one film that should be in the collection of everyone and any one that wants to get into the music industry i can't wait for it to be available on dvd
i haven't laughed that much in a long time although the movie has some sad moments too especially when it changes from hyper-funny to honest and serious the characters are very realistic most of the times sappy sometimes but quite believable i am not a fan of the jerry springer show i feel sorry for the participating people this film instead is a satire and it is doing bad that all expletives were out while this movie aired on public tv that takes a lot of fun out of it i will go rent this movie to fully enjoy
anyone who doesn't like this film is one who is afraid to explore his or her own demons this film does make the viewer a little uncomfortable at times but that is its intention it asks you to look at your own life and confront the obstacles head on like lou eventually does it asks you to overcome the fear of perception and become who you are meant to be bret carr holds up a mirror unlike any filmmaker has the intention and the message is clear and profound apprehension about this film stems only from their own insecurities an open-minded viewer takes this inspirational message and runs with it sometimes a changing realization does come in a flash a light bulb going on this story is real and changes the lives if its viewers in a real way
radio was not a hour a week happening when i grew up in the england so hour was a treat for me when we had batteries and an accumulator to spare for the power the few programmes i heard therefore made a great impression on my young mind and the that i recall still are toytown one about all the animals at the zoo and grey owl talking about the animals he knew which he called his brothers it was only in recently that i learnt that grey owl wasn't a genuine indian but the tribute paid by the sioux chief makes great sense to me a man becomes what he dreams would that we could all dream as world changing and beneficial as archie grey owl belaney would that a new grey owl could influence world leaders to clean up the environment
tess of the storm country is possibly the best movie of all of mary films at two hours it was quite long for a silent film yet continues to hold your interest some years after it was filmed mary gives one of her finest performances at times the role seems like a greatest hits performance with bits of mary the innocent mary the little devil mary the little mother mary the spitfire mary the romantic heroine etc characteristics that often were used throughout a single film in the past the movie is surprisingly frank about one supporting illegitimate child for and at one point our little mary is thought the unwed mother in question if the academy awards had been around in no doubt the best actress oscar for the year would have been
roman troy moronie is my comment on the movie what else is there to character really brings out the moron in moronie a tough gangster with an inability to pronounce profane words well it seems that it would have been frustrating to be tough and yet not be able to express oneself intelligently moronie will go down in the annals of movie history as one of the greatest of all is of course great comedy among the other characters michael keaton is and so is joe just like the fact that moronie kept the movie from an r rating because he could not pronounce profanity
i thoroughly enjoyed this film overall but four things really stand out sam perfect comic timing and performance as the camp alan wonderful characterisation of the camp owner and best of all the cinematography the beautiful golden tones of the exterior scenes draws me into the film like a sunset at the lakeshore draws me into my own summer dialog and mood feel very natural and believable some reviewers criticise the lack of a more profound script to me it is exactly that lack that makes this film work the characters and their problems seem real and because of that i care about what happens to bottom line is that all the parts come together to create a whole that feels right
i really liked the ending i was in film is watch the movie you will enjoy could have given it ranking more than liked the teasing between chance and like the leadership of this movie was sequel is good but not good as this think there should be a third sequel to only this film attracts children but also whole family enjoyed this was full of is an intelligent i say this movie is a must more u see this movie the more you are attached with this movie is a classic
i watch cold case because of the real life experiences depicted this one was very close to me and touched me deeply so beautifully handled thanks merideth all the characters are well developed especially coop the material is still difficult to approach the us is far behind the developed nations of the world only this kind of honest actual experiential portrayal and treatment makes an impact on the population of course not everyone sees things the same way but i am heartened that of the men polled in the under crowd voted the same as me you're reaching the hard ones i will forever reserve the best episode place for this episode please continue taking chances and accept my heartfelt gratitude
i first saw this movie in my plays playwrights course at tulane i was awed at how beautiful and raw this documentary was it is a sincere look into the unedited reality of a life of solitude the family is fascinating and i thought it really showed little edie at her core a side note my professor even told me that throughout the filming little edie became infatuated with one of the camera the beauty i find comes from the naturalness of the dysfunction it is evident in the relationship between mother and daughter that neither could function in society alone and you begin to wish for little rehabilitation to society in all the film is gripping in its aesthetic quality and portrayal of surprising beauty two thumbs way up
i thought the river of souls was a very good babylon movie with some exceptional performances from martin sheen tracy scoggins and ian macshane if this were an episode of the series the humour it would probably be one of my favourite stand-alone stories of the i've always preferred scoggins to christian although granted jms didn't write her as well for much of the series and she did have to endure the plot if you take out the smutty humour about the brothel and the poorer actors in those scenes then this movie is solid stuff probably my third favourite of the four movies but in no means bad at all
amazing effects for a movie of this time a primer of the uselessness of war and how war becomes a nurturer of wonderful thing about this movie is it is now public domain and available at no charge no sign up necessary watch it in one sitting and you will be plan to share this flick with as many people as possible as i had never heard of it before and i am a hard core sci fi would like to see how others react to this us what you think
i picked this one up on a whim from the library and was very pleasantly surprised lots of tight expressionistic camera work an equally tight script and two superb actors all meld together to make one very fine piece of film not for the reptilian multiplex brain but rather the true aficionado of cinema if hollywood ever does get its grimy hands on it i'm sure it will ruin it a choice treat all the way around other posters here have more than amply sung its praises so i needn't bother duplicating their paeans just take their advice and mine and don't miss this gem call it what you like i call it two hours of entertainment well-spent read my lips don't miss it
this movie is a lot of fun the actors really make the movie go the distance though without giving away the plot i would describe it as a new princess bride cult favorite that should stand the test of time you get to see a whole different side to robert deniro in this movie the price of admission just for that all the elements are there from adventure to romance and well placed of all ages will enjoy it parents even did good special effects may be scary for the little ones good date movie great for some an a it does well at the box office
along with darkwing duck this is unfairly cancelled disney has been in decline since tarzan and we need a show like this to get disney back on track ed gilbert and jim cummings were perfect for the voices of louis and baloo familiar the theme theme tune is also catchy out of all the villains which are all great on their own merits tony jay stands out as shere kahn louis and baloo actually sound very similar to the voice overs in the jungle book which isn't a bad thing at all as a matter of fact quite inspirational the animation was spot on and the script had plenty of wit that has been severely lacking in animations for years please bring this show back bethany cox
this movie is one of the funniest saddest and most accurate portrayals of the mentality that seems to have pervaded the balkans yet again years after the time depicted all the usual characters and conflicts are presented with such anger sadness and love combined that it is impossible to decide whether crying or laughing would be the more appropriate response the accuracy of portrayal and the timelessness of the types however make it for a great film to watch if one wants to understand a little bit of what drove ex-yugoslavia to its madness in fact no diplomat dealing with the region should attempt anything until they saw this movie and its twin trce pocasni did i mention it is one of the funniest movies i've ever seen
i liked the film some of the action scenes were very interesting tense and well done i especially liked the opening scene which had a semi truck in it a very tense action scene that seemed well of the transitional scenes were filmed in interesting ways such as time lapse photography unusual colors or interesting angles also the film is funny is several parts i also liked how the evil guy was portrayed too i'd give the film an out of
very sly for all of the look to the movie the humor is quite gentle but it grew on me much more than i expected the cast is first-rate and they appear to be having a wonderful time ustinov wanders through the film muttering some quite funny things under his breath and all very inconsequential i'll buy the movie as soon as it comes out on dvd the plot is that ustinov as an embezzler released from prison posing as a computer whiz and embezzling money from an american company with an office in london maggie smith is his secretary for a while and watching her get fired from many different jobs is part of the fun bob newhart is his usual deadpan self and karl malden has fun as the dense and sleazy executive running the london office the ending is funny and nicely cynical
whoever says pokemon is stupid can die this movie is superlative i even shead a tear when celebei died i don't cry much this film is a touching animated thriller this fourth installment of pokemon ash and friends must stop the bad jerk from making celebei the ultimate evil weapon with his dark ball in the time sam and celebei travel through time and continuously are hunted by game hunters i like the part with the double battle and sam has the apricorn pokeball you've played pokemon gold silver or crystal you know what it also enjoyed having miramax in charge instead of warner brothers putting the mini movie at the end was a great idea the pokemon in this movie come to life more than ever
the most moving and truly eye opening documentary ever created i cried the whole way through from start to end watching the show you are immediately captured by a struggle to live without pain to live a life we would take for granted the first time i heard the title i was almost scared to see the program it was hard for me to comprehend living in agony every day of every year of my life i truly felt for him the saddest part of the documentary is when jonny picks out his coffin could you imagine doing that even more so even though he was in excruciating and unbearable pain he still opened up his own charity is one of the only people that deserves true respect and admiration he is the definition of a role model what a true and undeniable hero he was
so finally i know it exists along with the other uk contributors on here i saw this on what must have been only uk screening in the i remembered the title but got nowhere when i mentioned it to people it scarred me but when you go to bed with doom whizzing about your brain and listening all around for impending terror then isn't that what a truly classic horror movie is all about i can barely remember the intricacies of the movie but what i do recollect is my shivering flesh and heightened senses can anyone confirm my suspicions that this is black and white again if anyone has any info on how to obtain a copy of this please get in touch
a classy offering from amicus producer milton subotsky and director peter duffell far pavillions etc turn in a classy intelligent four-hander with a strong cast cushing christopher lee jon pertwee ingrid pitt etc all giving stylish performances despite a low budget which results in a few un-special effects the most outstanding contribution however is that of the chloe franks who turns in chillingly effective account of her part which makes blood run cold only spoilt by the lurid title wished on the film by its distributors this underrated release a cut above the run-of-the-mill blood n guts shocker movie is for those who appreciate a little thought with their horror
i got to see this on the plane to nz last week and was wondering how it would measure up to both the uk film and the book i have to say i was favorable impressed if anything the fanatical attachment to the red sox during the lean years works even better than the original devotion to arsenal fc who have had success through the years as a brit i was also interested to see that you don't need to understand baseball to get going on one question springs to mind was the screenplay written using the sox as the team even before they finally broke the curse of the bambino or was another team in the frame as a red sox fan myself i know a brit who understands baseball i have to say that it added to the enjoyment
i don't understand the low rating on this film a delight for people who like a strong suspense plot and dark atmospherics the tone is reminiscent of midnight in the garden of good and evil down to the locale the acting is strong and i was amazed at the verisimilitude of kenneth southern accent famke jansen is great robert duval is effective in a small part and embeth davitz is the bomb great full nude scene of plot is fairly standard but effectively executed
johny to makes here one of his best style exercises making a strong film with a good story the election of the new boss is the beginning of a war inside the my opinion the violence is wise used in the context making a very strong gangs film i specially love the way he tells the history moving around all the roles inside the family and making that we see the violence like the only way they have to solve their about the technical aspects the film is a good example of paused rythmic and planified way of shooting a film one of the hong kong films of the year is like infernal affairs but without the easy action-violence scenes and the confused storyline strongly recommended to all asian films for my english better do in spanish lol
rachel griffiths writes and directs this award winning short film a heartwarming story about coping with grief and cherishing the memory of those we've loved and lost although only minutes long griffiths manages to capture so much emotion and truth onto film in the short space of time bud tingwell gives a touching performance as will a widower struggling to cope with his death will is confronted by the harsh reality of loneliness and helplessness as he proceeds to take care of pet cow tulip the film displays the grief and responsibility one feels for those they have loved and lost good cinematography great direction and superbly acted it will bring tears to all those who have lost a loved one and survived
having the opportunity to watch some of the filming in the slavic village-broadway area i couldn't wait to see final this film at the cleveland premier last friday i haven't laughed out loud at a comedy in a long time it is great slapstick the russo brothers did a fine job directing the entire cast performs their best comedic acting no slow or dry segments george clooney is one of my favorite actors and great as the crippled safe breaker in this flick i was most imprest by william h macy as crook riley and michael as toto they keep you in stitches i believe they have the funniest roles in the entire movie
i've watched the first episodes and this series is simply amazing i haven't been this interested in an anime series since neon genesis evangelion this series is actually based off an h-game which i'm not sure if been done before or not i haven't played the game but from what i've heard it follows it very give this series a it has a great story interesting characters and some of the best animation i've seen it also has some great japanese music in it you haven't seen this series yet check it out you can find subbed episodes on some anime websites out there straight out of japan
deliverance is one of the best exploitation films to come out of that wonderful decade from whence so many other exploitation films group of friends sets out on a canoe trip down a river in the south and they become victimized by a bunch of toothless hillbillies who pretty much try to ruin their lives are treated to anal rape vicious beatings bow and arrow killings shootings broken bones etc a lot like texas chainsaw massacre to say that deliverance is believable would be immature this would never and could never happen even in the dark ages of is a very entertaining ride and packed full of action it is one in a huge pile of exploitation films to come from the early and it sits on top of that pile with great acting superb cinematography and excellent out of kids
this scary and rather gory adaptation of stephen great novel features outstanding central performances by dale sadly died few years denise crosby and some really gruesome gore mary lambert has a wonderful sense of visual manages to make this one of the few versions of work that is not only worth genuinely depiction of the zombie child hughes-later in new equally what could easily have been a laughable character is made menacing and for the think that this one isn't scary-watch it alone in the with your squeamish i guarantee you that pet sematary will creep you horror movies like this one or the texas chain saw massacre shouldn't be watched in for horror fans
this is one great movie i have played all the nancy drew games and have read the books and i never expected the movie to be so exciting and funny if you never heard of nancy drew read the first book of the old clock so you can kinda get used to nancy then you can watch the movie because in the movie they don't really introduce the characters names fast my whole family enjoyed it and the plot was extremely interesting this is an ultimate come-back from the previous nancy drew movies which the nancy drew actor didn't seem to match this movie is much like alex rider stormbreaker so cool nancy drew lovers you must watch this
this show is freaking hilarious the jokes are original god and i love eric and kelso yeah i know what they say after the season not funny anymore because eric and kelso are no longer in the show and randy is a real dumbass randy is comparing to eric and kelso cant take the funniest characters and switch em with i'm a cool guy kind of guy it isn't his fault anyway but the writers are trying to keep the season funny still is not as much as the earlier seasons but its are awesome the circle red is a real kind of mental-abusing dad and kitty is always half-high half-pie hyde tries to be cool all the time he has his moments too the least favrioutes characters are jackie and donna they're cool but not without kelso and show dumbass
she is such an extraordinary singer who cares about anything else that final scene is one of the best moments in all of show biz bar none i'm glad she kept the camera on herself for ten minutes she deserves that iconic status such is the power of the voice first saw this film when i was five and it had a huge impact on me i see it today and yes i can see some of the flaws esther wanting to leave the right as her award is being some of the other user comments are just plain false i mean where is the gratuitous nudity maybe we saw different films singing ability is monumental and if she has a big ego fine earned it
i have been wanting to see cut since the day i have heard of it which was sometime last year anyway i got to see today and when the movie started i thought that it started rather week but it got better after mins or so i thought that the movie was pretty good but the thing i didn't like was how the killer was created i was thinking just before i rented that it would probably suck just like urban legends final cut i almost died it mostly everything in ul final cut needed to be improved cut is times better than cut the best part of cut is the killer and the death scenes the killer kicks mo give cut a out of
it was released in france on dvd several years wish it would be re-released with english subtitles do not confuse this with a remake with penelope cruz which gets poor reviews gerard phillippe is a peasant who is told by a fortune teller that he will marry the daughter of the king he sets off to join the army and goes to war his love however is gina lollabrigida in an early movie for her i won't spoil the end gerard phillippe died a few years later at a young age a great loss to moviedom
action horror sci-fi exploitation director fred olen ray shows he has some talent as a director character actor william smith is one of the best guys in the industry he treats the viewer with the best acting performance of his career as for randy travis he gives his best lee van cleef impression not bad in the film smith and travis make the movie as for the rest of the cast none of them really stand out ray did a great job directing this flick smith and travis were good i'd give this b western on a scale of one to being the best a seven
this movie is wonderful what separates it from other sci-fi is the fact that the alien has no features no face eyes anything yet it can't be killed i especially like the idea that this film doesn't take place over a few days it takes place in one night lasting supposedly past also scary that once the blob gets on you you can't get it off you're stuck in it as it dissolves your flesh and slowly devours your body my all time favorite sci-fi film and what is sometimes considered the quintessential one i can see why this rocketed steve mcqueen to stardom all this and a catchy theme song how can you go wrong
this belgian film directed by tom barman singer of the well-known group deus will not be favoured by everyone for the simple reason that there isn't a clear story or even a plot this movie just shows hours in a city antwerp and allows you to watch and truly enjoy the dialogues the directing the humorous the osteopath bruno and tragic paul garcin are several memorable scenes the windman on the beach the dance party at the end the kiss-fan windman visits the some other viewers didn't understand so beautiful and interesting in this movie they complain that this movie has no story etc but the atmosphere that keeps you watching and that will drag you into you didn't watch it yet be sure to listen carefully to the music the soundtrack is extraordinary just like tom barman and his group ssst mondje dicht hé tell anyone
my first fassbinder was a wonderful experience film and alternative cinema hall with uncomfortable seats public had to wait while filmrolls were changed were perfect were many cliches used in the film but fassbinder presented them so cleverly that i found them really amusing sound was also brilliant back being louder than seemed to be in right place and i loved the way how after-war-time was presented real
this is one of the best reunion specials ever with adam west and burt ward parodying themselves and having fun while doing it amazing the amount of effort that went into the detail particularly recapturing the feel of the era the batcave set wayne manor the costumes and the actors selected to play the younger versions of west ward burgess meredith cesar romero and frank gorshin this minutes is well worth your time and is a delight to all fans of the classic batman television series i note that clips from batman were from the movie and not the series itself probably because of legal restrictions hope the three seasons of the show are forthcoming on dvd
the documentary presents an original theory about guns germs and steel the series graphically portray several episodes strongly supporting the theory and defend the theory against common was deeply puzzled to find user comments complaining about lack of new information in these series they say documentary presents information which is taught in middle school indeed it does in fact i greatly enjoyed the original look at the information which i have known since middle school and the unexpected if you like knowing why things work if you have taken apart the telephone trying to determine how it worked if you have gone to the farm to see how farm works and how cows are milked you will enjoy this series a definite recommendation
i'm tired of people judging films on their historical accuracy a movie people the writers and directors are supposed to put their own spin into the story there are a number of movies out there that aren't entirely accurate with the wyatt earp gangs of new york geronimo an american legend the last of the fantastic films that are mildly inaccurate historically if you want to see a few great actors do what they do best then i suggest you see this film and don't worry about the accuracy of the facts just enjoy the quality of the film the storyline and one of the greatest actors of our time
a shame that this piece of work wasn't acknowledged as a piece of work it has everything a historical film must have a serious historical research outstanding performances of every actor involved and a discrete but great i saw the movie i knew it should be a prototype for every biographical movie
pierce brosnan will probably be the only thing familiar in richard new biopic the rest is new to international audiences canadian history and first nations owl is a light examination of how an man came to be adopted into the ojibway of northern ontario learning and preaching environmentalism decades before it became politically correct to do so the film contains a love story a moral message and a man tortured by his past that torture though is not always brought to life with the dramatic impact that it it is a film which holds its audience without any violence it pays deep respect to first nations and presents them in a dignified and non-stereotypical manner performance is somewhat stiff but i suspect just how lord attenborough wanted from a proud canadian
steven rea plays a forensic scientist thrust on the job in sovie russia in the very first hours of his job a body of a murdered girl is brought has his workers go back to look for evidence and they bring back five more starts the story of the hunt for one of the worst serial killers in modern day is a stark depressing dark movie that explores how the bureaucracy of the old soviet union indirectly contributed or caused the deaths of many of the killers also explores in donald character how the proper usage of bureaucracy in a communist govt can help achieve the ultimate goal of finding a monster a gripping movie not for all but for those who like a good detective story that will hold your interest this is definitely a must see on a scale of one to ten
this was a great movie that had a lot of under lying issues it dealt with issues of rascism and class but it also had a message of knowing yourself and taking responsibility for yourself this movie was very deep it gave the message of that you and only you can control your destiny it also showed that knowing yourself and being comfortable with who you are is the only way you will ever fit into society what others think of you is not important i believe this movie did a wonderful job of showing it the actors i think were able to convey each character wonderfully i just thought it was amazing how deep this movie really was at a just glancing look you wouldn't see how deep the movie is but on further look you see the underlining meaning of the movie
this movie started me on a nick cage kick it is a story full of twists and a movie of motives and moves of course dennis hopper was a ham but walsh and laura flyyn boyle are the perfect pair to catch the unsuspecting man who has fallen into their web everything about this movie is good cinematography story pace and most of all the end cage excels at what he does not to be an action hero but to be an everyman caught in the snares of life
this has to be the all time best computer animation classic even though most of the animations where experiments they have an artistic quality that has stood the test of time twelve years after release i have gone back to watch this video and found some inspiration for new types of computer graphics some of the techniques used in this video have never been full explored
look eva longoria and paul rudd in a movie about a dead girlfriend haunting the new girlfriend gabrielle from desperate housewives and the guy who wore sex panther cologne in anchorman if you are expecting a golden globe nominated movie then you need to rethink how you look at movies however if you are willing to suspend reality for minutes and want to watch a funny movie then you've come to the right place the characters are all funny they work together very well the real match up is paul rudd and lake bell as funny as he was on friends and she was funny and good looking all at the same time i went with my wife she enjoyed it and so did i
i went into this expecting not to like it i figured it would be terribly worthy and earnest and rather plodding and actually far better than that and i found myself really enjoying it i don't know too much about queen victoria beyond what most know married to albert who died young and she mourned him ever after seeing the circumstances she grew up under was fascinating in fact i found myself wishing i'd seen more of the story and i imagine we may see a sequel at some the film is stunning the sets and costumes are incredibly lavish without being too gaudy and over the top the acting is top notch from everybody a word it was great
if the screenwriter and director intended to open hearts with the movie as the musician wanted to do with his music they succeeded with me commonplace human situations became original personal and immediate so that i personally felt touched by each situation i believe i would credit the power of music combined with the point of view of the person writing the movie without spoiling i can say that i was very moved by the approach to living haven't actually cried out joy empathy just deep emotion in a very long time i would love to find a way to show it to others saw it at seattle international film festival
night of the twisters is a very good film that has a good cast which includes devon sawa amos crawley john schneider lori hallier laura bertram david ferry helen hughes jhene erwin alex lastewka thomas lastewka megan kitchen and graham mcpherson the acting by all of these actors is very good the special effects and thrills is really good and some of it is surprising the movie is filmed very good the music is good the film is quite interesting and the movie really keeps you going until the end this is a very good and thrilling film if you like devon sawa amos crawley john schneider lori hallier laura bertram david ferry helen hughes jhene erwin the rest of the cast in the film action mystery thrillers dramas and interesting films then i strongly recommend you to see this film today
a great film slow original deeply atmospheric dark and horrifying perfectly surreal like a compare it to david lynch inland empire blue velvet style maybe with mixed with a little bit of barton fink and naked lunch also a bit of jodorowsky y some night on earth angel heart and a bit of begotten pi it be wrong to mention tetsuo ladder the forbidden and salome that should form together at least the concept of a dark night nuit you're out for avantegardistic surrealistic cinema i am you're gonna like this one if you're expecting anything else like a movie full of action with some average plot try your luck with something words the plot is very very strange and unusual and probably the reason why most people who don't appreciate this film hate it
jim carrey and morgan freeman along with jennifer aniston combine to make one of the funniest movies so far this season may and a good improvement on past crazy and personally forgetable roles in past comedies with a slightly toned down carrey antics yet with just the zap and crackle of his old self carrey powerfully carries this movie to the height of laughter and also some dramatic tearfully somber moments elements of real acting abilities continue to show up in this movie this delightful summer entertainment hits most of the buttons including dramatic elements along with the goofy moments that fit perfectly with this script while still lacking in the superbly polished ensemble of bruce almightly deserves credit for being a great date movie along with a solid message and soft spiritual cynicism and parody that maintains its good-natured taste eight out of ten stars
i am shocked shocked and dismayed that the of you imdb users who voted before me have not given this film a rating of higher than a c if i could give fobh a i'd gladly do it this film ranks high atop the pantheon of modern comedy alongside half baked and mallrats as one of the most hilarious films of all time if you know about rap music you must see this if you know nothing about rap music learn something and then see this comparisons to spinal tap fail to appreciate the inspired genius of this unique film if you liked bob roberts you'll love this watch it and vote it a
this one took me by surprise because i had often been disappointed by adrian pasdar in the past but he caught the perfect balance in this performance avoiding both farce and pathos while delivering humour and real emotions the always-wonderful julie waters is terrific here and anyone who has not yet scene her in educating rita should rent it immediately film the rest of the supporting characters are well-played as well many marvelously eccentric without going over the top this one is fun
i haven't seen much german comedy but if this film is anything to go by i'm compelled to see more the simple but effective storyline takes two very different people on a trip from germany to italy after eva an unemployed mother of two discovers that her artist husband is having an affair with the wife of a wealthy lawyer i won't reveal anything further but what results is a very funny series of events with the perfect conclusion my interest in international cinema has expanded since i first saw this film i recommend it to anyone adult don't let the inclusion of the young children fool you into thinking a family film who love comedy even those unfamiliar with the language
amazing documentary saw it on original airdate and on dvd a few times in the last few years i was shocked that it wasn't even nominated for a best documentary oscar for the year it was released no other documentary even comes was on tv recently for the anniversary but i missed the added where are they now segment at the end except i did catch that tony now works for the hazmat seen criticism on documentary film-making from a few on this list i can't see how this could have been done any different they had less than months to assemble this and get it on the air the dvd contains more material and also surprised that according to the brother have had no projects in the four years since what have they been doing
this is just a great fun lovely film it captures the true essence of the decade and of the people and tells a beautiful love story of two sisters with two sailors though this film may only be in black and white it definitely doesn't count against it now in modern days the main basic purpose of the movie is timeless this movie features great acting beautiful song and dance numbers and great design work and film shots follow the fleet is also comical there are funny moments moments that will make you laugh but other moments where the acting just gets you so involved into the storyline its amazing how though this movie may be set in a certain decade how it can affect those today if you want to see something great check this out
this movie scared heck out of me when i was just a kid no citizen kane but it has its moments the arm ripping scene is good the plot is good even if characters aren't could have something to do with the acting put some top name people in the roles and then see what you get this was one of those shoot edit little there was and distribute in a couple of months type of movies this is classic low budget sci-fi and deserves it just due i rated it a based other films of this genre and age
well the movie isn't exactly i admit there are a few humorous lines but definitely nothing that is laugh-out-loud funny for example right before a steamy sex scene between eleniak and one of her male costars sh is handcuffed to the bedpost and he cannot remove her shirt before leaving the room to retrieve the key he tells her okay don't go humorous but not plot and acting are pretty erika eleniak definitely steals the show hot and sexy and there is a really steamy scene with her that one can't help but rewind and are also some other very sexy scenes with her and she has some very provocative stars i'd only give it three if not for erika eleniak
the rating is only a because a movie that could have used better acting and direction at least music however for the achievements of walt whitman it deserves a a previous poster calls the movie cheesy however i think a simple case of not seeing the forest for the trees the film makers were apparently more interested in getting the story out there than to have a hollywood shiny feature film and for this i applaud them the fact it is non-mainstream reflects the life of whitman as well this film is more documentary than for the sake of acting to be fascinated with a story such as this when you rarely hear of these types of stories that shape current day mental health is the most important thing i found it a highly enjoyable look at history
lapyuta in the sky more than any of hayao movies brings the joy of storytelling to the audience it is the kind of movie that makes one feel like a kid again just magical a crime that it took this long for it to be released in the states but now that here check it out and stick with the original language the dub changed my impressions of the characters somewhat which is something that should be avoided at all costs in a translation of a movie book give it a
rudy does it again with this hot off the streets follow up to dolemite this entry is filled with the requisite rudy ray moore raunch humor and martial arts rudy eludes a crazy red-neck sheriff in this movie that also features an infamous scene where rudy dives down a steep hill see it for laughs and for a brain-blasting hit of blaxploitation magic
i really like this movie because in australia chinese movies like these never get shown during prime time i must say this is one of the best serious movies ever which outlines the difference between the hong kong people and mainland chinese it really shows that discomfort between the two but can only get better as hk are learning mandarin it also showed me how in mainland china the indie rock scene exists and that chinese people do know how to strum the guitar and get the house funking whoever said china isn't ready for rock music daniel wu is absolutely superb with his clean and crisp voice honest acting and a total chick magnet i recommend this movie to those who don't know much about asian people to cleanse themselves from the typical western stereotypes and people who just love cinema like myself check it out
normally i don't like series at all they're all to predictable and they tend to become boring and dull very series however are well played the story follows through all episodes and even if you miss one the story will still be catching your episodes are all filmed on a hospital and takes you further and further in to the mysteries of dark and old secrets that lies just beneath the surface of the mighty hospital
in one of her first movies romy schneider shines as young queen victoria of britain as she is suddenly put into the throne at the age of learns to govern despite the machinations of the politicians and eventually romances and marries prince albert of saxony kitschy and campy surprisingly faithful to the real events this romantic piece is irresistible seeing this movie about british royals spoken in german adds to its quaint charm on that front one wonders why an austrian movie was made about an english queen but then one remembers that in austria was still under occupation by allied troops including british ones maybe this was one of the reasons for the existence of this film
pure orson welles genius makes this one of the greatest of movies welles is drawn into a murder conspiracy only to be set up as the fall guy which is what he refers to with the sarcastic comment big dummy that i am plot is so complex that i still don't know whether the victim knew that his life was about to be lost the shootout scene in the carnival hall of mirrors is one of the most amazing ever filmed that scene alone is worth the price of admission this is the only time that rita hayworth ever played a complex yet believable character no one but welles would have had the nerve to cut her hair and dye it brassy blond no one should miss this picture
full house was and still is a great show a good show for people of all ages and is also a good family show there really aren't any shows like it anymore the kids are very cute and even though a bit cheesy still good especially for anyone who watched it when they were a kid i would love to see the cast interviewed now anyone that would like to see interviews of the cast kind of like a where are they now type thing for the special features of the dvd should go to the petition spot website and sign a petition titled full house reunion on dvd as there is a petition for this in hopes that the cast may want to do it yay for full house
this movie has very good acting by virtually all the cast a gripping story with a chilling ending great music and excellent visuals without significant special effects it is interesting to note though that like so much science fiction its predictions for the future don't appear likely to come to pass as early as depicted not to say we're out of the woods yet but is now obviously too soon to be in this condition it shares this failing with a fairly illustrious list of science fiction classics a space odyssey its space station with our international space station and isaac i robot brains were to have been invented in the
you know our spirit is based on that revolution asleep i can explain i think well until that happen on april our freedom was limited we didn't had liberty of speech but when we got it at the revolution it seems that portuguese people lost his opinion we don't use our liberty of speech all a consequence of the revolution i think clear about the movie i think that it has a few mistakes on some acting but by the way i use to watch on portuguese movies quite good i like it very much
this film deals with the atrocity in derry years ago which is commonly known as bloody film is well researched acted and directed it is as close to the truth as we will get until the outcome of the saville enquiry the film puts the atrocity into context of the time it also shows the savagery of the soldiers on the day of the atrocity the disgraceful white-wash that was the widgery tribunal is also dealt this is an excellent drama which is moving and shocking when the saville report comes out watch this film again to see how close to the truth it is
cracking good yarn with all the actors giving great value michael curtiz at his best lots of nice twists and turns and probably the best of the philo vance series william powell looks wonderfully relaxed and at his debonair best a forerunner to the thin man series recommend to everyone did you figure it all out
this is a great short i think every voice is done by jason steele can only just barely tell if you've heard his normal voice though so don't worry about them sounding the same they don't its about minutes the spatula is fighting the war against spoons and he meets some weird people in fact everyone he knows seem pretty crazy general peterson we have to get you to a medical unit no i'm not gonna make it edward dont talk like that i'm sure you'll be fine im a goner edward and you know it before i yes can i just have one kiss umm no come on just one small peck on the lips im walking away now gonna be movie pretty soon the date for that is in september but its probably gonna get pushed back
this movie is about development people growing and people fading people surprising and people disappointing it has it all and more there is hope frustration injustice justice love and hate it is truly a classic drama that has fantastic performances from the whole cast but especially whoopi goldberg in her debut movie made me feel very human and proud of it and i suggest that this movie should be mandatory each saturday in all prisons in the world it touches your compassion rating of i admit it i shed a tear of joy during the final scene
yes i have a copy of it on vhs uncut in great condition that i transfered to dvd and if anyone one wants to bring back the memories of a christmas classic please emil me at searched everywhere and i found nothing on this and i thought that i cant be the only one on this planet that has this classic on tape there has to be other people and if they do i fit in with them being that very very few that has this classic so i consider myself lucky and i have all of the muppets christmas except one that john denver did with the muppets again i thinks its called a smokey mountain holiday im not to sure but its close
generally i like something light and fun so this film shouldn't have appealed to me but it grabbed me from the start the story of a choices and challenges seem obvious but it raises the question over and over what if it was my family my choice i cried and laughed when they did because i really felt what the people involved felt it was in places difficult to watch but more difficult to turn away the story is true and life is sometimes difficult to watch it shows what film-makers can do without sex violence or special effects a good story is a good story all by itself the best and most unpredictable stories are all true ones like real life you really don't know what'll happen next or why people do the things that they do
sergeant ryker is accused of being a traitor during the korean war a hanging offense a long drawn out court-marshal ensues during which time the sgt must remain in a military jail after much investigation the defense attorney attempts to exonerate the doomed non-com with an eleventh hour ploy very good picture
i barely remember this show a little but i remembered it was great my eldest brother reminded me about the show recently and i had seen an advertisement for the set coming out the network again screwed up in pulling this from the air so that they could put what else in place it should have gone at least seasons why not right i think sometimes that the network executives think they are the gods of the entertainment world but they mis-guess and flat out miss good show placement from time to time let it be said that they have a lot more flops than hits this was one of the poor decisions to cut from the line-up anyhow i am getting this for my collection
i will never forget this film or the events that lead up to jonestown in guyana it just seems so tragic but needs to be told powers boothe give a commanding performance as the leader rev jim jones from obscurity until total madness it would have won him an academy award easily if it was released in the movie theaters it is the kind of mini-series you won't forget you won't forget the images of the brutality control and obsessiveness of leader his rise and fall and the threat from the outside world to destroy what he considered to be paradise the mass suicide is horrifying almost unreal to imagination as to why so many people went willingly or resisted jones orders they don't make mini series like these anymore where we're left with out mouths open and hungry to know what happened to the others
i was amazed at the improvements made in an animated film if you sit close to the screen you will see the detail in the grass and surface structures the detail colors and shading are at least an order of magnitude better than toy story how they were able to pull off the shading i will never know i do hope that pixar will provide a documentary on how the film was produced so i can find out how all this was accomplished based on this film i think animated films of the future will be judged on the basis of this film
how to lose friends alienate people is a superb film a hilarious film from start to end a lovely entertainer enjoyed it thumps up jason is fantastic a treat to watch him from start to end jeff bridges is excellent as the boss a legend megan fox looks amazingly hot and deliver a good performance but dude so hot man anderson is delightful she doesn't look old at all still hot indeed kristan dunst looks lovely and does a pretty good job others are also pretty to lose friends alienate people is a excellent entertainer don't miss this flick
holes is a wonderful film to see it has good messages in in such as be a good friend never give up etc i highly recommend it to anyone i still say the book is better than the movie but the movie gives the book a run for its money also khleo thomas plays zero that really adds to it lol
i believe a lot of people down rated the movie not because of the lack of quality but it did not follow the standard hollywood formula some of the conflicts are not resolved the ending is just a little too real for others but the journey the rich characters and long list of supporters provide is both thought provoking and very entertaining even the cinematography is excellent given the urban setting the directing also is excellent and is a in my book this movie will take you places the normal and expected hollywood script will not they took some risks and did a few things different i think it worked well i am purposely trying to avoid any direct references to the movie because seeing it for yourself is the best answer not accepting someone interpretation
the movie wasn't all that great the book is better but the movie wasn't all that bad either it was interesting to say the least the plot had enough suspense to keep me watching although i wouldn't say i was actually interested in the movie itself janine turner and antonio sabato jr are both gorgeous enough to keep you watching they have a few cute that should appeal to the overall i'd give the movie a or it wasn't bad just a little lacking plot wise
i saw this movie a few months ago on cable and it was fantastic william h macy is one of my favorite actors and his performance was just amazing he makes you care for his character even when he is clearly doing the wrong thing and neve campbell gives a performance that is with out a doubt the best performance i have seen by an actress this year she is fantastic as a wild young woman who is wise beyond her sutherland is just plain creepy as father and john ritter is fine as a shrink stuck in the middle of everything that is wish that this was in the theater because i feel that a movie that should be view by a wider audience a shame because a hell of allot better that most of the new movies coming into the theater
i think that the movie was kind of weird in the opening scene a person is killed for no reason he doesn't get mentioned again the special effects could have also be better but i enjoyed watching an older horror movie it isn't the best example of a classic horror movie but it still was an alright movie i give it about a out of of the scale
it has been years since original run i would have hoped by now some marketing wizard would have promoted a live actor version of this classic by now or at least sought to re-release the original episodes i can't fathom why the sci-fi or cartoon network haven't snapped this up galaxy rangers actually had well thought out plots and even better animation was above average quality for time and excellent when compared to the talking slide show japanese animation of today it predated the heavy toon-toy tie in market this may have sealed doom too i would willingly spend cash on a dvd of gr if available
matthau and lemmon are at their very best in this one everyone else in the movie are also great the dialogue is excellent and very very witty and the scene where character attempts to clear out his sinuses in a restaurant have me rolling on the floor with laughter every time i see it anyone who happened to see the not so great sequel should not be turned away from the original i recommend this wonderful movie to everyone i just love it and the fact the jack lemmon plays his character so straight forward with tragic overtones only adds to the hilariousness in my opinion these two great guys made a string of movies together but this one is the best no doubt
thank the lord for martin scorsese and his love of the is the perfect introduction into the mind of the most talented american artist working in cinema today and i couldn't recommend it more i was enthralled through the whole thing and you will be too just relax and let him take you on a ride through his world you'll love it
although at one point i thought this was going to turn into the graduate i have to say that the mother does an excellent job of explaining the sexual desires of an older so glad this is a british film because hollywood never would have done it and even if they had they would have ruined it by not taking the time to develop the story is revealed slowly and realistically the acting is superb the characters are believably flawed and the dialogue is sensitive i tried many times to predict what was going to happen and i was always wrong so i was very intrigued by the highly recommend this movie and i must confess i'll forever look at my mom in a different light
if you like deep purple you will enjoy in this excellent movie with stephen rea in main role the story is about the most famous rock group back there in strange fruits and they decided to play together again but of course there is going to be lots of problem during theirs concerts jimmy nail and bill nighy are great and song the flame still burns is perfect you have to watch it
maybe i'm biased to foxes fox stories and all but i thought this was wonderfully really enjoyed that it was shown when lily wasn't comfortable such as the fire and the room not to spoil too much here i think important for kids to see and try to reading a few others comments i'm a bit confused one says that at the end the mother and her son appear as been the one telling her son about her story the movie i saw did not have the mother or son at the end merely a painting of a girl with a fox can someone enlighten me on that anyway i really enjoyed this movie although some scenes can be a bit slow which might be difficult for high energy kids to sit through still worth it if they can sit still
one of my favorite twilight zone episodes and the next day we were in the supermarket at hollywood blvd and la brea my father and i and guess who was coming toward us in the aisle barney phillips but no hat on at least i don't think he had a hat asked him about his third eye and he said something like he left it at home and everybody he met that day had asked him about friendly guy we used to see all kinds of character actors in la in those i was a teenager and it took a long time for me to get over the three hands on the other alien frisch o'neill native and resident to
kudos to director and cast for such a realistic film the grittiness lack of glamor and desperation drew me into the film and kept me there i was truly impressed by how dates and information were relayed within the film ie newspapers letters etc it kept the film moving at such a fast pace i didn't feel the urge to fast forward once personally i thought all the principles did a tremendous was great to see bosworth and kudrow in such difficult roles it made me want to cry at times val kilmer didn't surprise performances of this nature usually leave me in awe overall this is a brilliant film not to be missed
although the beginning of the movie in new york takes too long the movie is a must see for people who like this genre when hannah goes to berlin to visit the older woman who helped her mother during the war the movie gets much much movie is a bit like the pianist can not really be compared
john thaw is a an excellent actor i have to admit that i was impressed by his range in the role of a crusty old curmudgeon who reluctantly agrees to take in an evacuee from the streets of london time being said the film is also excellent a very moving story with a satisfying ending some of the characters are a little underdeveloped school teacher in particular but none of them are essential to the plot basically the story is about the old man and the boy and the film needs little else
jim carrey shines in this beautiful movie this is now one of my favorite movies i read all about the making and i thought it was incredible how the did it i can't wait till this comes out on dvd i saw this in theaters so many times i can't even count how times i've seen it
before this the flawed slaughterhouse five was the best but this screen adaptation of mother night is very true to the book and keeps the comedy mystery and tragedy intent thankfully it wasn't hollywood-ized or idiotized a la the movie of breakfast of champions another good thing about this movie is that you don't have to be familiar with the book to follow it i think you do for slaughterhouse five probably true of breakfast of champions also but they did such a bad job of that you're better off just reading the book and not seeing the movie nick nolte did an excellent job in this film
not one of your harder-hitting stories and a real strength of this film there are at least two relationships in which less confident writers would have added some all-too predictable romantic tension they not only spare the audience this but throw in some surprises at the same time there are a few disney-ish moments particularly near the end but they are manageable overall it was worth the rental and it was good relaxed if you get the dvd watch the segment where the director teaches you how to make aloo gobi we followed her directions and it was brilliant next time we will make it the day before we plan to eat it because this is one dish that definitely gets better with a full night in the fridge to let the spices out
this is a very light headed comedy about a wonderful family that has a son called pecker because he use to peck at his food pecker loves to take all kinds of pictures of the people in a small suburb of baltimore md and manages to get the attention of a group of photo art lovers from new york city pecker has a cute sister who goes simply nuts over sugar and is actually an addict taking spoonfuls of sugar from a bag there are scenes of men showing off the lumps in their with grinding movements and gals doing pretty much the same it is rather hard to keep your mind out of the gutter with this film but who cares it is only a film to give you a few laughs at a simple picture made in
this game ranks above all so far i had the honor of playing mine on so the graphics were really good the voice acting was above standard the difficulty level is just right wesker has to be the best characters in the re series in my opinion the story amazed me and took many different twist that i wasn't expecting the only rating this game deserves is great
a struggling actor finds the best way to break into hollywood is to start knocking off the competition but what makes break a leg a real gem is the sardonic look into the existence of the struggling not so la actor it brings us into that world with effortless irony and wit also got a polished look and very adept direction under monika mitchell break a leg is one of those rare independent films that doesn't compromise its production values at any level the writing is tight the dialogue first rate cassini is an actor and the role really shows off his talents the climactic scene between him and rene garcia is an instant classic and may go down as one of the funniest hollywood scenes of all time i saw it at an advanced screening and everyone in the audience laughed uncontrollably and raved about it afterwards
mr blandings builds his dream house may be the best frank sturges movie neither man ever made if you love bringing up baby the philadelpia story the thin man i was a male war bride or a wonderful life movies made with wit taste and and the occasional tongue firmly panted in cheek check this one out post wwii life is simply and idyllically is at the absolute top of his form playing the city mouse venturing into the life of a country squire loy is adorable as his pre-now wife the cast of supporting characters compares to you can't take it with you and contains an early bit by future tarzan lex barker art direction and editing are way above movie never stoops to the low-rent by-the-numbers venal slapstick of the later adaptation the money pit
this movie is a true reflection of the australian resourcefulness that has been required to make this country what it is over the last years not pompous like the british not gung-ho like the americans if either of those countries had attempted what this crew did it would have failed dismally either due to ignorance on the british part or too much faith in superior firepower on the american side true australians non-imports are the only ones who can excel in modern military conflicts because they have had to improvise most of their adult lives just look at examples like gallipoli paschendale tobruk new guinea and vietnam
this movie is definitely on the list of my top favorites the voices for the animals are wonderful sally field and michael j fox are both brilliant as the sassy feline and the young inexperienced pooch but the real standout is don ameche as the old faithful golden retriever this movie is a great family movie because it can be appreciated and loved by children as well as adults humorous and suspenseful and guaranteed to make every animal lover cry tears
i just saw this movie on lost my dad when i was young and this movie surely did touch can feel the lost that the little girl desi feeling of wanting to see her father to talk to at least given the chance to say i'm so touched with the letter that was wrote back to that her father read her letter and sent it back to someone to reply her and buy her a present because there isn't a shop in just lets me feel that miracles do exist
this movie is just plain silly almost every scene has some bit of humor running gags slapstick and great jokes the acting isn't that great and the plot is cliche but the jokes more than make up for that if you have a chance to see this movie i recommend that you do
this movie was good for time if you like eddie murpy this is a must have to add to your collection eddie was young and funny with his haircut charlotte lewis costar is hot this was one of her first movies and she was not bad the graphics were good for the a lot of the actors went on to do other good movies you should check them out through imdb other must have from eddie is coming to america and hours another actor victor wong has a small part in this movie check out some of his older movies like big trouble in little china if you liked the action movies from the this is your movie

fantastic documentary of this early century geography of iraq was powerful watch this and tell me if cecil b demille didn't take notes before making his the ten commandments merian c cooper the photographer later created cinerama an idea that probably hatched while filming the remarkable landscapes in this film fans of werner herzog will find this film to be a treasure with heartbreaking tales of struggle complimented by the land around them never has the human capacity to endure been so evident the fact that this was made when it was shows not only the will of the subjects but of the filmmakers themselves
i saw the german version of the movie in german television and i was really amazed i generally like to see documentaries but i can't remember to have seen one that is better than earth i knew some of the scenes from youtube videos that i found by random browsing i also remember to have seen parts of the film on multimedia stores running on the displayed high definition tvs after seeing the movie obvious to me why the footage is so popular among youtube users and multimedia retail managers just so awesome and spectacular that you can't help but stare on the screen no matter if you're generally interested in nature documentaries or hesitating a out of for sure there are more thrilling movies but in regard of documentaries earth is definitely one of the best of genre
kate beckinsale steals the show bravo too bad knightly ins't as good looking as jeremy northam mark strong did a fabulous job bernard hepton was perfect as emmas father i love the end scene is an addition to the novel-but well written when the harvest is in and knightly dines with his workers and high society friends emma must show that she accepts this now she is a changed woman that is too much too quick but ok i'll buy into it samantha bond plays ex-governess and confidant she is wonderful just as i would have imagined her i believe that when the uk does a jane austen its the best american versions of english literature are done for money and not for quality see this one
in budapest margaret sullavan klara novak gets a job as clerk in a gift shop there she bickers with co-worker james stewart alfred kralik the two don't get along on the job because each has fallen in love with a unseen pen pal watching ernst lubitsch direct these stars through the inevitable is predictably satisfying better is a sub-plot involving shop owner frank morgan hugo matuschek who suspects his wife is having an affair hiring a private detective mr morgan confirms his wife of years is having sex with one of his younger employees morgan painfully realizing she just didn't want to grow old with me and the supporting characters are what keeps this film from getting the shop around the corner ernst lubitsch james stewart margaret sullavan frank morgan joseph schildkraut
hey people up me man the one and only mike sonny sakura killer kelly you know you can't really write a review on the script of sakura cause there we didn't have one as far as i know the story was just made up as we went along i had the best time of my life making that film and got so much stank that i ran out of times so glad that you all enjoyed the film i really didn't get to do the fights that i had envisioned every time i set up some moves the fight director kept changing them still i had a blast and met some really great people especially the purple female ninja who has seem to fall of the film-making scene
just to mention one more thing about gentleman jim i agree with all the assessments that make this among errol greatest outings in a career of great outings i would think this role playing boxer jim corbett is more like his real personality than the swashbucklers he was typecast as flynn seemed like a party animal from his memoirs and was one guy whose real life was more exciting than his screen life the extra thing i wanted to point out is notice the great montages transitions and still inserts that punctuate the film although the director was raoul walsh a frequent collaborator with flynn with cinematographer sid hickox the montages were made up by an up and coming editor named don siegel i never knew siegel went that far back but listed right in the credits he would go on to a great career as action director himself
these two stars are the only iconic i know that got a good tv series so movies robocop tv series seasons about episodes robocop tv series season about extra films vs jason freddy vs ghostbusters robocop extra films prime directives dark justice meltdown crach burn upcoming film robocop upcoming had more screen time well they've both had movies tv series and upcoming film but freddy wins it thanks to his extra films being a fan film tv this is a comment for the series between nightmares anoes the series robocop the series i would personally choose robocop
when i saw it for the first time i was really director made such a mysterious atmosphere especially in the end through all the story spectators can expect that richard will really kill thomas or he will do it main point was not conflict and mature one prayed himself to save the younger who has the whole life to is amazing every time i watch it i course it is pretty violent like every action movie but i think it is acceptable thanks a lot louis liosa and tom berenger amazing advice everyone to see am sure people wont regret and will really have a good time
dark my sweet is a strange mix of sensuality and dullness the film runs slow very slow but takes a rythm to tell a story about murder and passion jason patric never ever was so sexy and powerful man gives a true performance and rachel ward is all but sexual tension the pshycological heat the footsteps of the past the flashback scenes the weirdness of the character all becomes a sexy mystery i recommend this one cause is the more sexy dull movie that i ever seen check the love making scene particulary sexy
this movie is a very relaxed romantic-comedy which is thoroughly enjoyable meg ryan does a very good job as the genius niece of albert einstein though she does believe in her own skills tim robbins does an equally good job as the mechanic who falls in love with her when she comes into his shop with her fiancé after her car stuffs up i loved walter matthau as the one and only albert einstein this movie just has a very relaxing feel to it while still keeping some sort of seriousness to it that is actually possible it happens personally found this movie extremely entertaining especially the old scientists i thought they were fab and hilarious this movie seems to have been underestimated beyond comprehension if you have a cheeky sense of humour this is the movie for you
this is just one more example of the absolute genius of gene wilder he wrote and starred in this terrific mystery no one could have done it better the suspense was palpable throughout i wish mr wilder would grace us with another of these i have enjoyed everything i have ever seen mr wilder in but i had no idea how truly talented he was until i saw murder in a small town and this follow-on he truly has a firm grasp on what audiences want and how to deliver it in his writing and of course in his brilliant acting his subtle wit comes through in spades i would recommend this movie to anyone who likes mysteries gene film work his star just gets brighter and brighter
this movie surprised me it had good one-liners and laughs a nonstop action-packed storyline with tons of gun action and explosions this movie surprisingly had a lot of good twists and turns the plot is solid despite what others may think it kept my interest the whole time right up till the very end in conclusion this is a great way for an action movie buff to spend time on
i am obsessed the story is amazing and the show is highly addictive but i love it i am on season disc and i tell you that i am too attached to the characters now for anything bad to happen to them would seriously affect my vote for the show and michael is on my list now kidding i am so happy to see there is a season because i was too afraid to go onto disc thinking that it would be ending i can't wait to see the rest now thanks to the actors of enjoy watching tv again before lost i surfed through every channel going to bed sad because of my disappointment in television but i have to say that lost is my kind of entertainment
ever since i remember i have loved airplanes and flying i am now in college with a private license and looking to become a commercial i could never remember why i was so obsessed with the subject until i came across my old tail spin tapes in my basement at home and it hit me this was it my parents bought every single tape they had and this was the only show i would watch as a kid i had the theme memorized as i grew up and i can still re-cite it today it is absolutely amazing and i plan on buying the soon it really is great for children and adults and is absolutely timeless i cannot get enough of this show
i appreciate movies like this smart and well-crafted entertaining absorbing well-acted and nicely directed nobody even pacino is chewing the trying to stand out one of the most effective moments pulling over at his beloved off ramp is chilling precisely because of its as good as say quiz show city hall is of a similar cloth engaging the mind as well as eye ear and heart why such well-hewn entertainment flops at the box office is know pacino does chew it up in one particular scene but precisely because required great scene too
shakespeare behind bars was the most surprising and delightful film i've seen all year about a prison program somewhere in california if i recall correctly where the inmates have rehearsed and performed a different shakespeare play every year for the past years the film follows their production of the tempest from casting through performance and in the process we learn some pretty amazing things about these men who are all in for the most serious of crimes truth is indeed stranger than fiction if anyone tried to adapt this story into a fiction film the audience would never buy it but knowing that real makes it breathtaking to watch literally i gasped out loud when i learned of one particularly gifted crime like some loopy episode of oz and all the more entertaining because the characters and their bizarre stories are real
i have to vote this out of in the rare chance that she happens to see this review takes pity on me whisks me to hollywood and involves me in her world but in all seriousness it was good first episode is obviously finding feet but got that silverman weirdness running all the way through it not a laugh out loud sort of comedy but good thing too much has a laughter-track to it and this wouldn't be right with cues when to laugh to the audience to hear their inner jester laughing at the absurdness of it all i can easily see this as being the bizarro drew carey show with weird characters and incredibly strong central character well worth a watch look forward to the following episodes a very good chance from the usual comedy out there sarah call me
i have a old and got really tired of watching care bears all the time rooney is a great dancer who cares if he is gay this guy must have been a cheerleader or barney cant get the songs out of my have lines of text so i must about when the say all the canadian stuff like ooout aboooot whacky is rhyming too much she must be knock there dee dee super driver bob cannot dance take lessons from rooney
micro-phonies is a classic stooge short the guys are inept repairmen working at a radio station and during some horsing around in a broadcast booth perfect mimic of a recording of voices of spring is mistaken for the real thing leading to a radio contract and a zany musical party the mock rendition of the quintet from lucia de l'amamore is especially entertaining no doubt this is essential viewing for stooge the evidence of failing health is visible in his face and voice his performance is amazing and it is probably the last glimpse of the old curly some fans think that a bird in the hand is the last great curly short but his coarse voice and slow movement are just too difficult to watch
this is the best of the films that rainer werner fassbinder made his most successful at least he was one of the leading directors in the new germany after schygulla was magnificent as the cold calculating maria bruan who lost her husband to the war found him after she took an american soldier as a lover lost him again after he went to jail for her and found him agin at the end her day and a half marriage before he disappeared was longer than their time together at the is life things come and go and you do the best you can you can give up or adjust you way of thinking to survive even though maria adjusted her thinking and did what she had to do she never stopped loving hermann which makes the end such a drama
all about mitzi i loved her in this and didn't she look fantastic i love these lifetime sunday afternoon popcorn movies this is like one of those nailbiters where they always go to commercial at the most annoying times the richard character was completely creepy i've dated guys like that well not totally like that lol i wish zack hadn't have gotten killed he was a cutie and very easy on the eyes i love these stalker type stories it always makes me get up and make sure my doors are locked my husband doesn't usually like these types of movies but actually sat through the entire thing with me and actually enjoyed it i can't wait to see what mitzi does next
wes craven has been created a most successful killer-thriller movies of all time after watching movies you will find your new fears people don't know which wes thriller movie is the best because they all this movie lisa is terrorize by fellow-traveler he coercible her to kill and if she don't do this jack will kill her father lisa is in the huge mess because whatever she choose she will was unreal rachel mcadams and cillian murphy acted unbelievable good the emotions was in right choose idea and script of this movie is great it reminds a scream but he definitely better than both screams sequels what can i say this is the best killer-thriller movie in century yet
wow this was a movie was completely captivating i could not believe that i started awake so late to watch it but it came on late ounce i started watching i couldn't stop it had a full range of very good cast members wow even eartha kitt and ruby dee forrest whittaker and james earl jones and many more well known actors and actresses this was more than a glimpse into history it was eye opening into another part of society that people don't know of and may even be embarrassed to talk about i've never heard of a book or movie about this before and this is something that black history never addresses only looks down on because they were privleged and mixed race i highly recommend this movie
an ok movie about downs syndrome a mother has twins one is very sick the other is good but he has downs the mother does not think she can raise him so she gives him to some people who have kids have downs the mom does not like this she thinks he should be with his family i agree too so they take it to court the family gets broken up the grandparents lose it never really says if the mom daughter makeup i think this good but the plot is familiar still good has a few unintentional laughs
tenchu aka directed by hideo gosha starring shintaro katsu and tetsuya nakadei belongs with goyokin hara kiri rebellion to the best chambara movies the story about shintaro katsu plays okada izo working for nakadei who wants to become the daymio okada being the cleaner for nakadei is being treated like a dog and after quite a while he realises what he realy is to there is so much more in this movie every fan of japanese cinema should have seen it means heavens punishment
words are seriously not enough convey the emotional power of this film one of the most wrenching you'll ever see yet the ending is one of the most loving tender and emotionally fulfilling you could hope for every actor in every role is terrific especially a wise and understated jamie lee curtis a tightly wound and anguished ray liotta and a heart-stopping turn from tom hulce that should have had him up for every award in the book the pick for best actor in danny alternate oscars the last half hour borders on melodrama but the film earns every one of its unless you're made of stone there will be plenty of them
my fondness for chris rock varies with his hated him after lethal weapon i hated everyone in that movie after like him when he is himself and not holding in dogma well this is his best expecting this to be that my arse off the whole time chris rock delivers a sweet wonderful story backed by some of the funniest comedy i've seen in quite some time loved it
this movie is utterly hilarious its cast clicks immediately with frame one and takes us on a wonderful ride through spoofing gangster films the conflict of brother vs brother appears when brother becomes a do-gooder however the best character is crimelord rival the overly accented moroni as johnny says that man should be arrested for butchering the english it out on video worth a look
if john thaw had never played morse kavanagh or starred in the sweeney and other productions he'd be remembered for this wonderfully unforgettable performance in goodnight mr supported by an equally tremendous performance by his co-star nick robinson in his first role and an unobtrusive cast this adaptation of michelle charming novel is a fitting memorial to his i read this story of an old widowed norfolk countryman having to accommodate a young boy from london before and during the blitz i found a rather obvious time-line error in it and credit must go to the makers of this film for rectifying this error they also must be applauded for not over-sentimentalising the tale and preventing what could have been turned quite easily into a mushy you keep a cd or video library then this feel-good made for tv movie is an absolute must inclusion
though i saw this movie years ago its impact has never left me stephen depiction of an invetigator is deep and moving his anguish at not being able to stop the deaths is palpable everyone in the cast is amazing from sutherland who tries to accommodate him and provide ways for the police to coordinate their efforts to the troubled citizen x each day when we are bombarded with stories of mass murderers i think of this film and the exhausting work the people do who try to find the killers
chances are uses that marvelous song by the same name throughout the film robert downey jr is excellent in this movie his extra large eyes and wonderfully variable facial expressions are part of expertise in acting as different people in diverse films compare robert downey jr in chaplin you will enjoy chances are i did
i did not expect the performances of gackt and hyde to be as well done as they were nor did i expect them to be cast in such an artistic well-developed movie with enough plot to keep you interested and enough diversity to make it original this movie was an unexpected masterpiece for me and i'll be on the lookout for the next movie like it i especially like the fact that it is a vampire movie but it wasn't a cheesy vampire flick nor did it over embellish that fact the characters all had human traits the way it shows the growth of the characters was incredibly tasteful and it makes you actually feel sorry for them throughout their lives i give this movie two thumbs so far up definitely the best movie i have seen in the past five years
i watched this movie by chance get curious by the trailer on tv i like when i discover movies like this little tender stories about ordinary people even if the end is tragic the man in the moon has some funny moments especially in the first characterization of dani with her innocent and pure love affair with court really a beautiful moving love story with high points the performance of reese witherspoon who maintained her promises in the world of cinema the beautiful cinematography by the old lion freddie francis and the fantastic score by james newton howard which is really the soul of the movie his themes deserved an oscar nomination are so intimate and lyric that it seems they had transformed the screenplay in music
george lopez never caught my interest in his stand up comedy and he still doesn't but this show is a work of art not ever show where the jokes keep you laughing every time you remember it jokes that re memorable at that this show just has an upbeat look to it and the characters range from an old short drunk to an dyslexic teenager i don't know who writes this show but that person does a great job if they had just continued the show i'm sure that it would get a positive response from the critics of this great country if you are looking for a good traditional comedy then george lopez is the show for you the one bad thing is the title george lopez really imagine the fresh prince of bel-air being will smith c'mon man but otherwise this show is genius
i have never observed four hours pass quite so quickly as when i saw this film this film restores the power and art to hamlet that it was always meant to have even those oh-so famous speeches are done in new and inventive ways and the cast is incredible brannagh the brightest star it is his charisma power and command of the role that defines the movie making it a full and complete version fills so many holes and allows for new appreciation of the tragedy despite the length where one would expect the dark gloomy cliched castle we are treated to a sumptuous feast for the eyes the only gloom comes from hamlet himself as it should well worth your time all four hours of it
deathtrap gives you a twist at every turn every single turn in fact its biggest problem is that there are so many twists that you never really get oriented in the film and it often doesn't make any sense although they do usually catch you by surprise the story is very good except for the fact that it has so many twists the screenplay is very good with great dialogue and characters but you can't catch all the development because of the twists the performances particularly by caine are amazing the direction is very good sidney lumet can direct the visual effects are fair but than again most are actually in a play and are fake twists way to much but still works and is worth watching
i found this movie really funny because you have a youthful black comedian rock who dies and is sent back to earth in a white mans body he doesn't realize that his behavior should change and continues to act as he had before he listens to rap music sings along and plays the stereotypical part of an urban black man the real humor in this movie was watching the trouble that this behavior gets him into with the black community
after seeing the terrible terrible terrible batman dead end i knew i had to see this as soon as i heard about play to view the trailer i thought i was in for another hideous short from what so-far looked like another bad wannabe film-maker trying to bring new depth to an existing character but was instead greeted with a greatly put together trailer for a movie that sadly doesn't exist as i would love to see a finished movie even if it was only minutes finest makes up for batman dead end and then look forward to the next short
at first i thought the ring would be a more than normal movie with ordinary plot how surprised was i of course the plot is simple one girl is in love with two men but hitchcock brings it to us on a silver platter with laughter and fear with compassion and anguish the way he depicts the popular crowds of the fair the strength of the attraction of the girl to both men the tragic elements that come together with techniques that open the mind to most of his greatest by northwest the rope etc the master did it great even before his thirties
when this first came out months after the tragedy i didn't want to see it i didn't want to open old wounds i regretted it now i have seen the movie thank god i did it shows you the bravery of all the fdny and nypd i salute you it offered me closure i can now move on with my life
i enjoyed the innocence of this film and how the characters had to deal with the reality of having a powerful animal in their midst the gorilla looks just terrific and the eyes were especially lifelike even a little scary at times and should have children slightly frightened without going over the top rene russo plays her role wonderfully feminine usually these type of hollywood films that take place in the past feel the need to create a straw-man villain but the only adversary is the gorilla an interesting look at how close some animals are to humans how they feel the same emotions we do and yet how we really can't treat them just like people because they aren't not many films venture into this territory and worth seeing if you want to contemplate the human-animal similarity
this movie has great fight scenes now its true that the acting is a little rough but if i wanted to see a movie based on acting skills i would watch a cheesy movie like american beauty but if you want to see a movie with true martial arts in it and with amazing stunts without the use of wires and flying threw the air like so many movies around now which are over killing the matrix then watch this now true the two main stars in the show where in the kid show the power rangers and another cast member of that show has a bit part in this movie but hey the fight scenes are enough to make jet li his pants and the stunts are worthy enough for jackie chan to sit threw and admire
this movie is the best horror movie love how stanley just dumps the women into the have been a fan of judd work for many years and he blew me away its a blend of horror and drama and romance not so much comedy his evil yet charming look captured me right then and there that look in his eyes i will never forget something about him i cant describe
i have seen the short movie a few years ago after that i watch all sequels the first one is really not the best but the most popular one i've already watch the making of guinea pig really great what these guys did also the sequels are excellent in the special effects take your chance to watch it
i'm a writer working at home and diagnosis murder is my lunchtime break companion good clean fun good humour and nostalgia for the days of the dick van dyke show how innocent we all were how innocent is diagnosis murder i particularly enjoyed the episodes with other nostalgia figures like joe mannix the bad guys always get caught the good guys carry on the stars clearly enjoy themselves and are having a ball without taking themselves too beef why were so many of the villains women or at least bitches amanda was too dizzy its hard to imagine her really carrying out anything as gruesome as an hope we haven't seen the last of dick van dyke and family on our screens esp at lunchtimes
presque rien is a story of two young boys falling in love during summer stay by the seaside i don't want to tell the plot because not most important about this film you can be sure that interesting and original the best part of this movie is the cinematography the visual side of presque rien is so amazing it deserves highest note it leaves you charmed with its for the plot it is shown in uneven rather complicated way there is no simple chronology nor there are answers to all the questions the film brings but this is what makes presque rien even more interesting i recommend this movie to all the people for whom the artistic side of films is very important and they will not be disappointed
i love this film one of those i can watch again and again it is acted well by a good cast that doesn't try too hard to be star premise of a newly widowed housewife who turns to selling pot to make ends meet could have been made into an americanised turd of a movie or an action thriller either would have killed the film film plays out like an ealing comedy with a terrific feel-good factor is worth watching just for the scene with the two old ladies and a box of cornflakes not a spoiler
a strangely enjoyable effort combining an appropriately far-fetched plot involving adam and burt and flashbacks to the original tv series most of the flashback scenes were lifted directly from burt book boy wonder my life in tights and i imagine his book was the inspiration for making this movie like the book it left fans of the original series hungering for if you missed this broadcast it is definitely worth the effort to borrow a tape from a friend who may have recorded it i'm making a copy for my kids right now
i recall seeing this movie as a kid i don't recall where i saw it i must have been around years old i thought the movie was incredible and wished to see it again it came on the kung fu channel once but i missed it i was really bummed it is the best special-effects kung fu movie that i've seen to date i highly recommend it and now that i've discovered where to get it i can enjoy it once more and for years to come i also have to check out this return of the venom movie of which some have spoken so highly
this movie is funny and suitable for any age it is definitely family-type entertainment the cast does a fine job playing folks in the mid-western town of big bean illinois where we must assume nothing ever happens since the excitement of the decade is the new only exit ramp from the interstate the location appeals as suitably boring and totally unlikely for the invasion of earth by martians but these martians are totally inept despite being well-equipped with an arsenal of suitably ghastly and deadly weapons including one set on eradicating the martians too the martians dead-pan their lines and throw in just the right accents to make us the viewers and the locals wish to help them leave earth j j anderson playing the very young halloween carnivorous duck has just great lines watch this movie for laugher and entertainment thought-provoking it isn't but subtle and enjoyable it is
an imagination is a terrible thing to waste especially when you have talented actors jones wastes no time in siding the viewer with his protagonist who has shared an apartment with a slob will be crying with laughter anyone who has arrived while a meter maid places a ticket on your windshield will just plain cry we've all wanted to rip a terrible toupee off a head these are only snippets of in store when watching cross eyed a heartfelt film that should be a stepping stone for jones and his wry sense of humor both in front and behind the camera
i think it great example of the differences between two cultures it would be a great movie to show in a sociology class i thought it was pretty funny and i must say that i am a sucker for that lets band together and get the job done plot device it seems most people don't realize that this movie is not just a comedy it has a few dramatic elements in it as well and i think they blend in nicely overall i give it a solid
dog days is one of most accurate films i've ever seen describing life in modern cities very harsh and cruel at some points and sadly very close to reality isolation desperation deep emotional dead ends problematic affairs perversion complexes madness all the things that are present in the big advanced cities of today it makes you realize once again the pityful state in which people have lead society negative side of life in the city was never pictured on screen so properly i only wish it was a lie unfortunately it isn't
a charming funny film that gets a solid grade all around i saw a screener of this film recently at work it was so nice to see this film in contrast with all the crappy horror movies i see every day so much so that i figured i'd write in not sure if this film is going to theaters but i hope it does its a nice film to see with friends its a charmer and has some funny jokes the acting was terrific howard hessman and larry dorf the directing was pretty good a film that needed to be over-directed what really makes this film stand out i think is the writing it was like neil simon seinfeldish and the banter between characters is smart and has a nice rhythm as an aspiring screenwriter i notice those things a dork anyway a really cute film that i recommend
this movie is by far the cutest i have seen in a long time wonderful animation and adorable characters the bad guys were cute made this one a total winner in my book and also in the books of those i saw it with i still want to see it again but haven't had time better than toy story which was good too but not this good
damn show was kick ass back in the day and still continues to outshine cartoons today i can't wait to track down some of the to share with my little guy and see the same sparkle in his eyes i've already introduced him to voltron lions one not the vehicles i laughed my head off when he said to me one day sure watched some awesome cartoons when you were a kid how cool is on hollywood dust this one off and give it a live action attempt couldn't be any worse than spiderman oh man has been pretty lame so far for summer i'll shuddup
when you typically watch a short film your always afraid that the person creating the film tries to throw too much into it not the case with this one a great story about a young girl had enough and other worldly forces trying to help make things etebari does a wonderful job of representing the spirit of twisted justice and helps to convey the complexities of the blurred line of right and the young girl and the father give great performances in this wonderful short film but performance is definitely the show stealer in this definitely recommend this film for complexity performance and great over all story
firstly this is simply the funniest movie i have ever seen it incorporates perfectly-timed slapstick sexual humour and cleverly-thought-up stand-up but it goes deeper than that the souler opposite is an original love story we don't see that often that gave me hope that there is love out two people who love each other can work through their adversity and that such a comedic take on life i believe we all should have can be accepted by the people that really matter chris meloni gives a such a convincing performance as barry singer that he should have won an oscar the film is brilliantly written and i hope we will be seeing more films from everyone involved in the future
wow this film had a huge impact on me it moved me it is an amazing story about a girl in cambodia who is sold into the sex trade i can not stop thinking about the fate of the little girl named holly the setting of the film is realistic the film was an eye opener i can not imagine anyone walking away from it with out wanting to help make a change with this horrifying problem that content of the film was very very moving it was one of the best films that i have seen this year who plays holly does a fantastic job with her character ron livinston gives a fantastic performance the film moved me to tears it tells an important message that needs to be heard worldwide everyone should go see this film i think this film will make a difference i loved it
this is one of the best military films ever made and it is great because of its focus on values a great human interest story that turns on a commitment to honor loyalty love and and deniro are superb in the lead roles wonderful to see the master racism evolve toward respect and love through carl determination yes sense of honor the title indicates the source of their bond i never noticed until this last time watching it how brilliant carl portrayal of father mac brashear was in a way a cornerstone of the film in that memory of his father that helps carry him through hard am selective about what films i purchase this is one of those rare ones that i want on my shelf it will be seen many times in the future i'm sure
maybe i identify with this film cause i live in nyc and suffer from bad insomnia but whatever it is i must praise the filmmaker on a most amazing job to do what she did with no thats all i can say really really good like no money was spent on this film and it still blew me away i definitley suggest checking it out if you can great directing fantastic score and of course a script that will knock you on your arse see it
i have seen this movie a whole dozen times and awesome but the only thing with it was that in the beginning there was too much talk of going out with who i think that it would be interesting to do a remake of it but on the official site they said that they will not be making a remake of it because so many people have gotten saved when viewing it even happened to patty dunning now she is a pretty good actress she has done several other movies in the and but we haven't heard from her since i know for sure about thom rachford who plays jerry works for accounting at rd films but overall i have to say that the series itself is like left behind gone old school
this was a wonderful film how these women tried to save their husbands i thought that the performances of the actors were great i had to think about the film for a very long time i think that every student should see this film so that they can think about war relationships friendship and love i liked the film because it told and showed me how strong love can be i wish i could be so strong as a woman i really liked it because it told me something about relationships and that is what i like to see in a movie i think you can compare the film with der untergang the pianist if you put these three films together you have a great sight of what happened during the war we should remember something like the war forever
this is an awesome classic monster flick from the i just love the look of the in general like the cars and the music anyway i love the way the blob looks i love when the everyone is at the late night horror flick at the theater and the blob comes in and crashes the party another thing i love about it is that it takes place all in one night just like halloween steve and jane are making out they see a meteor fall from space inside the meteor is the blob whenever the blob consumes a person it grows bigger and bigger they try to convince the people of the town about the blobby monster but no one believes them until later can anything stop this blobby creature i highly recommend the blob
in a lot of his films kane confidential report touch of evil orson welles gave him the role of an exuberant men in the lady from shanghai the only time i see him holding the role of the victim the role of the culprit he gave it to rita hayworth i guess because he was in love with her therefore an interesting film but i find the story excellent too the direction is genius as usual with welles two scenes are particularly brilliant the one in the aquarium and the final one with the mirrors this film is
spoilers like other posters i felt that the ending was a bit abrupt i would have liked to have seen the crew adjusting to life back on earth after their return i suppose the writers anticipated this problem by front loading some voyager on earth sequences at the beginning of the episode course that time line has been eradicated so all moot i did like how admiral janeway died for the voyager crew as fans we get to have our cake and eat it to by having janeway both make the ultimate sacrifice and live on i admit that the scenes of janeway and her older self having conversations was bizarre and so easily could have crossed the line into camp fortunately pulled it off
always enjoy the great acting talents of harry who plays a straight as an arrow husband who seems to get all kinds of attention from very charming young women namely lisa who is a co-worker with jim lansford and you wonder why he doesn't try to hit on her for some fun annie the a very warm and sweet loving wife to jim and has complete trust in her husband kris wants to always keep her husband happy and even buys him a home with out him even seeing it for himself this film will keep you guessing right to the very end
this is a nice little horror flick that fans of indie films will really appreciate it has good acting lots of gore and a decent plot one will be reminded of movies like the hills have eyes and pumpkinhead obvious that the budget was not all that big but the film really makes up for it with atmosphere and solid performances by the actors which seems to be lacking in a lot of big budget special effects-filled films the film really moves along and there is excellent direction and good camera work there are no wasted scenes so the length is a bit short in addition it looks like the ending leaves an opening for a sequel which would be very interesting as well so grab some popcorn turn down the lights and enjoy this one
this was a very enjoyable film a humorous but poignant look at family and the obligations that come with it the story of a man who comes home from his life in the city to his fathers bath house in a small chinese village there he learns to appreciate even cherish the very things he left home to get away from the film is as visually beautiful as it is emotionally beautiful
clara bow calhoun is daughter of plantation owner albert gran calhoun who is mainly interested in playing cards and boozing with friends interested in riding in the countryside until engineer clive brook haldane shows up to build a dam one of her friends arlette marchal bane then competes for his attentions his wife maude truax haldane shows up for the contrived of pre-code elements like nude location shooting in hawaii
i was absolutely mesmerised by this series from the moment tom long walked into shot the whole bad boy thing it was just story has you hooked what will happen next will joey get the girl in the end after doing years in prison and all that time thinking about his lost love crossing paths with her again finding he has a son although he is a violent bad guy you still want him to find truly captivating two parter please bring it out on video
there are four great movie depicting the vietnam war they are no particular order apocalypse now born on the fourth of july platoon and finally tigerland all but tigerland focus on the actual war and the men in it tigerland focuses on men in advanced training for the vietnam war the character of boz is one of the most important depictions of a man questioning war and the absurdity of it this has been done in many war movies but rarely in boot camp also this is a very complex character whose method with dealing with his feeling and emotions are the driving force of this movie the character of boz makes this movie so good it is a shame it did not get a major release it belongs on the shelf of any movie fan alongside the aforementioned movie titles
well there is a plenty of ways how to spoil a political thriller usually they are derivative or too ambitious often they feature a conspiracy that is totally paranoic and unbelievable but city hall does not do neither of the above mentioned the plot is cleverly crafted story is believable as far as characters go i would say this movie is a solid average no character seems out of place and al pacino is brilliant as always his portrayal of a charismatic nyc mayor is superb and proves again that al pacino belongs to the absolute top of american actors nowadays
suraj barjatya is best in movies on marriage and here he is back to his basics on vivaah as the story goes this is a story from engagement to marriage a movie you can watch with your entire family around you a movie you will hate watching alone the story is simple but the music is good cinematography is excellent direction is best everything about the movie has a class of its own there are a lot of scenes which will make you cry and am sure if you are watching the movie with your sweetheart you both are definitely going to hold each others hand till the end of the amrita jodi has given us hit movies earlier like ishq vishq shikhar though shikhar was a good movie it wasn't accepted well by the truly shahid amrita film
i got to see the whole movie last night and i found it very was at like the teen-slasher movies that pop out every now and search for the killer and the partner relationship between the so-called bad guy was parts i liked about the remember once being on the edge of my seat during a specific scene in the mean some time might watch the movie again
i have looked forward to seeing this since i first saw it listed in her work finally found it yesterday on lifetime movie comments about it being a sweet funny story of people crossing paths were dead on writers probably shouldn't get a bonus everyone else sro for making the who appreciates a romantic movie should see screen presence is so warm and her smile so electric to say nothing of her beauty that anything she is in goes on my favorite list her tv and print interviews that i have seen are just as refreshing and well worth looking bless her her family and future movie doesn't seem to available in dvd or video yet but i would be the first to buy it and i think others would too
the plot doesn't begin to describe the film a man is writing a film or rather film totally self referential to the point that you think going to fold in on itself like a black hole the writer writes something and it happens or something happens and he writes about very philosophical like waking life but more zen oriented and for that matter much better in my opinion at one point there are person-on-the-street interviews and then you see shots of these people being filmed and then you discover that their responses are scripted when one keeps flubbing her lines there is beautiful scenery and optical hope it comes out on dvd so i can watch it again more carefully seen at cinequest san jose ca film festival on
i've recently watched this movie in a lazy sunday afternoon with some friend of mine and we have a lot of fun this movie is a masterpiece of trash try to watch it with this purpose it hadn't been expected of course but the performance provided by the actors alberto tomba is absolutely the best the weak script and the low-cost budget had created an amazing mix of foolish things tomba was just retired from alpine ski racing where he was a dominant technical skier in the late and tomba won three olympic gold medals two world championships and nine world cup season titles seriously about the director nobody knows why damiano damiani he has signed this movie all the other directions are considerable
my husband and i just got done watching this movie i was not expecting it to be this good i was really astonished at how great the story line was i'm usually very good at figuring out twisty this one had me i loved it i'm going to have to watch it again before i take it back i might even have to buy it
i used to watch this show as a child and i loved it i watched it when it came on toonami years i sound so old i must've been or when it came anyways it had a great plot line and i'm one of those girlie-girls who watched adored sailormoon and i enjoyed it very much the animation wasn't the amusing in some parts actually and the voice acting was extremely lame in the beginning but it was all a good watch and i found myself sucked into it day after warriors is a classic and an all-time one of my faves go ryo
shower keeps within itself in so many ways almost all of the movie takes place in an time bathhouse with the denizens supplying the humor pathos and emotional touches the love and friendship between the proprietor and his retarded son is deep and moving the way the older brother is drawn into this tiny world seems unforced and persuasive the plot is meandering full of surprises and ironies and touched overall by a sense of what i'd have to call neighborliness in the relations and conflicts of the performers this is a film i pull out when i want to believe in the world again
i loved this show from first airing and i always looked forward to watching each episode every week the plot characters writing special affects were outstanding then the sci-fi channel screwed up yet again and canceled a very entertaining well written show i say bring it back i know all of the actors would come back i would suggest buying the i am i hope the sci-fi channels executives get word of these comments and realize that they need to be more involved with their viewers i only watch one show on that channel now hunters but i am fairly sure that shortly they will cancel that too
cowboys james stewart and walter brennan take their herd from seattle to alaska and on into canada to stake a claim once there they have to contend with seductive shifty businesswoman ruth roman and ice-cold happy-go-lucky villain james wayne may get talked about more but his good pal stewart made some excellent hard-edged westerns too some with the great director anthony mann frankly i'd take this with sturdy action sequences and fine melodrama over north to alaska any far country features some breathtaking scenery and cinematography that should definitely have been shot in some strong support by the always reliable brennan roman great the incredibly cute corrine calvet and james mcintire who plays one of my favorite types of bad guy the kind that doesn't take himself too would make a great double-bill with another highly recommended northwest-set western bend of the river
this game is the bomb and this is the game of the year and should be on greatest hits when i got agent under fire i thought that was a good game but then nightfire came around and that was better but now there is a new type of james bond game this time it a person shooter and there is more than missions the graphics of the game are out of this house it even has all of the great actors and actresses in this game like pierce bronsan as once again james bond william dafoe as the villain nikolai diavolo and judi dench as m me all if i spell it wrong this game would be own as the greatest james bond game give this a
so we compromised this was a fairly charming film i liked the art direction felt far more real than most kids movies and the costumes weren't too cutesy the child actors were not bad to watch adult performances trended toward cheesy it was great that they showed how a bullied kid bullies others as well as kids standing up to don't know how many grown ups would want to see this for themselves but a great film to take a kid to and since barnyard was apparently attended by kids at the same time i'm really glad we picked the sparsely attended showing of worms instead
i saw this movie in the first couple of weeks it was out don't remember exactly when i thought that it was alright for a ben stiller movie this movie isn't for a person without a good sense of humor like most of ben jokes you have to think about them or like i said you have a good sense of humor from a couple of people on this website i saw that people didn't have anything good to say about it and it didn't get a very good rating but i would have given it a larger one this movie i thought was very good and it should have gotten a better rating maybe this isn't a movie for you i'm just giving you another opinion
dark remains is a home run plain and simple the film is full of creepy visuals and scares that will make the most seasoned horror veteran jump straight out of there seat the staircase scene in particular these guys are good although they weren't working on a huge budget everything looks good and the actors come through dark remains does have one of those interpretive endings which may be a negative for some but i guess it makes you think cheri christian and greg thompson are spot on as the grieving couple trying to rebuild there lives however some side characters like the sheriff didn't convince me they aren't all that important anyways i give dark remains a perfect ten rating for being ten times scarier than any recent studio ghost japanese remake
the movie was very moving it was tender and funny at the same time the scenery was absolutely beautiful peter faulk and paul reiser gave award winning performances olympia dukakis was great i understand due to the story line her part had to be brief but i did wish i could have seen more of her-she is a true will be able to recall experiences from your own life hopefully in a positive way after seeing this movie we were fortunate to see paul reiser at a q and a after the viewing he is a wonderful man clever eloquent and a real person it was truly an enjoyable night is a must see movie you will be so grateful you went
i miss dark understand not ever one likes it but as far as i'm concerned the show should not have been canceled especially for another space show mock reading the books now they are doing a pretty good job of explaining somethings but i still think we should get a tv movie or freak nation lives
teenager eddie spends his life being bullied and humiliated due to his obsession with heavy metal music one day he finds out his hero sammi curr has died supposedly burned by the establishment which wanted to put a stop to his music but eddie has his last record never released and when he plays it he starts receiving messages telling him how to deal with his tormentors before long sammi has revealed he intends to return to life at the local halloween party to exact revenge on the town which once mocked with humour and in-jokes this is a highly entertaining film sammi himself is an original horror movie villain plays on the evils of rock music obsessions of the well worth watching
yeah sure cheesy not zombie but not that bad either it has beatrice ring which is a huge bonus and entertaining i had the good fortune to meet fulci later in his career and he remained philosophical about the experience as he was never completely satisfied with it it is well worth a search out especially for genre and fulci fans it is a film that is far too often dismissed out of hand
the old mill pond is more of a tribute to the african-american entertainers of the than any denigration of the entire race fetchit caricature notwithstanding besides who i just mentioned also frog or fish versions of cab calloway fats waller joesphine baker bill bojangles robinson and louis armstrong this happy harmonies cartoon from hugh harmon and rudolf ising is very entertaining musically with perfect characterizations all around they all sound so much like the real thing that half of me thinks they could possibly be if not they're certainly very flattering impersonations even the lazy shiftless fetchit characterization gets an exciting workout here when he gets chased by a tiger as hold that tiger plays on the score highly recommended for fans of animation and jazz music
this is an extremely long movie which means you may become very bored before it becomes interesting but its length provides opportunity for its characters to find permanent attachment in your you are moved by the guilt of the loathsome you will find it particularly heart-wrenching because it is a story that finds its heroes among the evil and the weak if you can love a monster you'll cry for magnus pym the spy who betrays everyone notably his country his friends and family a man who has also been manipulated and moulded since childhood by those same isn't one truly likeable character in the entire story not one loyal moral personality to sympathise with but watching the whole thing without the help of a tissue would be quite really enjoyed it in the end well worth it for people who like inciteful movies about baser human character
a lot of people hated this movie but that i blame on two facts they want it to be too much like the first couple of american pie movies and they are trying to take it too one i found was the best one out of all six and i absolutely love dwight the plot is predictable i'll say that but then what teen comedy isn't road trip dirty deeds etc etc they are all incredibly predictable but still goddamn funny i say this is worth watching i love it i find it hilarious just don't watch it while comparing it to the first ones because nothing watching naked mile and this one it became obvious that all the american pie movies were about and only about the stiflers which is fine by enjoy love xd
this movie documents a transformative experience for a group of young men and the experience of watching it is in itself transformative for the viewer few movies even aspire to this level of transcendence and i can think of no other movie documentary or drama that achieves it there is no other movie in which i have both laughed so much and cried so much yes it is about dmd and accessible travel on those issues alone it is a worthwhile venture but it is more it is about friendship it is about life itself about living every day that you're alive and a great fun adventurous narrative this is why god created the cinema see this movie
i really enjoyed this documentary about kenny and attempt to pitch the dawn was a great look at how outsiders try to get to the inside to make it big story was put together well and organized in an interesting manner that made the film flow well certainly worth a watch my only complaint is that their appeared to be no closure perhaps that is part of the point we expect it but in reality that is not what happened usually film is also a great way to see the personality of kenny and spencer outside of their canadian television show you can see a bit of what is yet to come look forward to a chance to see the papal chase
very rarely does one come across an indie comedy that leaves a lasting impression cross eyed is a rare gem the writer director not only tackled the challenge of directing his own work but gives a hilarious performance as an evil roommate the script takes an interesting look at not only the plight of the struggling writer but mixes so much comedy into the desolate world of the writer that you can't help but commit to ernie as a character very funny stuff despite the tiny budget adam jones manages to give the film a serious look not messing around when it comes to making a good movie i can't wait to see what he comes up with next this guy can make people laugh and think special
i love sabrina its one of my fave shows my favourite episodes are the one where she turns libby into a geek the first episode the true love episode and most of the rest from the first series i do think the college episodes were not as good as the high school ones but they were better than the last series which was awful valerie was a good character as she was more rounded than jenny but jenny was in some brilliant episodes hilda and zelda were amazing and there seemed to be no explanation for where they went libby was a good character too i never liked morgan or roxy they just weren't as good as her other friends
i really enjoyed the performances of the main cast emma lung is courageous and interesting the director has developed performances where the characters are not one dimensional a complex story with the changing between eras also appreciated the underlying story of the unions losing power and the effect of a large employer closing on a small town i do not agree with the comment that the older man has to be attractive there have be many relationships with older men and younger women without the male being good looking depth of character can be appealing to the not so shallow the film has a good look and the cinematography is also good
for his first ever debut this film has some riveting and chilling moments in the best horror film fashion the pit of your stomach tightens every moment during this film the ending is superb the makers of blaire witch obviously watched this film ending wasn't an end but a beginning of the end a great movie and only a piece of great as far as scare factor a perfect score it makes you think and scared out of your mind
this movie was rather awful vipul last movie was good this one was just bad although a good story and is handled in a great way aatish kapadia who adapted this movie from another gujarati play avjo wahala fari malishu made a good but slow pianful and a half hours to watch there are a lot of flaws in this movie but still a entertainer songs are rather bleaked out and don't work well but they're still good overall not a movie you would enthusiastically watch still a story to take in to account and good if you're the relationship type pretty good movie with loads of flaws and humor really not needed even one bit
i couldn't keep from commenting after reading the very short not bad commentary this movie is much better than just not bad the acting is stellar even from the children in the cast who don't play cute or anything else but act just like my friends the movie is smart and expects audience to be as well the double back flash story lines are imaginative and contribute to the story rather than act as time filler i watched this movie with my kids and then i watched it again by myself a few days later if you have kids and are sick to death of movies that inspire a diabetic coma with their syrupy sweetness then check out holes my enjoyed it as much as my and my husband and i enjoyed it as much as the two of them how many movies can you say that about
one of the more sensible comedies to hit the hindi film screens a remake of priyadarshans malayalam hit boeing boeing which in turn was a remake of the hollywoon hit of the same name garam masala elevates the standard of comedies in hindi kumar has once again proved his is one of the best super stars of hindi cinema who can do comedy he has combined well with the new hunk john abraham however john still remains in akshays shadows and fails to rise to the new gals are cute and do complete justice to their must watch comedy leave your brains away and laugh for hrs after all laughter is the best medicine ask priyadarshan and akshay kumar
the kids aged to got such a huge kick out of this film that we gave a copy to all of the other kids on our birthday list this year they all loved it kids from to watch it repeatedly and frequently and we get a kick out of watching it with rare that a film entertains the kids for so long and offers laughs for the adults too most enjoy it more than the production and an excellent cast led by christopher showerman as a superior energetic and wholly credible with a lovable innocence and a particular knack of taking a tree in the supported by the inimitable christina pickles as the evil mother-in-law thomas haden church as the evil jerk rival and everybody else this is fun
if the answer to this question is yes then you should enjoy this excellent movie i've just seen it a couple of hours ago here in paris the action of the movie takes i can still feel the huge trauma i received in the back of my a visual shock i've never seen such a beautiful photo and such a drastic change in the way of doing animated movies i strongly believe there will a before and after renaissance similarly to what we saw with pixar movies or the akira and ghostintheshell experiences this is a real breakthrough in the small world of animated movies and i hope this french initiative small unknown french studio with a few young folks who had a dream named renaissance will receive the success and recognition it deserves vive la france
this is film that was actually recommended to me by my dentist and am i glad he did the blend of british humor i say humour and the reality of a lost middle-aged widow trying to maintain her lifestyle were a hoot add to that mix the reality of what it takes to actually grow pot plants under the bushes were not going to make it without the tlc they received and it is a truly hilarious yet touching film i laugh every time i conjure the vision of all the bar patrons sitting in their lawn chairs with sunglasses on counting down the lights maybe just my mendocino county blood but the brits definitely got this one right
the movie is very realistic absolutely it does not belong to the hollywood cinema genre where every line must be pronounced in a perfect manner and where every move is precise the actors playing the roles of the lovers do a great job representing the characters feelings and thoughts their everyday life adventures overall the movie climaxes the viewer to a depressed state this is where the realism of the whole story is apparent not everything happens the way we think it should happen i can say though that the movie does not end on a bad note we watch we learn we experience ourselves that is probably the moral of this story
i must have seen this a dozen times over the years i was about fifteen when i first saw it in b w on the local pbs bought a dvd set for the children to see and am making them watch it they don't teach history in school and this explains the most critical event of the century it expands their critical with the participants on all sides explaining in their own words what they did and why it details what lead up to the war and the actual it for your children along with alistair america watch it with them and make them understand you'll be so glad you did
yes a true classic this is what british drama is all and the minimal use of special effects over inflated budgets i last saw this drama when it was last screened on british terrestial tv in it truly should be viewed by everyone who likes a scary big names but non-the-less great the copywrite is now owned by someone unknown and as such this great drama is unlikely to be aired anytime myself recently acquired the woman in black on now once again i shall be able to enjoy this truly great british drama you should try and enjoy it r horobin
i think that this movie was reasonbaly good kinda weird that now the olsen twins are and have boyfriends and all i enjoyed them alot when they were little kids on full house anyway the casting was good and the movie was somewhat funny i kind of got mixed up between all the switching places and their names just kind of an older version of it takes two
in the process of trying to establish the audiences empathy with jake roedel maguire the filmmakers slander the north and the jayhawkers missouri never withdrew from the union and the union army was not an invading force the southerners fought for rights the right to own slaves elect crooked legislatures and judges and employ a political spoils system nothing noble in that the missourians could have easily traveled east and joined the confederate seems to me that the story has nothing to do with ambiguity when jake leaves the bushwhackers not because he saw error in his way he certainly doesn't give himself over to the virtue of the cause of abolition
this movie is just a lot of fun i've seen it a couple of times but it always has something funny that i remember the duckies and bunnies car scene is one of my favorites and i still quote versions of certain are so many running jokes that amazing but i love michael keaton anyhow
i find alan jacobs review very accurate concerning the i had the opportunity to rent the dvd from blockbuster with a commentary from curator motion picture archives james d'arc the then lds prophet heber j grant approved of the movie understanding the deviations from historic content for dramatic expression and telescoping events for example the movie showed joseph smith on trial despite brigham great oratory in defense of joseph smith he was convicted anyway then joseph was killed historically joseph smith was never convicted of anything brigham young was in boston when joseph smith was arrested for this particular trial joseph smith and his brother hyrum where both killed before the trial took place
excellent gritty and true portrayal of pioneer ranch life on the western plains with an emphasis on the role and place a moving film lovingly made and based on real people and their actual experiences low budget independent film never made any money definitely not the romanticized unrealistic hollywood version of pioneer life
i wasn't alive in the so i can't guarantee that this movie was a completely accurate representation of the period but it is certainly a moving and fulfilling experience there are some excellent performances most notably by josh hamilton with honors jerry o'connell who play brothers divided by the war bill smitrovich a character actor who has been long ignored by many gives a heart-filled performance as their strict father who is forced to question his own beliefs and values as one of his sons makes him proud by going to vietnam but returns empty inside while the other is exactly the opposite all in all this is a powerful and heartwarming film that i hope everyone gets a chance to experience
despite reading the initial comments from someone who curiously disliked the film is the only negative comment very first on the was very nice to note that virtually everyone else loved it obviously the church wanted to stress certain points and portray the prophet joseph smith in a positive manner thats the whole idea and in fact those points were extremely effective we already know joseph smith was human but despite that and all of the horrific negative attempts stirred on by the adversary it showed just how he was able to complete a remarkable god-given work i'd recommend it to anyone
michael jackson is not very popular in usa anymore however in europe germany he has still got lots of fans many will say that this is a bad movie and it is it has no plot full of cliches michael praises himself you can't expect a plot or non-cliches in this kind of movie it has entertaining visual effects and the music is perfect the smooth criminal fragment the greatest song ever full of moonwalks group dance acts and even the famous michael bench-over makes this film one of masterpieces with an even good-looking white michael must for jackson fans a must for music fans a must for dance act as i'm an mj fan i should warn all michael jackson haters out there don't watch this movie you'd only make your hate increase
this movie is so wonderful hard to find words to describe it this is the only time i can't decide which was better the book or the goldberg is awesome and oprah winfrey such a good actress she could be funny happy and miserable all at the same time all together the movie was well directed by steven speilberg and should not be passed up
when paris is burning came out i totally dismissed it i was not into the whole madonna and vogueing phenomenon i thought it was going to be campy and silly how wrong i was about this movie i watched it after the movie had been out for ten years and i ran out and bought it it took me back to a time and place of fun and excitement i felt as though i knew all of the characters personally the were spectacular and the movie captured the essence of the gay culture what a terrific job i went on the internet and found out what some of the original casts members were doing now but i have not been able to locate all of them if any one has any information on any of the casts members please let me know hope they make another documentary i loved it
love is overwhelming in all manifestations gorgeous absolutely gorgeous tudor chirila maria popistasu and ioana barbu one truly dramatic story about love in all shapes a story about the undecipherable ways of young hearts about life and lost innocence all directed by the skillful eye of tudor giurgiu with a magnificent soundtrack featuring faultline chris martin and vama veche it surprises in every way leaving behind the sour taste of misunderstanding love truly remarkable is it me or is romanian cinematography slowly but surely advancing and gaining respect this is a brilliant film two thumbs up to everybody involved
i absolutely loved this movie i bought it as soon as i could find a copy of it this movie had so much emotion and felt so real i could really sympathize with the characters every time i watch it the ending makes me cry i can really identify with busy character and how i would feel if the same thing had happened to think that all high schools should show this movie maybe it will keep people from wanting to do the same thing i recommend this movie to everybody and anybody especially those who have been affected by any school truly is one of the greatest movies of all time
german private tv is ill-renowned for copying dutch and naturally us formats well in the case of edel starck the xeroxing only went as far as the basics can't stand screwball comedy don't watch edel starck seriously if you expect yet another lawyers drama thingy similar to or something well go somewhere else watch as quite brilliant at what it does but i digress is funny often addresses thought-provoking themes is funny romantic funny funny and witty i am quite dismayed the writers didn't get better deals after the final and my cynical nature needs to readjust itself re private german television productions german residents will understand what i'm talking short watch it i don't have the foggiest what the english synchronisation is like but hey worth learning german just to watch them four seasons pseudo-happy end included
the first time i saw this episode was like a shock to me it was actually the first time i saw the speed things are happening is amazing and so surprising thrilling and even interesting almost as if you are reading a book once you start it very hard to stop from the minute richard walsh was talking privately to jack about the possibility that they have a mole inside ctu i was sitting hours which means episodes funny and crazy but i'm the kind of guy which when he is interested he just can't series is one of the best of kind and build in a way of having a few different stories that are being connected together recommended in every way
like many of you i am a great fan of the real thing the noir films but red rock west was a real treat for all of us longing for the past the term neo-noir has been so often used inappropriately in the last ten years that it has lost its meaning and its impact john film on the other hand truly deserved to be described as such the casting is perfect all around and would have felt right at home with tay garnett or jacques tourneur the plot is so tight that you are hooked within the first fifteen minutes james m cain would have appreciated it many contemporary films leave me wondering why they don't make them like they used to and i'm not even that old movies such as red rock west give us hope for the future while paying tribute to the past
this has to be one of the best if not the best film i have seen for a very very long time had enough action to satisfy an fan and yet the plot was very good i really enjoyed the had me hooked from start to blood and gore in there but brought the realistic nature of what happens to the front of the film and even had a tear jerker ending for many people i should is a must watch for anyone seen many reviews slating the film but to be fair most the films that get bad reviews turn out to be some of the best this proves it once this film buy this film just go out and watch this film you will not be disappointed
watched both parts twice enjoyed the story and enjoyed seeing an older patrick swayze as the hero he was very believable as the hunter alan quartermaine and certainly bested the performance of richard chamberlain i do admit that i would have preferred seeing someone else as the lady in distress alison doody should stick with modern and not period pieces she didn't have the look of the woman of the the rest of the cast were terrific and followed the plotlines very well i am glad to see that the actors of this generation are not afraid to try on different characters and are not afraid to be seen as getting older age is inevitable but not hide from it a man at can be much sexier patrick truly is sexy then a green youth no matter how pretty hoorah for character lines to go along with a great smile
people are being too hard on the film sometimes we should just sit back and enjoy the story without attempting to review whole thing comes together when hackman decides not to pull the trigger but his target still goes down then the fun begins as everyone about him also go think jfk and all the people associated in any way with his assassination lives ended abruptly and in questionable ways and you'll appreciate what is implied in this think an excellent interpretation of what may well have occurred though the exact story line my not have been followed here after reading jim maars crossfire but what is implied that is of love to get a copy of it to view it again in light of what is known today the domino principle is right on
directed by brian de palma and written by oliver stone scarface is a movie that will not be forgotten a cuban refugee named tony montana comes to america for the american dream montana then becomes the king in the drug world as he ruthlessly runs his empire of crime in miami florida this gangster movie is very violent and some scenes are unpleasant to watch this movie has around f-words and is almost three hours long this movie is entertaining and you will never get bored you cheer for the drug-lord and in some scenes you find out that montana isn't as evil as some other crime lords this is a masterpiece and i recommend that you see this you will not be disappointed
note to previous reviewer this movie is science-fiction adaptation of the iliad according to the screenwriter so whether the references are painful or not no apologies it is the basis for the film they admit they adapted is the flick but too short probably didn't come out as well as the author director or studio wanted but pretty damn fun the fact that the studio itself imploded during the making only helps add to its big-budget remake wouldn't be as fun and probably wouldn't do the screenplay any more justice but fun to dream about the potential there a dvd release with some meager extras is apparently available but i don't think it would play on ntsc players i'm no expert and thus still trying to figure this out for now i live with the vhs incarnation
this movie about two italian brothers who came to germany with their family is just isn't an idealistic movie i would say it shows life as it is or was in the and when the main story takes place the characters are very nice but have also some dark sides what makes you believe that these are real persons great movie with great actors to show that life is not funny all the time but that you can find happiness with fire and passion as the main character gigi would say
in what must be one of the most blood-freezing movies ever a transvestite is murdering people in new york and the answer to everything may not be what people suspect one can see how brian depalma takes some influence from hitchcock with camera angles and stuff michael caine plays a most thought-provoking character while angie dickinson is basically a bored rich woman with a bad hairdo keith gordon later starred in christine is probably the most interesting character in the movie but you can't really understand this movie without seeing it and after seeing it you may never know just whom you can trust also starring nancy allen and dennis franz
page is a great movie the story is so refreshing and interesting not once throughout the movie did i find myself staring off into space konkana sen did a good job in the movie although i think someone with more glamour or enthusiasm would have been better but she did do a great job all the supporting actors were also very good and helped the movie along boman irani did a great job there is one thing that stands out in this movie the story it is great and very realistic it doesn't beat around the bush it is very straight forward in sending out its message i think more movie like this should be made i am sick of watching the same candy floss movies over and over they are getting hard to digest now everyone should watch page it is a great film my cents
this movie is beautifully designed there are no flaws not in the design of the set the lighting the sounds the plot the script is an invitation to a complex game where the participants are on a simple is at his best in this role his mannerisms the infections used in the tones of his voice are without miscue each shot meticulously done surprises turn up one after another when the movie reaches past its first hour this may not be the best picture of the year but a gem that has been very well polished not for the simple mind
i may have seen an episode or when the show originally aired but when i watched episode on netflix i was also hooked i watched the whole series in like days i really liked gary character first thoroughly reprehensible then you start liking the character things have a thousand uses his folksy andy griffith meets charles manson meets satan is great charming charismatic smarmy and uh kind of dangerous and by kind of i mean really i wanna be like him when i grow up lucas black is great too the accents are great too anyway i thought this was one of the best tv shows ever and you owe it to yourself to see it
jammin the blues is an oscar-nominated short from that is basically minutes of improvisational jazz played in one long jam marie bryant sings the sunny side of the street at one point for the highlight then jitterbugs with archie savage to bring this most entertaining jam session to its exciting end the director gojn mili was a photographer and that experience shows in some of the double exposure shots of some of the musicians that makes this one of the most innovative angles of the according to some notes i read one of the musicians was white and had to be filmed in silhouette in reflection of the social attitudes of the time what a shame still this most unusual film of the time is available on youtube so if you love jazz i suggest you seek it out there
an unexpected pleasure as i had heard nothing about this since it warrants having a wider wonderfully humane story with a social message gently told although admittedly predictable in its resolution solidly acted by the principals beautifully photographed with muted colors floating against grey that captures the nostalgic tone of the recent foray into chinese film the road home not one less has been an exciting one that i hope to continue exploring china and its people is an amazing canvas for film-makers the king of masks can be highly recommended as a starting point for anyone similarly interested in recent chinese
mulholland drive made me the definitive fan of david lynch a modern genius because not only a film-maker his stories and his style have a spell that cross the screen so the straight story was quite a surprise to me with its easy to follow storyline and sunny sets still lynch is there and while this is far from his best a film not to be missed late richard performance is one of the
girlfight is using a well-known formula as someone pointed out however i have seen plenty of movies that don't do it this well or that are not this credible i believe it is in the end easier for a woman to empathize the character and that way feel more touched by the movie is encouraging both mentally and physically even if your life and environment were completely different and i think the viewer can still gain a lot by seeing this although it took me years to start boxing and sports in general this is the movie that gave me the the plot is actors are good but the thoughts that it can spark are what make it above average in my opinion it made a big impression on me and i know i'm not the only one
the ship may have sunk but the movie didn't director james cameron from the terminator did it again with this amazing picture one of my favorite scenes is the dinner table scene in which family and friends meet jack after he saves her rose has a look on her face that every woman should have when you meet the hope i have that look when i am in the room with my future and rose have a connection that is movie stuff but good movie stuff we have the greedy mom and all her elite stuck up associates who live off of their husbands wealth rose almost commits suicide but the gilbert grape star rescues her i really liked the hanging over the boat scene it was a good movie is long but fantastic good story good flow good actors go see it twice if you want its worth it
i went to see antone fisher not knowing what to expect and was most pleasantly surprised the acting job by derek luke was outstanding and the story line was excellent of course denzel washington did his usual fine job of acting as well as directing it makes you realized that people with mental problems can be helped and this movie is a perfect example of this don't miss this one
six degrees is a wonderful show i watched the entire season online since i just found it and was terribly disappointed that there will not be a season and to top it all off abc has now taken it off-line so it is unable to be viewed online anymore why would abc create such a wonderful show with a great story line and with great characters just to pull it off the air without ever completing the tale it seems it is left to our imagination to figure out what happens to all of our connected characters honestly though i feel that abc could at least place the show online for viewers who enjoied it while they continue to air overrated reality tv shows six degrees we will miss you
one of the most underrated movies i've seen in a long time bill bogus journey is the second hilarious adventure of bill s preston esq and ted theodore logan aka wyld stallyns there are two ways to look at this film first you see dumb dialogue far fetched plot juvenile idea or you see brilliantly downplayed idiots who yet again find themselves in a situation too big for their brains throw a bruce willis or a arnold schwarzeneggar into this plot and it becomes a big blockbuster movie bill and ted go into the story with the same level of sincerity only bill and ted this is a tricky fence to balance on but when you watch the movie not as a throwaway screwball comedy but as an adventure featuring two guys who have no business being in an adventure it becomes so much more
i have wanted to see this for the longest time james merendino is a great director slc punk is one of my favorite movies and in the first ten minutes of this film i thought that it was a great follow up after that though it begins to drag the acting and direction were terrific in fact everything in the film seemed to flow except for the script at times the only thing keeping my attention was the fact that in the cast was the most beautiful woman in the world claire forlani this film was good but i expected look for great cameos by chi mcbride and chris mcdonald
i rated this a ten just because i find it so impressive what a single eighteen year old can do with a video camera no epic but plenty engaging and i was never bored if tens of millions of dollars can go into the countless bad films that are poured out en masse then give this director the same amount of money and see what happens i know i'll be lining up at the local cinema for her first major release damn good job and well worth the money what a script it might be low budget but it beats the hell out of half the major pictures i've seen lately nanavati knows how to tell a story both in writing and on screen serious kudos to her can't wait to see more
this is one of the greatest movies it sticks out like a turd in a punchbowl i can't believe mad magazine denounced it or whatever and yet they proudly put their name on a show with stuart i-speak-a-no-enlish chinese lady and ups guy on speed up with that and i love ron foxy wonder why he had his name removed from the credits it was his funniest role that i know of of course not nearly as foxy as he was in norma rae but in my opinion this movie is right up there with national vacation if you liked movies such as fast times last american virgin or any of the other teen-focused movies you'll love this one rent it and you'll see what i mean
i now that these days some people wan't see a movie without movie styling so much dogma lars von watchosky brothers are changed what we expect in a movie perhaps casomai is no-one-more-independent-non-american movie the movie take all movies resources and language to tell us a simple history about love and marriage but much more fully of views lectures and let you thinking and i'm sure you can't fell boried any second of a long minutes i calculate that don't have a single scene longer that o minutes
look this is quite possibly one of the best movies america has to offer the rest of the world to hate this movie is to hate freedom itself i remember that the early were a time of uncertainty the economy was weak communism threatened us all and nuclear destruction was almost a certainty out of that confusion came a hero stroker ace ned performance in this movie showed he was never again to be type cast as a one dimensional victim in the wilderness his triumph is an inspiration to all the on-screen chemistry between burt and loni draws obvious comparisons to brad and jennifer jim nabors is a poet go see this movie tonight
i first saw this movie when i was a little kid and fell in love with it at once the sets are breath taking and some of the script is damn right hilarious you sons of a thousand is always shown on tv late at night or really early in the morning i woke up at about am once and it had just started tv companys need to show a little more respect and put it on prime time sunday so everyone can get a chance to view this fine
this movie i saw some years ago more i took it in a rental and never found it to buy even in french sites the end is very surprising and intelligent i would like very much to watch it again because i think as surpring as the sixth sense althogh a completely different kind of movie
this is a really funny sexy movie that is not just silly but has great acting the kind of movie where the characters are so entertaining that you feel like you are connected to everyone in the theater i saw it at the boston film festival and i found myself frequently laughing out loud with everyone else and also moved by some of the more serious parts a unique movie about two doctors and i don't want to give anything away but there are some powerful scenes as well really funny ones plus the dialogue is great wood harris character has a unique relationship with his girlfriend zoe saldana and brian white and mya are also funny and sexy in their roles if you get a chance to see it go you won't be disappointed worth seeing again wood harris deserves an award
i'm stunt i must admit i never saw a movie with such good story and none stop high special effect martial art fighting scene if you like the fantastic genre like me you will certainly be more than satisfied all character have very cool power and the special effect are near perfection in one word flawless i will listen to this movie a lot in the next years
a film about and less-than-heroes making it against all odds where have we heard that before but when the unfortunates are the shoveller the blue raja and you know this is not your conventional rags to riches classic performance by eddie izzard as tony p one of the disco boys leaders and geoffrey rush as arch villain shows actual thought went into the casting greg kinnear at first glance an odd choice for the role of captain amazing turns out spot this film if you're sick of comic-gone-film stereotypes why couldn't anger be a super power
this wrestlemania just didn't do it for me while some things such as the battle royal and involvement of celebrities were a throwback to the good old days so to speak it seemed to be more of a highbrow in your house than anything else above it for several matches such as the tag team title match although worthy of note is that the title change meant nothing as it was reversed the next night
when i saw the trailers i just had to see the film and when i had i kinda had a feeling that felt like unsatisfied it was a great movie don't get me wrong but i think the great parts where already in the trailers if you catch my drift it went very fast and it rolled on so i was never bored and i enjoyed watching it the humor was absolutely great my first contact with a sloth something like it
yeah this films is tops cant recommend it more gay or strait its a great doco for anyone who likes film very funny sad and interesting never dull great access a film made with passion and interest in the subject matter some of the performances and just amazing if you only find this film on vhs it is still very worth watching great out of i got to see part of this doco years about ten years ago and did not understand what i was watching the interviews are very revealing about egos of the performers who are like weight boxers trying to punch their way out of the ghetto the filmmaker was apparently a first timer so what an achievement cool track it down
moonwalker is such a great movie from start to finish you cant take your eyes away i love all the clips of michael singing and dancing and i just love the studio tour funny and the mini movie is to cool with all the special fx is a genius and always will be
know what i mean after you've seen red eye red eye was a better-than-expected thriller it gets off to a slow start and slowly builds but by the time it was over a thumper hard to exactly define what makes this thriller as thrilling as i found it except that simply put the director did a creditable job of pulling you into the action of what would otherwise have been a run-of-the-mill plot i rather tended to forget i was watching a movie that says a factors i think are the closeness of victim and bad guy and that over time you begin to really relate to the victim a scant out of more like a but pretty good
after seeing this excellent film over times i still find new things that blow me away with this movie great special effects incredible acting and a plot full of ingenious twists makes this movie an excellent depiction of capitalism versus communism and in this ending everyone is happy and all is well best movie ever
the world at war is one of the best documentaries about world war episodes cover the war and what it was like in the countries involved in it the first episode tells us how the hitler came to power and how he was able to build up one of the strongest armies in the world they also fucus on the military actions taken during the war and the holocaust one of the strongest and best documentaries ever made all of you must watch this perfection
we watched this in my health issues class to point out how women are treated inferior to men in many societies and i absolutely loved this movie i plan on trying to get a copy of it myself to watch the story is very touching and i would recommend it to anyone i am a fan of different cultures and this movie was just what i needed this is a movie for the whole family despite its rating this is a movie i will show to my children the professor of our class meant for the movie to primarily be a too to educate about women but this movie was more than that it is one of those movies that will forever stick out in my mind and will be a favorite
not only was this movie better than all the final season of but it was better than any movie made for tv i have ever at the top i see that only one small screen movie has made it how the grinch stole christmas i think it is time to increase that group to will admit that the original series had several shows that were better than this but i didn't mind i just loved being able to enter the world of the baltimore homicide squad again
along with brothers sisters six degrees was one of my favorite new dramas of fall cast all around but really enjoyed the work of campbell scott come-back photog and hope davis widow of journalist killed in from the acting the writing was fresh and the acting superb the show was also shot in nyc the real city not the warner bros or some other backlot adding a secondary layer or realism guess people are more interested in the latest survivor and other reality garbage too bad it didn't last
this is one of the few films where i consider the film rendition to be an improvement on the original book the story is clear accessible amusing and interesting and the musical numbers are without a doubt exceptional i adored the cyclical rendition of the old home guard and the charming portobello road a great combination of early animation real actors techniques which though dated do not detract from the charm of the piece the background of the second world war worked well and was not omitted as the film got under way which so often happens in evacuee often far too underrated film it produces no end to enjoyment for people of all ages the performances from the actors are exceptionally well done and the entire text is neatly tied together and well designed guaranteed to put a smile on your face
even though the shining is over a quarter of a century old i challenge anyone to not get freaked out by jack descent into madness this is a rare example of something so unique that no one has been able to rip it off instead it has been referenced time and again in pop culture the twins the elevator of blood redrum the crazy nonsense writing this should be seen if for nothing else to understand all the allusions to it in daily life the film is simultaneously scary suspenseful beautiful and psychologically intriguing it has the classic mystery of hitchcock and the terror of a modern thriller and it has what horror movies usually lack a great script
after seeing jeremy brett as sherlock holmes no actor should ever display such conceit as to imagine that he could ever come close to mr portrayal of one of the most interesting characters in literature jeremy brett is sherlock holmes and in my opinion there can be no other the great actor basil rathbone must admit a close second but is still second one might make the argument that mr screenplays were inferior to the absolutely top notch productions afforded mr brett and to this i would agree however when all is said and done jeremy brett will always and forever be the only actor to truly become sherlock holmes the book should be closed on this subject and to enjoy unique rogers
yes giorgio is a feel good movie a little romance great music beautiful scenery comedy great food fight and a little taste of bittersweet are the ingredients of yes giorgio any movie buff would enjoy this film those who require massive special effects should look elsewhere most of us need a little escape now and then and how better to do this than with a feast for the eyes ears and heart a must see
i was really impressed with this film the writing was fantastic and the characters were all rich and simple very easy to get emotionally attached to all of them the creators of this movie really hit the nail right on the head when it comes to creating real life characters and getting the viewer sucked right into their world further the music is terrific they employed some independents to do the score and some of the soundtrack and they do a fantastic job adding to the movie if you have a chance to catch this movie in a small theater or at a film festival i did i highly recommend that you go see it also on a personal note paget brewster is beautiful in this movie reason enough to go check it out
i always look forward to this movie when its on tv have to get the dvd i guess the range of different types of people is great it says to me that anyone can be a dancer if they try hard enough my favorite character must be he is so quirky but so full of emotions it is a perfect movie with wonderful dancing unfortunately we never get the chance to see them go to blackpool would make for the perfect sequel if they had but i guess it leaves it to your imagination to what could of very simple and innocent story he stays loyal to his wife and haven't seen the hollywood remake not sure if i want to i don't really enjoy jennifer lopez i think richard gere more matches the original than lopez i have a feeling that the remake is not as simple and innocent
deathtrap is not a whodunit a who gonna do it to who first so hard to describe this movie without giving anything away so i won't mention anything more about the plot as far as acting goes it is cris reeves greatest role as clifford a young playwrite you really see the range in his acting abilities in this movie from exhaling cheeseburgers to downright frightening clifford is such a hard role to play and in the stage production of this i have never seen clifford played well on both ends of the spectrum the actor plays him as a little puppy or a homicidal maniac reeves is the only person i have seen who has the character right all the way through as for michael caine michael caine one of the best actors of the last years and in this film as good as he has ever been
this was the best documentary i've ever seen i just saw lords of dogtown and wanted to know more about stacy peralta and was surprised and happy to find out this was one of his films as well great job stacy i was kicking back at work last week bored and this movie came on growing up in orange county in the i surfed up and down the local beaches and so did my dad when he was a teenager i grew up at the beach my parents took me every weekend i body surfed boogeyboarded then moved up from there this movie just captivated me it was way before my time but it was awesome to see what these guys went pioneers this movie is a collectors item
wizards of the lost kingdom is a movie about a young prince who is banished from his kingdom due to his father king being killed by the cliche evil adviser this about adventures the special effects plot acting and generally everything about this movie is bad however so bad that funny you will keep watching this movie simply because so bad funny and like the other reviewer of the movie said so bad good
i suggested renting this movie to my friend and he obliged since he had already seen the film and he said it was okay i thought the title was a bit campy since the version at our store was called the night i expected this movie to be somewhat of a halloween rip off with a killer wooden guy but it opened with a good scene and the killer murdered two victims immediately and flashed forward twenty years later where his son who had witnessed him kill the two his mother and he even witnessed his fathers suicide is going to a secluded cabin in the woods with his friends and his girlfriend where he attempts to face his fears until a wooden statue comes to life with his fathers spirit pretty good for a sequel and i never even seen the first
i spent hours drenched in this film nothing i have ever seen comes close to the delicious funk this film left me in never mind females advanced aging human fear vaults off the screen for your viewing personally engaging to the ninth degree the film invests one with an undeniable shared feeling for our lives i enjoyed this dalliance with raw wounded gall deep from within it empowers a mutually shared vestment in the history of human encounters reaching far deeper into the pain isolation and skewed views of self and others the result forgives our tepid forming of a bridge away from the muddy sludge of dead we must encounter the birth in finding real people is a happy pursuit the effort for realism intersects with the dark ground of our bankrupt culture
whether three guys in their tighty-whiteys rapping to a dude bound in twine or a girl saying what up dog to a lump of roadkill something please everyone in knuckleface jones it is strange and surreal and not altogether a completely comprehensible yarn yet it never loses you the first time i saw it i nearly laughed myself sick and every night after i would come home and watch it again forget coyote ugly this is the movie that cemented my crush on piper perabo see it before too late
i saw this film when it was originally released in i enjoyed it then and i still do now but what i realize now is that this is quite adult for a film with a g rating especially the notion of dying and going to heaven burt reynolds and dom deluise work wonderfully together and reynolds singing voice is appropriate for a junkyard dog there are some good songs ranging from upbeat make music together to downright emotional to my heart i found the plot good although it does go off on a tangent once or twice the final scene of the film with charlie and anne-marie is one of the saddest i've ever seen in animation a film worth experiencing
saw this at the hawaii film festival where the director and his wife produced it took a found it hard to believe this is a first time director and all kudos to harvey keitel for once again taking a risk and going out on a limb for a script he reminiscent of cinema paradiso it tells the story of the young director on the turning of the revolution in cuba however don't expect this to be a movie about the revolution political stance is wonderfully ambiguous many references to the directors obvious love of film history great bicycle thief homage and some whimsical scenes which work with out being
released two years before i was born this oscar-winning movie has it all lavish technicolor sets and costumes breathtaking cinematography superb wall-to-wall gershwin music superior choreography a lighter-than-air screenplay and great performances by kelly levant foch guetary and caron hollywood doesn't make em like this anymore definitely this is my favorite movie of all time a standard by which i judge all other films enjoy enjoy enjoy
this movie was absolutely wonderful the pre-partition time and culture has been recreated beautifully urmila has given yet another brilliant performance what i truly admire about this movie is that it doesn't resort to pakistan-bashing that is running rampant in movies like gadar and loc with the partition as a backdrop the movie does not divert to political issues or focus on violence or what is right and wrong the movie always centers around the tragic story of life her fragile relationship with manoj bajpai has been depicted excellently the movie actually shows how the people both hindus and muslims have suffered from this partition the theme that there is only one religion is truly prevalent in this film
thieves and liars presents us with a very naturalistic depiction of the levels of corruption that affect many puerto ricans and force them to make difficult if not impossible choices about their and their loved ones lives the cast is excellent considering that some are non-professional actors an excellent choice that augments the level of reality in the film the photography propels the story without intrusion as it should be in this type of film the script captures the idiosyncrasies and attitudes of the boricuas in a very deep way sometimes it feels like you're watching a documentary watching this film you feel as if you've secretly entered the real puerto rican society and stand invisibly watching it implode i loved it
this was a good movie it wasn't your typical war flick but something a bit different this movie showed us recruits in training before the war and not actually fighting a war this film is one of the more realist views on war and the army than most other films like this made colin farrel did a great job at portraying an army recruit and clifton collins jr and also matthew davis contributed reasonably well seeing colin farrel move from b grade to a grade in a few short years you would never thought it would happen i will also add that the makers of tigerland did a great job at filming a movie in the year and making it look like was a good touch its good to see talent used wisely and i hope to see this same talent again in the near future
i really enjoyed this movie about the relationships that sometimes developed between american servicemen and japanese women in post-war well as the obstacles that prejudices created for them brando goes from having contempt for the japanese is natural considering to falling in love with a japanese woman and wanting to marry her his performance is okay am not a major fan of his acting style and the movie is marvelous throughout red buttons received an oscar for his touching performance of another gi who falls in love in japan the japanese women who plays opposite him also did a remarkable don't want to spoil it but the movie is a good one to watch with a box of movie manages to say something and be entertaining at the same time a mostly underrated gem
i read many commits when it was in the theaters and they were all think you have to be a certain type of person to enjoy these movies if you are not a person that enjoyed the waltons or little will not understand nor enjoy these about loves abiding knew he was bad news from the start of the wish it would have shown more of the end instead of letting you just think it this movie has a lot to do with is years later so you know he will be interested in want to say that i have enjoyed all movies so not crazy about the wait until the next movie the way clark talks will get you every time i would love to see january jones do an a family reunion or something
something surprised me about this movie it was actually original it was not the same old recycled crap that comes out of hollywood every saw this movie on video because i did not even know about it before i saw it at my local video store if you see this movie available rent it you will not regret it the suspense builds throughout and the twist ending is
i was hoping this was going to be good as a fan of timothy james bond and although it wasn't his deserved bond outing it was a laugh belushi brought some good humour to his part and dalton hammed it up nicely but was probably underused his part was liked a camped up version of jack nicholson in a few good men the other brit in it was a bit shocking but overal it was a laugh
a lot of the problem many people have with this movie is that they seem to think that the story should have been more entertaining it is based on a true story or ranting against a film that glorifies che it really doesn't this film is very close to jon definitive bio on che and gets the story right soderburgh does an excellent job of setting the mood for the unraveling debacle that was bolivian adventure you really get the impression of the total timidity and bewilderment of the bolvian peasant to revolutionary ideas or of the difficulties that his men faced with hunger and the terrain sorry to bore the attention challenged movie fan out there but that was how it happened so don't go into this movie expecting a rambo shoot em up its a true story
this is a film exploring the female sexuality in a way not so often used almost every other film with this kind of sexual scenes always becomes rated x and so seen as a pornographic movie here is a kind of romantic horror story combined with the females own satisfaction very good film
this is an excellent movie as a canadian who grew up with a rural lifestyle much of it is familiar the winter canoeing trapping hunting and the like it is easy to take the familiar for granted but after watching this film a few times it has grown on me story of grey owl is well known to many canadians credit to director attenborough and screenplay writer nicholson for expanding the does well portraying a complex man a very fine performance annie galipeau is lovely in her first large role the rest of the cast is solid
i heard a few friends one day saying that scarface sucks some idiot tried to make another godfather set in the early now i usualy listen to cnn so i decided i'd stay away from it then my mate handed me the dvd and said this is with the pelicangs confused i tried it this is the best film ever made more realistic than all this crap about racing stolen cars that are too expensive for someone in that area could afford there is some humor though the pelicangs and the light music still whats better than al pacino wielding an i give this a out of perfect for fans of al or city
what was always missing with the matrix story was how things came to be in the real world say no more because this part of the story covered most of the bases what was truly interesting was how political it was maybe even a cheap shot at the current presidential administration fascism and violence were the only things man could think of in regards to fighting the robotic horde who were meant as nothing more than servants to humanity what i also found interesting was the use of fear and how it was perpetuated by the idea of the unknown we as humans tend to fall into that trap quite often letting the lack of logic and thought overtake us because people can't believe the contrary well represented and put together this a true testament to how illogical humans can be
i can't believe others took such a serious view of all this god it was a lot of fun rooting for hop-a-long cassidy it was a great tribute to the western serials of years ago it wasn't meant to be a great cinema experience except it was so what if there wasn't a big special effects bonanza it was a fun tongue in cheek look at old man relax and enjoy
don't say i didn't warn you but your gonna laugh probably enough to hurt your stomach sure got some blood splattering all in good fun though so got no budget who needs a budget when you got a script like this the time and check this out well worth a two hour viewing if everyone could laugh as much as i did during this movie the world would be a much happier place to
sorry i don't have much time to write i am not a psychologist but have known one for years she said that scott wilson portrayed a sociopath conscience extraordinarily well i agree she also said that robert blake portrayed a person with anger and impulse control who had a conscience but couldn't control himself superbly i agree what a chilling and tremendous film i have seen over films and would rank this in the top my lifelong friend deals with clients such as these regularly my only criticism was the preachy narration at the end of the film many people grow up in less than ideal circumstances but only one in a million will behave as these losers did
this movie describes the life of somebody who grew up in the worst of circumstances but unlike many people he actually grew up to be a respectable person whats more is that this is a true fisher is so innocent and yet he was abused such just because he was not white antwone fisher has been married to the same women for ten years and he never fooled around with women coke cigars weed alcohol or any of those things that are very popular in the places he was growing up is not much more to say about this movie it is excellent the only rating i can give it is a
this film is really cool every thing looks like it came out of the comic book the sets the costumes and the plot is great clark bartram is again our favorite batman he looked a bit better in dead end but he still pulls it off superman is great too the flying effects are ok but its a fan-film so we cant expect them to be the greatest the shot with superman catching the car was very believable it was cool this is a movie i would definitely see if it were real its got every thing you would want in a superman movie one exception though i would cast the joker instead of overall i give this film a because its a great film
i saw that movie few days ago this movie is so great that it makes me feel that if you want something really bad that you have always dreamed about it you can have it this shows a big wish come true trought happiness and sadness hopeless and failure but if you are strong enough and your heart really belongs to something that you love you can make things different and be happy
i suck at gratuitous boob references so i'm just going to write a plainly flat pun intended review i love elvira not in a i'm-going-to-shoot-the-pres-just-to-impress-jodi-foster-fanatical way but suffice to say i think she rocks the movie is played like a horror film only alot more fun look for the leasurely stroking of the ankle reference to know what i mean what relay shines through in the movie is should that be cassandras absolute charm i first saw this movie at the tender age of and have seen it contless times since i realy should get around to buying a copy the videostore version is looking a little worse for the wear if any other fans of the movie want to e-mail me about it feel another great performance from edie mcclurg pariah an actress who never gets the attention she deserves
last production but not his least interesting film somehow largely ignored by critics as he couldn't finish it himself and as the movie wasn't co-signed by preminger who he did most of the staging a very strange mix of musical remembrance of the merry widow and classic lubitsch touch sentimentalism impossible love-story like cluny a very clever and intelligent one yet not to be understood as some nostalgia of some lost world but rather a testament on eternal feelings prevailing on the foolishness of mankind and especially men in times of war with a moral lesson still true today as it was in billy wilder as an answer to preminger who grieved at funerals about having lost a great man replied that we still had his films and that sums it all up about that lady in ermine
when i saw this animation for first time was maybe i was really impressed it has completely different style compared to the japan animation and i kinda like it more tho whole impression of the movie is more sinister and colors are not that colorous the characters don't talk much there are no long and boring conversations of this and that in ghost in the its dark pictures views of strange beasts and sense of magic it looks like one of those ancient scandinavian stories full of violence and horrendous creators enchanted forests and deep caves dwelled by dragons throlls one mysterious hero to stop evil
this is one of the first independent movies i've ever seen for such a very low budget it was done well as an insomniac myself i can sympathize with the main character although my sleeping problems have never been as intense or as disturbing directed well acted of a subject that i haven't seen much in theaters lighting and set both perfect for the movie setting there are few noticeable goofs but they may be intended you'll see after you watch the movie the movie is very personal and worth watching twice no movie is flawless but a hollywood version couldn't do the story better all in all
last year we were treated to two movies about truman capote writing the book from which this film was made capote and cannot imagine a movie like this being made in a stark powerful and chillingly brutal drama elevated to the status of a film classic by the masterful direction of richard brooks gantry cat on a hot tin roof the professional blackboard is interesting that robert blake who starred in this film has had so many problems of late that may be related to his portrayal of a killer in this is a film that stays with you after viewing
rated be rated r for pervasive strong language and crude sexual humor quebec be canadian home video murphy delirious is first stand up comedy came out in then he starred in the movie hrs and trading places and he was on saturday night made two stand up comedy and preferred raw because i just found the subject matter to be more however is also very funny with eddie talking about his childhood and making fun of celebrities such as and singers such as michael fan of stand-up comedy films should see eddie delirious
ossessione is in very bad state but is now undergoing a full restoration at digital film lab in copenhagen the material used is a master positive generation originally from the print visconti managed to hide from the fascists it has been scanned on the spirit rgb data then processed using davinci revival restoration software after this the rest is manual labor and we do not anticipate finishing before early spring sometime next year it should be available on dvd and hopefully also released on hd dvd this film is beautiful and we hope the restoration effort will be enjoyed by many generations to come
this cute animated short features two comic icons betty boop and is the bald slightly portly boy from the comics who never here he does wants to get a puppy from betty pet store and when he is left to mind the store some hilarious hijinks sings a song about pets henry gets in a battle with birds and a monkey but everything works out in the end
having heard quite positive reviews and having seen the trailer i had to see this movie with william h macy luis guzman michael jeter and sam rockwell present it had to be good and it delivered overall the movie is not crack-you-up funny but there is one scene that really stands out and is in a my eyes a classic spoiler at the end where they break through the wall to get to the safe and we see rockwell and washington stare at jeter is just fantastic this is just as good as the scene in the big lebowski where the dude is using a chair to barricade his door but forgets the door turns outward end spoiler just go see this movie you won't be disappointed
some bad reviews here for this and i understand why but treat it as a low budget serial killer film and you might get more from it than thought that this worked in a way because afterwards i felt dirty and wanted to take a long shower so that is some degree of success isn't would say there is just the right level of sleaze here to get under your skin although the acting is maybe a bit too uneven david hess is only in this brielfy so don not get your hopes up to much if you like last than that worth a look
what an overlooked soundtrack i imagine john travolta sang some of the songs but in watching the movie it did seem to personify everything that was cheese clearly movies that rely on mechanical bulls bartenders and immature relationships were in style the best was his lousy texas accent compare that to friday night suggest watching cocktail and stir crazy to start really getting into the dumbing down of film also as a side note made in america with ted danson and whoopie goldberg is an awesomely bad movie i was so shocked to realize i had never watched it one more weird movie of this genre would have to include cadilac man with robin williams just remember all of these big stars played big roles in these cheesy movies tom cruise richard pryor robin williams and john travolta
this film was pretty good i am not too big a fan of baseball but this is a movie that was made to help understand the meaning of love determination heart glover joseph gordon-levitt brenda fricker christopher lloyd tony danza and milton davis jr are brought in with a variety of talented actors and understanding of the sport the plot was believable and i love the message william dear and the guys put together a great sports films revolve around true stories or events and they often do not work well but this film hits a on the perfectness scale even though there were a few minor mistakes here and
i could never remember the name of this show i use to watch it when i was i remember staying up late when i wasn't suppose to just so i could watch this show it was the best show to me from what i remember of it it is still great this showed starred lucas black making him the first boy i ever had a crush on i am from the country therefore boys with an accent have no appeal to me but for him i would definitely make an exception which after seeing crazy in alabama friday night lights and tokyo drift you should see why he is a great actor and has been since he was a kid i miss this show and wish it would come back out if anyone ever sees where they are selling the season please email me
this is my first comment this is a fantastic movie i watched it all by luck one night on tv at first minutes i thought it was a b movie but afterward i understood what an amazing product this suggested to some friends to see the movie only to tell me that it was a bad b movie how wrong superficial think that the movie is almost a product of genius the well known director made an excellent job here and it is a shame to tell that he was out of the game all this time
i really liked this movie because i have a husband just like the guy in this movie this movie is about lindsey who meets ben in the middle of winter when baseball season isn't in she falls in love but when spring comes along she gets the shock of her life when she is placed one step lower on her pedestal that ben has put her a funny movie with all of the baseball obsession that ben has he can't part from what he loves the most what makes it so funny and why so many women can relate to lindsey in real life also the people he sits with at the baseball games are just as obsessed as he a funny movie and you won't strike out if you rent this one
this is a more interesting than usual porn movie because it is a fantasy production values are high and the acting it or not pretty jenna also in widescreen which gives a feeling of a real motion picture and not a porn course it is a porn and a really good one with nice atmosphere and by the sex is out for this one
this is the who at their most powerful although before the masterwork next which would provide anthems like baba o'reily and wont get fooled again this film shows the group in transition from mod rockers to one of the biggest live bands of the shows what being a front-man is all about entwistle steady as ever is great check out the ongoing conversation with the drum tech and see him playing side saddle whilst having a bass drum head even looks like enjoying himself they took to the stage at no one in the crowd was asleep are not many bands these days could produce a set as tight as this and it is difficult to imagine any of the bands of today producing a concert that in years time will be be enjoyed as much as this one
i love bed knobs and broomsticks so much that it makes me cry a thousand tears of joy every time i have the magnificent pleasure of seeing it i would also like to reiterate the simple fact that i love it so much some have said i have copies on video and i love them all equally i also love anyone else who loves it i love you my favourite scene is the dance scene at portobello road i have learned the dance moves and practice it everyday i have some audio recordings of myself singing the song if anyone can play the drums or guitar i am thinking of forming a bed knobs and broomsticks hope to call it the knobs love me
the movie follows the events of the novel cel mai iubit dintre could be translated as the most beloved among humans written by marin preda a very controversial book and movie a novel which became something like the bible or the story of hamlet very popular and hard to get due to its satiric contents over the communist regime it represents the drama of the intellectual man the humanist in a red world a movie filled with passion fear sexuality all the great ingredients for a great movie of the greatest romanian its psychological all it is an european movie
when i was little my parents got this movie for me to watch i really liked it and i watched it over and over again even when i was in grade i still watched it from time to time recently i watched it again just for the sake of nostalgia and though the show was not aimed for my age group in my late teens i still found it entertaining and educational this show teaches good lessons about imagination and getting along well with others some parts i found quite entertaining also this show does not have any bad content so you can leave kids alone with this show and not worry about them picking up any bad language or whatnot i would recommend this
pushing daisies truly is a landmark in television as an art form everything seems to pay homage to amelie and tim burton but so what in a world where fresh ideas are distinctly rare this show will guarantee that you do not care about whether its fresh or not it is just have been captivated from the start the intelligent writing the directing to the backdrops and dialogue make this show the most incredible masterpiece since the shield and the wire not exactly good comparisons but the beauty of pushing daisies is that it has no comparisons on addictive and an absolute pleasure perhaps like one of the piemakers pies that get mentioned in such tantalising ways
neil simon has quite a body of work but it is the odd couple that carried him to fame this film really works jack lemmon walter matthaw have a great chemistry the supporting cast for this film is stellar as is about men living together who are from opposite planets the script bristles with humor from this situation this had been done in some forms previously this is the one that brings it all together in a very good has done some other decent work but this one is really his best work which made the rest of his work possible it is hard to imagine simon ever topping this
this show is awesome i thought that the two episodes where paul died were so sad i actually cried but the other shows were awesome kerry was my favorite character because she was in the dark side i also thought that bridget was funny because she was all perky i also thought that guy who played kyle was really really cute i loved it when kerry made sarcastic remarks about everything the guy who played rory was cute and paul played by john ritter was really funny this whole entire tv show is funny and i wish they still showed it on tv when they did show it on tv though i watched it every single time it was on the next time it shows i will watch it over and over again
i first saw this film years ago on television and thought it was a depressing look at the future wells sees restriction of private freedoms as a good thing no private airplanes the year plus war in the film was the reason this film was not shown to british film goers doing the war the concept of the future and the korda an co concept of the the machines of the future are the real stars of the film the very best acting performance is that of ralph richardson as the boss a combination of winston churchill and edina from absolutely fabulous comedy series it is interesting to note that the negative personality is somewhat similar to the war time churchill
william ball and emma peters davies buy an old house where a brutal murder happened years ago in very bad condition with the intention of restoring it they move with their daughter sophie ridley and become friends of their neighbors jean maynard and george evans croucher however eerie events happen in the house inclusive the death of cat in birthday party a pipe leaks blood and they leave the place disclosing a secret house that bled to death is a scary and one of the best episodes of the series hammer house of horror the fantastic twist disclosing a secret and the tragic conclusion are really excellent my vote is a casa que sangrou até morrer house that bled to death
take issue with the other comments for the simple reason that this is a mystery film not a supernatural one it is not the only film to have a seemingly supernatural explanation but turns out to be a very mundance films that come to mind are edgar before dawn and the famous mark of the vampire film does a wonderful job in creating a very spooky atmosphere similar dracula when renfield meets the count on the staircase of his castle or in mark of the vampire when the two people look thru the windows of the castle ruins and see a corpse playing an organ while luna descends using wings very one likes these silent atmospheric touches this film is a vogel
it was a saturday night and a movie called baseketball was on tv i had always wanted to watch it but never got around to it when it was in the cinema boy was i mistaken words cannot describe how funny this film is starring the creators of south park who share a natural on screen chemistry when being funny i taped the replay the next day and exactly one week after watching it for the first time i have seen it times im obsessed with it and i know anyone who appreciates trey and matts work will appreciate this movie a must see this is my comedy of all time
disney have done it again brilliant the way timone and pumbaa are brought back to life yet again to tell us how they came to meet and help simba when he needed them i love this film and watch it over and over again it shows how timone lived with his family and fellow meerkats before setting off to find his dream home and adventure then he meets pumbaa and things do change together they search for the home timon wants and repeatedly fail which is funny as timone gets more and more crazy then simba turns up and we see more of his childhood than we did in the previous films the rest you already know
this is definatley one of the best stand-up shows evre ever eddie is so off the wall that i've been watching this damn show for nearly five years now and it still rocks every single time just everything from his big broad physical comedy down to the little off the top of the head side remarks a masterpeice you need look no further than this line the word herb you say erb and we say herb cuz a h in it brilliant
i know this sounds odd coming from someone born almost years after the show stopped airing but i love this show i don't know why but i enjoy watching it i love adam the best the only disappointing thing is that the only place i found to buy the seasons on dvd was in germany and that was only the first two seasons that is disappointing but ok i'll keep looking online if anyone has any tips on where to buy the second through seasons please email me at i already own the first one the only down side is that the dvds being from germany they only play on my portable dvd player and my computer oh well i still own it
the cure uses voice over to create an intense mood although the vo accounts for all of the lines it amazingly does not take away from the visual story the use of multiple film stocks add a lot of texture to the story the choice of combining b w and color worked nicely to enhance the leaps in time the ending will make you jump despite being able to anticipate the result i was especially enjoyed the thrill of the suspense the close-ups for the love scene are also lovely and reflect a tasteful eye the piece is quite short but accomplishes a lot the tight editing really helps to show off what a short film can do worth watching more than once

this film was excellent the emotional power of tom hulce and ray performances brought tears to my eyes and joy to my heart this film shows us that there is still hope in the world if this film had come out at the end of instead of rain man hulce would certainly have been at least nominated for a best actor oscar definitely a must-see
its hollywood imitating daytiem soap operas at its finest its the fun that we never see great characters and great lines whoopi is field is so over the marshalls lines are a is what i love about good comedies never afraid to poke fun at sets were was on point and the backstabbing montana morehead was a devilish delight terri hatcher as dr monica demonico didn't have enough lines but none the less still gorgeous and fun when on screen i would love to know how the idea for this movie came up never have i seen a cast of people have so much fun in making comedy work soapdish is a must have and i am waiting for the dvd
a true classic beautifully filmed and acted reveals an area of paris which is alive and filled with comedy and tragedy although the area of hotel du nord and the hotel itself still exists it is not as gay the original sense of the word and joyful as it once must have been the film makes one yearn for the past which has been lost with a sigh and bittersweetness
i just have to say this is one of my favorite movies of all time i cannot even count the number of times i've seen it i was already in love with john travolta but the first time the camera pans up his body after all clean-shaven looking beautiful for his first trip to i was in awe debra winger as always delivers a perfect performance as the young naive wife of bud but with the necessary attitude to be married to a stubborn and hard-working cowboy if you're not a country music person which i wasn't this is soundtrack that'll have you singing right along with every word if you get a chance please see this movie-it won't disappoint
what a fascinating film even if it wasn't based on real life forbidden lies was a fascinating portrait of a con artist in her element and it is the kind of film psychology students could study to learn about compulsive author of forbidden love norma was revealed as a fraud in the media but this move really does give her ample opportunity to clear her the twists and turns she takes the documentary maker through are amazing what a patient woman i loved this movie i have not read the book but simply heard good reviews and went to see it on boring rainy afternoon the journey this film takes you on is clever interesting and totally engrossing
an adaption of the book finding fish this story is about a troubled young sailor antwone fisher luke who tells the painful story of his past to a psychiatrist jerome davenport washington a brilliant debut performance by derek luke and an always stunning performance by denzel movie was incredible on so many levels and i was disappointed that it didn't win an oscar i think it was because it was released at a bad time why it was overlooked i strongly recommend this film to everyone you'll be touched by his story and it really does make the audience become empathetic with this young man that is antwone you like inspirational true stories then watch antwone you
i got the first bill and ted movie for christmas and i had to get the second when i saw it in a store this one was think just as funny as the first but a much wierder story it was funny how they had their own personnal hell and how they had to play death the funny thing was that they played him in stupid little games like clue the only thing i'd change is station and death being in the band but other than that it was great

this movie was very good if you are one who likes to watch horror movies i recommend it the acting was very good although i thought that the actress playing julie could have had more emotion behind her lines allan was very good and i thought the cinematography was amazing i was on the edge of my seat the entire time while my friends were freaking out and screaming it was a complete success in my opinion and should have made it to the big screen i give it two thumbs up i definitely would say that if you haven't already seen it then go rent it if you have seen it and didn't like it go and watch it again because there are parts that were completely unreal i also liked how a lot of the movie was filmed around and on my campus
as if the film were not of value in itself this is an excellent way to get an overview of the novel as a preface to reading it in the summer of i saw the film in nyc that fall in graduate school i read the book for the first time some of the pleasure in reading the novel was my memory of the scrupulously detailed film and for better or i've now read and taught the novel for over three is still leopold bloom
this is the only movie i've seen prince in but it don't matter and i thought he was only great at singing boy was i wrong this is probably his best performance the music is great thats why it won the oscar in for best music to a movie something like that now he has an oscar and grammies under his belt although the cursing gets in the way with the film make sure no little kids or in the room there isn't to much to say without revealing the plot you should really go out and get this movie your collection isn't complete unless you got this movie in it what else could i possibly say except for go and get this movie now
bette midler is again divine raunchily humorous in love with burlesque capable of bringing you down to tears either with old jokes with new dresses or merely with old songs with more power punch than ever all in all singing new ballads power-singing the good ones such as the rose stay with me and yes even wind beneath my wings the best way to appreciate the divine miss m has always been libe since this is the next best thing to it i strongly recommended to all with a mixture of adult wide-eyed enchantment and appreciation and a mischievous wish for pushing all boundaries
moonwalker is probably not the film to watch if you're not a michael jackson fan i'm a big fan and enjoyed the majority of the film the ending wasn't fantastic but the first or so minutes were if you're a personally believe the first minutes are re-watchable many times over the dancing in each video is breathtaking the music fantastic to listen to and the dialogue includes many of his finest videos from bad and snippets from his earlier videos it also includes some live concert you're a big fan of michael jackson this is a must if you're not a like michael jackson steer well
the man who directed the third man also directed the who will buy sequence in oliver now that is raise my hat to carol know there are second units involved but still he had to deal with orson welles and oliver reed suppose quality will does show in the final scene with nancy avoiding spoiler everyone has to see oliver for the first time sometime how many lines do i need to people to type too much is not to be hope this counts as the line
what would you do is a question that will stick in your mind for weeks after watching the emotional brokedown palace you will also be left wondering if alice was telling the truth or not a issue that is left unresolved and rightly so this is a particularly well acted and beautifully shot film although it is slow at times its pace is reflective of the story line but a lot of the film will have you on the edge of your seat wanting to know what happens next the ending will also leave you imagining yourself in the shoes of the lead characters which are brilliantly played by kate beckinsale and claire danes bill performance is commendable too
this is my kind of film i am fascinated by strange psychotic nightmares and this movie is just that but it is also a dark comedy while i see it mostly as a there will be others who might see it as a black dramatic either way it is a fascinating descent into madness the ending caught me off guard but what an ending it leaves the viewer a lot to think performances a complex and detailed plot a great script filled with dread and dashes of humor and an eerie atmosphere make this a film worth i think that i will need to watch this several more times to pick up and understand all the subtleties that are within but it is such a film that it will be a pleasure and not a chore so to do
if you haven't seen this you do not know what you are missing the first time you do you will litteraly be in pain lying on floor throwing up from laughing so hard and having probably wet yourself as is that funny there hasn't been a single comedic performance to this date that i have seen that tops this or even comes close so many classic one liners stories and drunken uncle at the bbq gi joe mr t goony goo goo ice cream man you say any of these things to anyone who has seen this performance and i'll bet you dollars to doughnuts they will not be able to keep a straight face and will burst out in laughter or recite the rest of the dialogue from the classic shame you can't get it on out of

i really think i should make my case and have and or go and see this very atmospheric and unsettling and how they could make such a gem of a film with the very they taken from website one morning an old man wanders out into the woods in search of his runaway cat he finds instead a child without parents and a murder with no this there is no trailer but i will leave a link here to the site of the movie itself where there is a trailer which is quite unsettling so please go and check it
i saw a lot films about charles dickens christmas carol but this one is the best of all there is an atmosphere which is exactly the same as in the book the actors c scott and others are great unfortunately you can't often watch the film in germany and switzerland
a wonder one of the best musicals ever the three busby berkely numbers that end the movie are spectacular but what makes this film so wonderful is the incredible non-stop patter and the natural acting of cagney and blondell is also lovely even though she may not have been a great actress a freshness in the movie that you don't see in flicks today much less in the usually stilted films even though the plot involving the setting up of movies prologues is quite dated
this is an astounding film as well as showing actual footage of key events in the failed coup to oust chavez we are given the background picture which describes a class-divided society many of the rich it appears have a choice with the democratic choice and are willing to use the military for regime change be careful what you say in front of your servants is a revealing comment the head of the biggest oil company appoints himself as the new president with us backing and these young irish film makers have it all on camera a great film to educate young people about democracy we see transparent documentation of how media can be manipulated and force used in the interests of big business against the interests of the democratic wishes of the people riveting stuff
i've always been a big cybill shepperd fan ever since i saw her series a few years ago this film certainly shows her in her best light yet the film was so wonderfully cast and played every now and again she drops little amusing lines just to make this film one of the best i've ever seen everybody really out does themselves especially robert downey jr and cybill shepperd they really made the film come true also i loved the little bit where mavis loses her wig and she nearly dies when she falls to the floor this is film at its best
the great caruso displays the unique talents of mario lanza he shows great acting capacity and is in top form as a lyrical singer paired with dorothy kirsten soprano of the metropolitan opera indeed i dare to say that he performs some songs better than caruso a'vuchella from tosti and la danza from rossini the mgm art and music departments also did a good job this movie could be perfect were it not for the awkward presence of ann blyth we see that she is trying her best dressed in the fifties style in scenes just before unforgivable lanza deserved a better leading lady and blyth should stick to less demanding productions also notice that ms kirsten sings most of the opera duets of the film with lanza giving the wrong notion that caruso had a kind of permanent leading soprano
lars von triers europa is an extremely good film that von trier has a very stylized way to tell a story at least he did have with europa to me the whole film was like an experience even if i did see it on a small television screen even with all the tricks in my opinion this film is the most complete real and moving piece of cinema then most of the films on the top list i also think it is perhaps the scariest the most gothic and complete film around all right there are other good ones too but this one is my favorite the final scene is one of the most harrowing scenes ever
i just watched this film again and remain dismayed at the number of cynics who dismiss it as just new age pap a great film one that takes its time to develop it keeps coming close to going over the edge but never does and ultimately is meditative affecting and truer to life than most films people who dismiss its coincidences can see i was angry at the time that movies like prince of tides and bugsy i liked the latter were nominated for best picture that year alone that silence of the lambs won and this was ignored completely except for one nomination for best screenplay upon revisiting it i think history supports my initial reaction
here is the explanation screenwriter pamela katz gave me for why mvt introduced jg as a specific character in the historical record is very clear joseph goebbels was directly responsible for the release of the rosenstrasse prisoners so we needed a way to get goebbels himself into our film for a woman like lena a woman from an aristocratic family with connections it wasn't unthinkable that she would make an attempt to go to the top the idea of getting to goebbels wasn't impossible for her so that became our of you who insist on seeing an actual sex act here can read my new thread below then fire lisa huttner films for two
this movie should not be compared to the sting or other game films what makes it such a great movie experience is what it has to say about relationships deceit and trust also a fairly cutting critique of psychiatry given that the female protagonist is a shrink who is so easily deceived and then acts out in such a primitive manner in the finale has mr mamet had an unfortunate experience in therapy highly hugely recommended
all very simple jake goes to prison and spends five years with the con and the chess masters they get compassionate about his history of loss and failure and utterly misery that he lives on because of his belief in his mastery of small tricks and control of the rules of small crooks they decide to give jake the ultimate freedom from his innermost fears from what he believes to be himself for that they take him on a trip where he got to let go all the fear all the pride all the hope to be reborn as true master of his a clever movie about the journey of illumination about the infinite gambles and games that we do with and within ourselves no doubt
this movie was very very strange and very very funny all of the actors are quite real and very odd the overall look of the film was different too sort of dreamy and bleached-out which only added to the spacey fumbling weird vibe of the whole not for everyone i mean not what you would call mainstream but that is what i liked about it unlike anything i have ever seen before unpredictable with a weird rhythm and punch lines in the strangest places the kids are so heartbreakingly goofy pimply that you can't help but feel for them in other words these are far from hollywoodized versions of of which for me makes it a good thing
i have to say although i despise these kind of shows shock horror i'm a girl i feel i have to express my opinion i had seen dirty sanchez before i saw jackass and think it way surpasses jackass in terms of programme making story lines and interviews are inter weaved to create a more interesting show i saw a few minutes of jackass movie the other night and couldn't believe how poorly put together it was everything just put in a line joke after joke with no relation between anything it must have been the quickest easiest show to edit ever shockingly amateur while drinking puke isn't really my thing as far as a substantial entertainment show goes dirty sanchez is way out of league

this is an excellent documentary packed with racing action beautiful pictures and a great story the imax cameras give you a very wide perspective as a dvd movie it is perfect your hear every speaker working almost all the time the film is not speeded up and just gives you the natural feel of of course there are some sound effects added but i think they are good they give a depth to the driving scenes
all i hear about is how poorly the animation is done it may not be up to par with what everyone expects but look at it this way would you expect perfection in hell it is my belief that the animation was made dry and gritty on purpose it was great to see her character transformation in this movie considering it will probably be as close to live action as we will ever get i hope for a sequel very soon if we want live action i think we may be better off with chastity or purgatori i don't think lady death would transfer well to film but be that as it may it is my own personal belief that all the naysayers about this movie are dead wrong no pun intended
the harris wincott a bitter ex-cop goes undercover in the peacemakers after his friend is killed by their leader while there he discovers that the woman wants to run for mayor and will do anything to achieve this goal even cast is wincott is a good martial artist and good nielsen plays a sexy antagonist together another bad guy plays matthias hues also him good martial direction is fight scenes rest is ok with tony burton who plays a friend of kurt killed from cyndi pass plays a bad producers of another arts tracker with lorenzo good action best film of martial law series
i fell in love with this silent action drama kurt russell and only kurt russell could have played this so well raised from childhood to know nothing but war and fighting todd russell is dumped on a planet after being made obsolete by genetically engineered stage is set and another classic icon of action movies was born soldier not rambo not schwarzenegger not bruce willis not mel gibson not jason statham kurt russell owns this role and made it entirely his original daring and all too human i miss the fact that sequels were never faith
i had seen this film way back in the and had nearly forgotten it when i noticed it was on tv again and watched it i remembered having liked this little sleeper when i first saw it and i liked it even better on second of the actors especially robert duvall glenn close wilfred brimley frederic forrest and jason presson the twelve-year-old boy who feels responsible for the accidental shooting death of his older brother are superb the film has a very genuine feel to understated quiet deeply moving story of a family aching with grief the dialogue is sparse but telling and the nonverbal acting is outstanding sort of like a simpler rural version of ordinary people sans psychiatrist but equally impressive family stone boy is well worth the time and emotional energy involved in watching it
i was about thirteen when this movie came out on television it is far superior in action than most movies since martin sheen is excellent and though nick nolte has a small part he too provides excellent support vic morrow as the villain is sheen tests the water in his ford along the mountainous highway it is ending is disappointed in the low vote this received i figure the younger generations have more interest in much of the junk that is coming out these taste eludes the masses
a very funny movie it was good to see jim carrey back in top form it was definitely worth the price of admission morgan freeman and jennifer aniston both played outstanding supporting roles in this film i think they may have played the dog a bit too much however still a good film to see
cutting to the chase this is one of the most amazing most intense film i've seen in a long time the first movie in years that left me absolutely staggered i could barely feel my way out of the theatre i was so been staring at the screen for about fifteen minutes trying to find some way to describe the power of this film and just failing highlighting any one aspect of it the documentary-style video diary format the unflinching portrayal of the events the force of the characters just seems to trivialise it all some may find it laughable that any killer could be characterised as normal but then not all killers are raving lunatics foaming at the mouth many are quite regular unassuming people they're just wired perhaps the most chilling thought of all
this picture for me scores very highly as it is a hugely enjoyable and amusing spoof of alien invaders taking over a town and many of its men town and the players are all decked out in sort of style and the whole movie has a deliberate tacky and kitschy feel to it some of the scenes are hilarious like with the birth of an alien the actors give full blooded and serious performances which makes the film even funnier and the special effects and aliens are at least it seems to me intentionally rate to add to the type of films often deserve a cult
one of best films that i can enjoy watching often you may easily guess the outcome but who cares its just plain fun escape for hour forty-two minutes and after all wasn't movies meant to get away from reality for just a short time anyway the cast sparkles with delight
this is very nearly a perfect film the ideas would be repeated by mamet but never told so succinctly this is really about the failure of trust of the human condition the film weaves the idea that we are all criminals no one is innocent is there anyone alive today who hasn't seen this play out in our own society every single day the film is very much structured like a hitchcock thriller except there are no more innocent characters the world is now completely polluted ruined and everyone is participating in the con could anything be more miss the soundtrack it is wonderful
if only all animation was this great this film is classic because it is strong is two simple aspects story and character the characters in this film are beautifully personified i felt for all of the characters and human-animal relationship in the movie works perfectly the beautiful animation and computer animation hasn't worked better in any other film this is a great movie for kids and for adults who want a classic journey of
wow i have seen so many bad low budget films lately but this one is great the very realistic portrayal of police life in a city on the east german coast is a strong contrast to other crime movies or series i loved the main actress and the absolute rejection of any prevalent cliché about the police this film is realistic like a documentation and entertaining like a drama at the same time a perfect tradeoff
higher learning is a slap in the face for those of us that have been in the closet too long regardless of ethnic background a subject most of us would like to ignore but we cannot afford to if there is to be a real progressive change in the way we have to be able embrace and understand have criticized this film as hateful or dumb but the fact of the matter is ignorance reigns supreme in the world and several continue to help it dominate our involved in this film has done a good deed in showing what steps must continue to be done in order to not have to make anymore films like higher it sounds like a pipe dream but we have to start somewhere and this helps
buster absolutely shines in this episode which is the only vehicle i've seen towards the end of the career that allowed him to do the physical silent comedy that made him famous still a shock to hear his gravelly voice in the talkie sequences his voice is about the only thing i don't care for as far as buster is concerned but his ability to take a pratfall is still unparalleled he even repeats some of the gags used in his early two-reelers with roscoe deepest gratitude to rod serling for presenting us with this episode and for giving genius full scope he didn't have much time episode to do it in but this is a touching tribute to greatest genius
i really liked this movie i've read a few of the other comments and although i pity those who did not understand it i do agree with some of the criticisms which in a strange way makes me like this movie all the more i accept that they have got a pretty cast to remake an intelligent movie for the general public yet it has so many levels and is still great to watch i also love the movies such as this one which provoke so many debates theories possible endings and hidden subtext congratulations definitely in my top saw this when it first came out whilst i was backpacking in mexico it was late at night and i had to get back to my hotel and i had a major paranoia trip where does the dream end and the real begin
in answer to the person who made the comment about how the film drags on and who believed there was no purpose to the role of brother here is my role of brother is to provide a form of dramatic irony in the story craig could have foreseen the troubles associated with living life to the full by looking at how brother turned out there are various instances where brad pitt and his lives run in parallel for example when brother takes craig sheffer to a disjointed bar and subsequently he finds brad pitt there a few days later the dramatic irony was there so craig character would have a bigger emotional turmoil at his brothers death knowing he could have done more to prevent it and subsequently creates a more compelling mood in the film
in this film judy garland is deemed not to be ready for the big-time yet by the man who loves her-van heflin this film was certainly a big change for mr heflin especially after his supporting oscar win the year before in johnny spring byington too old to be the widowed mother of children with four of them appearing to look like her singing and dancing are just marvelously staged but the way that the blossoming romance between heflin and garland was depicted left a lot to be desired it was a gigi-like one where a young girl is eventually swept off her feet by a charmer
abc has done more for this show by allowing television veterans james garner and david spade to join the cast of this show at first the show was watchable and even predictable with john ritter and katey sagal loss shocked the world katey and the three kids are really a solid professional cast the hour lesson after death in real-life struck home to me i lost my father at years old and could sympathize and understand their pain and agony abc should be proud to maintain this show and even preserve this as final wish this show has matured and developed because of such impossible circumstances they should be rewarded with emmys
like most people i've seen jason priestley on tv and i think great but i didn't know he had a sister justine priestley is simply as the scorned other woman good music intrigue and a death scene involving revenge on an abusive dr that will stay with you for weeks i'll leave it at that kudos
this is one of my favorite mr motos and i have seen them all as usual lorre is his charming self as the debonair mr moto lionel atwill plays a delightfully zany museum curator the usual comic relief is quite funny here and there are lots of suspects on whom to cast an eye fast paced and archaeologist doesn't have quite the same flair as thomas beck the usual second lead in these programmers but adequate stepin fetchit is on board and while he speaks in a stereotypical manner his lines are funny not demeaning to his intelligence and he actually saves the day in his brief time on screen
i watched this last night on tv i have to admit that the tension in this movie was unsurpassed by most other fn era movies i loved the way chip would be all calm one moment and then violent the very next moment it was classic ahh yes the dames the villians the cigars and thuggish cops it has it all this movie delivered all the goods to me i especially loved the way they mixed communism into the plot very common for this era of movie very daring also since blacklisting was popular in those days i rate this movie one of the best i have seen in the fn genre
this film is absolutely hilarious basically the plot revolves around a serial killer being somehow turned into a snowman through some b-movie chemical accident he then heads for town and starts terrorising the locals its up to the local police chief and some other characters to try and stop him its made on a wee budget and it certainly shows but the great thing about this film is it knows that its rubbish the improvisations of styrofoam and polystyrene mimicking the giant killer snowman are classic and this is clearly the intention its one of the few films that has its budget as its main selling point alongside the comic tackiness there are some other great comedy moments listen out right in the beginning for the voice over of a dad scaring his kids to death and the funniest rape scene ever committed to film fantastic tacky fun
ray liotta and tom hulce shine in this sterling example of brotherly love and commitment hulce plays dominick a mildly mentally handicapped young man who is putting his minutes younger twin brother liotta who plays eugene through medical school it is set in baltimore and deals with the issues of sibling rivalry the unbreakable bond of twins child abuse and good always winning out over evil it is captivating and filled with laughter and tears if you have not yet seen this film please rent it i promise you'll be amazed at how such a wonderful film could go un-noticed
the early career of abe lincoln is beautifully presented by ford not that anyone alive has seen footage of the real lincoln but fonda wearing a fake nose is uncanny as lincoln with the voice delivery walk and other mannerisms exactly as one would imagine lincoln to have been ford in the first of three consecutive films he made with fonda is at the top of his form perfectly evoking early century america the story focuses on a pair accused of murder that lincoln defends and the courtroom scenes are quite well done the supporting cast includes many of regulars this was alice last film as she died months after its release
a classic series that should be at least repeated or released on realising he is adopted after the death of his on a journey to find his real various rites of search culminates in the discovery that his fathers identity was stolen and used by a human trafficker in i remember series ends on the ski slopes and a cliff top chase resulting in the death of billys fathers betrayer this series was all filmed on location in various destinations round europe and appeared polished and incredibly well made with some episodes crossing into the realms of film noir and crime main arc was often eclipsed by the slices of life that billy went through during his years of toiling to find his mother and fathers class act but underrated and forgotten
gojoe is part of a new wave of japanese cinema taking very creative directors editors and photographers and working on historic themes what the japanese call period pieces gojoe is extremely creative in terms of color photography and editing brilliant even the new wave of japanese samurai films allows a peek at traditional beliefs in shamanism demons and occult powers that were certainly a part of their ancient culture but not really explored in samurai epics or the zaitochi series another fine example of this genre is onmyoji i would place director sogo ichii as one of the most interesting and creative of the new wave japanese directors other recent japanese period pieces i would highly recommend include twilight samurai and shintaro zatoichi the blind swordsman
amazing acting music a simple and clear plot but it drew me in and kept me captivated all the way through i don't know why it was so fantastic but it simply was so many of the characters were so real it moved me and made me think i would like to watch more like idea of a school trip as a forum for such an amazing plot was a genius idea and so many of the people were like people were like those encountered every day by teachers in the film tackles issues of religion friendship memories difficult experiences and simple the diversity of life itself
it was life-changing it really man in the moon is a breathtaking experience to acting was fabulous the story line was great and this was a perfect start for reese don't see how anyone couldn't love this not the best movie ever even though it was close to it but it was highly amusing to watch and i even had a big laugh at one of the jokes and a lot of other little course there was some cry your heart out moments too but this movie was enlightening and it brightens up your day although you have to get a little depressed from the story every now and can't believe this movie didn't win at least one award and i also can't believe that been seen by so little people on this this movie if you haven't for it is definitely touching
twisted desire was a tv movie starring melissa joan hart character jennifer stanton a seventeen-year-old seduces her current boyfriend nick ryan into murdering her two parents the movie is based on the murders of the parents of year old jessica wiseman jessica had her year old boyfriend douglas christopher thomas shoot and kill her parents thomas was executed in jessica was released from prison when she turned years old evidence now suggests that it was jessica who fired the fatal shot that killed her mother jessica is known to now be residing somewhere in the state of virginia
eddie murphy delirious is easily the funniest stand-up concert film i have ever seen most stand-up acts usually have lulls at some point but not this one folks for min there is not one moment that is not side-splittingly funny from the moment eddie does a hilariously dead-on impression of the laughs are this was done in and eddie hasn't done anything nearly as funny unbelievable that the man who wrote this phenomenally brilliant show wrote a movie called harlem nights which was not very funny at if you're out there please go back and do a concert film in the vein of delirious believe me your fans will love you for it and i think you know that
good times in my opinion is a must-see cbs hit despite the fact that i've never seen every episode i still enjoy it hard to say which one is my favorite also i really love the theme song if you ask me even though i like everyone it would have been nice if everyone had stayed on the show throughout its entire run everyone always gave a good performance the production design was spectacular the costumes were well-designed and the writing was always very strong in conclusion even though it can be seen on tv land now i strongly recommend you catch it just in case it goes off the air for good
elvira mistress of the dark is one of my fav movies it has every thing you would want in a film like great one liners sexy star and a outrageous story if you have not seen it you are missing out on one of the greatest films made i can't wait till her new movie comes out
if you like film don't miss this one if you prefer action or horror or romance then you'll wonder happening everyone here is stuck in a gangster film and what happens is transcendental are few similar films no doubt it will see limited release and be hard to find but the search will be worth it if you want to study a mileu as a potential symbol then this is indeed a film to can't watch it once if you do you'll never see happening dark city is better joe vrs the volcano is more fun but mad dog time could convert the gangsta crowd to symbolism or at least to think twice before shooting again
i first saw this when they showed this around easter time and didn't think much of it then i bought this on dvd last summer when i started getting into michael jackson liked his music before and enjoyed it more now i am older it is a good film but it won't be this classic film like the sound of music west side story the wizard of oz etc michael jackson as an actor was good and so were the other cast members there were a disturbing scenes like the little girl katie getting slapped by the gangster frankie lideo who was played by joe pesci the scene that frightened me when i was younger was when michael turns into a robot my favourite song on the film was smooth criminal i think it was better than thriller in my opinion
the mystery here is why this delightful small comedy has been ignored by most critics and has failed to find the audience it deserves simply showcasing the budding talent of audrey tautou should be enough to generate greater recognition from the cognoscenti in pretension and relying on quirky characterizations itõs rumination on the interconnection of human behavior manages to be both amusing and life affirming and unlike some of itsõ more critically acclaimed competition in the genre such as the taste of others it actually entertains
this is not a movie for fans of the usual eerie lynch stuff rather for those who either appreciate a good story or have grown tired of the run-of-the-mill stuff with overt sentimentalism and oprah-ish this is such a wonderful movie you must see she is right for story unfolds flawlessly and we are taken along a journey that i believe most of us will come to recognize at some time a compassionate existentialist journey where we make amends för our past when approaching ourt inevitable is without faults cinematography likewise quite brilliant and the dialogue leaves out just enough for the viewer to grasp the details od the warm movie not excessively sentimental
i just watched antwone fisher on bravo what an awesome movie and incredible young man this movie is a must see for anyone who is dealing with how to overcome childhood abuse and abandonment as an adult denzel washington puts in an outstanding performance as well as the young man who plays antwone fisher kleenex good and tearful the most heartrending moment is when he finally meets his mother who he was taken away from at months of age and one of the most courageous was when he stood up to his abusive foster mother and sister i saw this movie on bravo in and only wish i had known about it years ago definitely a movie to add to my dvd collection
i saw this film again and noticed how close it is to the novel if we ignore the part about howard childhood considering the time not much can be shown on the screen that there is much in the novel the obsession of the character with mildred davis is very well conveyed to the audience i recommend this film to anyone who ever fell for another person and the other side tried to take advantage of him or her i have read that maugham was asked to make a recording of the novel for sale but when he started to in the studio he began crying and could not finish more than a few lines and whole project was chucked one can tell the novel is written from the heart and the film is a of a part of it at least
halloween is one of the best examples of independent film very well made and has more psychological elements to it than you might realize at first glance it is a simple movie told very well the music is perfect and is one of the most haunting scores if you haven't seen this movie yet you must check it out the cast is all terrific i wish they had never made sequel after sequel the first one was by far the best and should have ended like it did without having a sequel it was fun to see jamie lee curtis in the movie she hasn't seemed to age just as gorgeous today without the hairdo and seventies clothes the scenes through the mask are one of the scariest things ever
this is the kind of film for a snowy sunday afternoon when the rest of the world can go ahead with its own business as you descend into a big arm-chair and mellow for a couple of hours wonderful performances from cher and nicolas cage always gently row the plot along there are no rapids to cross no dangerous waters just a warm and witty paddle through new york life at its best a family film in every sense and one that deserves the praise it received
i agree with another user here and have to say that this is one of the best kung fu movies ever i watched this as a kid and absolutely loved it the scaffolding scenes are brilliant and you can really empathise with this guy because he is treated as an outcast nice humour and fantastic kung fu this movie rocks if you like kung fu you would love this
this move actually had me jumping out of my chair in anticipation of what the actors were going to do the acting was the best farrah should have gotten a oscar for this she was fabulous james russo was so good i hated him he was the villain and played it wonderful there aren't many movies that have riveted me as this one the cast was great alfie looking shocked with those big eyes farrah looking like a victim and you re-lived her horror as she went through it farrah made you feel like you were there and feeling the same anger she felt you wanted her to hurt him yet you also knew it was the wrong thing to do the movie had you on a roller coaster ride and you went up and down with each scene
come on people this movie is better than i can see this people have done crazier things than this and it was watch a comedy to be entertained escape from the pressures of the world for a short while and not to have to take anything too seriously this movie fully suits that purpose i judge a movie on its own merits and am not about to compare surviving christmas to blazing saddles i watched totally dysfunctional people grow into caring likable individuals who could easily live down the street from my home it will remain on my list of watch for the holiday season if you just want to have a fun minutes watch this one
a beautiful movie especially if you like films and the austere hungarian story of courage compassion and loyalty that transcends generations the horsemanship is spectacular as well as the main characters horse in his own will buy this movie and watch it again this is a family film and i recommend it good family nite movie although there are some violent scenes it was the nazi occupation of native people were very interesting in the way they stood their ground even in the face of certain death from a nazi officer who had his own personal reasons for hunting down hauntingly beautiful film

i saw this movie on cable it was really funny from the stereotype police chief to the stereotype big bad guys jay leno and mr mayagi from karate kid star in this good comedy about a prototype car part i compare this movie to rush hour in which a local cop has to partner up with an asian police officer to solve a case the chase through farmers market in downtown detroit brings back memories enjoyable soundtrack good script i give it
it has been almost years since the release of this stylish action have watched this movie almost times and it a great effort by my feel this movie is virtually flawless surya as acp anbuchelvan-no played her role as maya very character suits her very character that caught movie-goers attention was played the role of pandia very and deservedly received the best villain award in the itfa supporting cast of daniel and other performed dialogues and brilliant narration by soundtrack by harris jeyaraj are all chart-busters while the bgm suits the movie very by rajasekhar is hein choreographed the stunts editing is kaakha is a perfect cop film filled with right doses of action and some hollywood film cant compete with kaakha
i first flicked onto the log accidentally one night while waching television since then i have never missed an humour is very weird like a cross between brass social commentary the fast excellent one-liners and an amazing plot that seems to develop each week without ever going anywhere the best example of this was hillary special stuff what was that all humour will not appeal to all some will say just too sick and easy to see where they're coming from nonetheless give it a try if you don't like it don't watch it but if you do like it you'll be very glad you took my advice
i saw that when i was little and it was excellent kelsey white as lisa and the meecy mices where cute susan bonde as doodle and sandra dee heidecke as snoodle where hilarius karen boettcher-tate as profster was interesting burl ross as little bunny foo foo was funny gregory donavon as kaiso was brilliant whats hilarius that snoodle and doodle eat too much candy whats sad that little bunny foo foo that bops the meecy mices on the head then by a fairy will give little bunny foo foo few wishes then he turns into goon this story is about when lisa snoodle doodle go to the big rock candy mountains this show is excellent the kids will like this show new words songs and watching them playing
but it was on a uhf channel and the reception was very fuzzy i'd really like to own the movie since the reason i watched it in the first place is because i am a bus driver and at the time i saw this movie i was driving that model bus it was only his murder trial some years later that i remember vaguely that oj was one of the stars in it i only recall that he was the driver and of the bus being shot up and driven wildly i've been looking all over for this movie to no avail since viewing it in the i liked the movie i don't usually watch thrillers but after reading the summary in the tv guide and viewing its beginning fuzzy i stayed for the whole thing
evidently not many people have seen this movie because no one is posting any more comments this is not a movie to be missed after all it has won the george peabody award as well as the humanitas award paul winfield should have won an award for his awesome performance in this movie eugene logan who was a co-writer on this made for tv movie also was part of another movie on humanity or loss of it by being a technical adviser to truman movie the glass house this movie is now available on dvd if anyone is interested i will post another letter telling how it was that eugene logan came to be the technical adviser to a movie of such an amazing person as truman capote thanks for reading this and i hope you will find a way to view these two movies
the story of a drifter his sheep ranch boss and the daughter is not for all tastes but still very intriguing it takes place in the beautiful country of new zealand amongst the scenery we've come to know so well through other films from this movie was the first time i had ever seen the excellent mary regan and i've been a fan of hers ever since the cast also contains bruno lawrence who is probably best remembered by american audiences from the film smash palace terence cooper takes a turn as the ranch owner who pays a little too much of the wrong sort of attention to his daughter acted with unforgettably shattering performances from all of its leads i first saw this movie in extremely edited form on late night television here in america but believe you me the unexpurgated version is not to be missed
piece of subtle art maybe a masterpiece doubtlessly a special story about the ambiguity of existence tale in kafka style about impossibility of victory or surviving in a perpetual strange world the life is in this film only exercise of adaptation lesson about limits and original sin about the frailty of innocence and error of his kessle is another joseph k images of trial and same ambiguous woman and europa is symbol of basic crisis who has many aspects like chimeric wars or unavailing search of or parable the movie is history of evolution war peace business or lie are only details of gelatin-time hypocrisy is a mask a convention the only method to hope understanding a painful reality
along with south pacific guys and dolls is for grown-ups it is sassy sexy and full of men being men and women being strung is an energy and drive that makes this stand out from the pack the strength of jean performance and the charm of a young brando and an already masterful sinatra add much to the overall feel and look of the and dolls wins as it is unashamedly what it is an mgm good to look at and listen too with great tunes and dance numbers it will remain one of the classics of century cinema and be watched with pleasure for years to recommended
this was an excellent episode although i had never been seen the older ones i never thought the doctor would go up against anything that is paranormal extra terrestial of course but not episode brings the things that we most fear and how would we humans in a futuristic time would fight and defeat real live evil when most odds say that would be that a family film i am surprised that they brought some stuff in like fear and faith especially if its also going to entertain american audiences but who care about what yanks say we rock doctor who has shown potential ever since from episode one from the new series in first being so harmless to scary from fun to serious from light to darkness i hope many old fans will one day soon say the old doctor who has out of
best stephen king film alongside it though this one is more fun than scary got it all great cast with a alice krige and brian krause and a fun cameo from king dosed horror in an amusing use of music santo sleepwalk in characters in a typical king setting middle of nowhere of humor you can't really get good scares here because too much fun and over the but really nice makeup effects like they don't make rating i don't get it really when was the last time a horror film was as much fun as this one
when it comes to the erotic genre i'm lucky to get through the first minutes of the plot without getting up or looking for something else to watch this movie is different julie davis love you don't touch me directed two very strong lead actors kira reed and doug jeffery in this enthralling thriller kira is convincing as kim a sweet innocent romance novelist that gets caught in the web of seduction of doug the man a handsome stranger kira loses control of her inhibitions in the role and as actress giving what could have been simply another t and a depth and believability i believe it to be her best performance yet and julie davis direction is a great gift to erotica
before viewing please make sure you have seen night of the living dead this might well be the best minute parody i have ever seen absurd crappy special effects rope the rope and maneating slices of bread what more do you not watch this movie while eating bread you might get scared
such a delightful movie very heart warming one can't help falling in love with the character of gigi adorable as a child and grows into a sensitive artist the whole movie revolves around him he lives in a wonderful world living all life curiosity desire and anticipation there is an elder brother who tries to steal his glory but really remains in the shadow all his life the father is very stereotypically italian and so is the mother i wanted the father to come and reunite with the mother in the last scene and have them cry and laugh i also wish that there was at least something redeeming about the elder brother his personality seems to have been trashed entirely passion and ardour the key to life and looking through the camera focusing on small details and savoring the delicate details of life
if you like jamie from you will love his acting as a guy who never gets an even break in life and winds up messing around with shrimp size and at the same time lots of gold bars alvin sanders has plenty of fbi eyes watching him and winds up getting hit by a brick in the jaw and david clenteen hack tv series decides to zero in on poor alvin and use him as a so called fish hook to attract the criminals there is lots of laughs drama cold blood killings and excellent film locations and plenty of expensive cars being sent to the junk yard jamie foxx and david morse were outstanding actors in this film and it was great entertainment through out the entire picture
this is jackie best film and my personal favourite after the disappointing made the protector directed by james glickenhaus jackie took the concept and placed it slap bang into hong kong this is also probably jackies most violent movie with the audience cringing at the bone breaking action is fast and furious jackie and his crew really did put max effort into the fight design bones were broken and blood spilt in the process of making this film as you'll see in the script is a simple cops and robbers affair nothing special after all it was written around the action i must say that the english version has some dodgy dubbing but it shouldn't put you off too get the lads round crack open the beers and enjoy by the way the film was nicknamed glass story by the stunt crew why i'll let you find out for yourself
this is the first review i've wrote for imdb so bare with me but i caught this flick on hbo and was sure glad i watched it richard gere is great in this film as the passionate who bends the rules to get the job done i think the story is great and never a dull scene that slows the pace of the movie down some parts of the movie which have to do with demented sex addicts are pretty shocking but if you've ever seen a crime film like you'll be able to stomach the scenes just fine all in all if you're looking for a good movie ignore the low rating this movie got on imdb and definitely watch it
i saw this movie on tv when it came out and never seen it again for the life of me i couldn't remember the title and just stumbled across it while checking roy movie credits excellent dark and spooky tv horror movie in the same class as crowhaven farm don't be afraid of the dark and school for girls all lost satanic classics i also think it has many parallels to clint classic high plains drifter why don't they release these great little movies especially when you consider all of the more recent garbage that fills the discount dvd racks at wal-mart most of these flicks have a cult-following so sales shouldn't be a problem
i'm years old a guitarist and over the last forty years i've been in four bands all there the fights the foul-ups the rotten food the worse accommodation always travelling little or no money and every one was drunk or high but the clubs the fans and the music made it all worth it just like strange fruit i'm too damn old for it now and the arthritis in the hands and hips mean no more rocking but for the length of that video it all came back and it was all there the birds the brawls and the booze and i was young again just like billy voice over god likes that stuff rock on forever
although others have commented that this video is just an edited version of the two shows fire in space and living legend if you watch the original shows you'll find that dialogue from this video edition was edited out i found this video version much better because scenes and lines were added to it i would say if you want to see the show in its original version see the video versions on vhs they have more to offer the fan than the original episodes being offered on dvd now another good video is conquest for the earth which had more scenes from galactica than did the actual broadcasts themselves overall i rate this as a because it gives you more to enjoy than what the networks wanted to show in the time slot they gave the producers
rock star inxs was the best music tv series i have ever watched it had some of the greatest rock n roll songs ever written performed by very talented it also had my opinion the most heart-felt feel-good surprise endings in all of reality tv it actually made me shed tears of happiness for the winner over the weeks of this televised competition the viewing audience got to know and became familiar with all of the contestants after episodes the remaining contestants seemed more like friends than just some more strangers competing against each other on a reality tv show and the fact that inxs was and still is one of the greatest rock n roll bands ever just added to the emotional tension created by this wonderful reality series if you don't have the series recorded rock star inxs the dvd is a great alternative
i never really knew who robert wuhl was before seeing this but after seeing it i realized what a funny man he is this hbo special features him teaching american history to new york university film students and the man was just phenomenal he poked fun at almost every key historic event that occurred not just in the but some other parts of the world this was a great satire that made me question if what i accept as the infallible true history is really enjoyed how mr wuhl managed to mix useful information with great comedy and made learning a lot more exciting i would recommend this to anyone interested in history and is willing to question what beliefs
historical drama and coming of age story involving free people of color in pre civil war new orleans starts off slow but picks up steam once you have learned about the main characters and the real action can begin this is not just a story about the exploitation of black women because these were free people they may not have had all the rights of whites but they certainly had more control over their destinies than their slave ancestors the young men and women in this story must each make their own choice about how to live their lives whether to give into the depravity of the system or live with optimism and contribute to their community i enjoyed all of the characters but my favorites were christophe anna bella and marcel
had this movie been made just a few years later i would have knocked down the score a point or two because the sound quality was rather poor at times the movie appeared to be a silent film during the in-between-scenes ambient sounds are missing but given it was and a french movie this is quite forgivable especially since this also occurs in later french which time the sound difficulties should have been worked out completely as in l'atalante from apart from some minor sound problems this is a cute little film about a missing winning lottery ticket and a long list of people trying to get it and during the search there are lots of jaunty little songs that you can't help but like a nice charming film all-in-all
presenting lily mars is a real pleasant little film which showcases the comedy skills of actress judy garland along with her standard singing moments the plot consists of lily mars tagging along after producer john thornway for her big break i think the comedy is light and nothing too heavy here i really recommend this film for everyone judy is breathtaking in this role
i enjoyed this film very maguire gives a terrific performance as jake he has got to be one of the best actors i have seen and i was surprised there were so many humorous lines throughout the film he was extremely good at this too although i have never seen him deliver a comic line before the film gets you involved with the characters and really makes you wonder what is to become of them all i did not know what to expect from performance but i think she did rather well lots of exciting scenes a thoroughly good ride i am absolutely a fan of check out cider house rules one of the all time best ever
there are good ways to make a movie and bad ways and this very much the former this short caper exacts nothing more than what it gives to the audience it presents a simple story told very plainly with enough wisecracks to keep you going then just gets better and better cameo is funny and very welcome but the leads including sam rockwell and luiz guzman can easily make it on their own likeable and funny hilariously so towards the end welcome to collinwood is a welcome addition to the heist genre
despite what others had said this is my favourite movie of all time i don't know how long i had been waiting to see it but once i finally did i immediately fell in love sure strange but that just gives it more of an exciting flavour for those who don't know moonchild is one of gackt and first movies they haven't done very many at all maybe or tops each so give them some credit we all know that adam sandler wasn't the best at first either i do believe that they do throw some odd situations in there but i over look that to find the best points of this movie the emotions displayed and whatnot therefore i have given and always shall give this movie a out of
this is an almost action-less film following jack an insomniac as he goes through hallucinations is visited by dead friends throws himself off a building and for a lot of the time can't tell reality from monaghan as jack is truly believable confused and scared but lethargic and at times blankly accepting of what he sees we follow him trying to sort out what seeing and find a way to a talking dog hallucination and children that suddenly appear in bathroom and bedroom without any explanation as to how they got there hallucination and you have an interesting mind boggling minutes and the shower scene is enough to get any dom fan coming back for more
i love this thing jason steele is amazing my favorite parts are the french song and in the opening title when the spatula soldier yells spoons i crack up every time i would recommend this movie to knox klaymation fans and people who enjoy jason other movies his style of animation is very original it takes a few views to notice the detailed backgrounds his humor is also hilarious and is definitely not something you'd hear before like max the deformed spatula who has a sound and light system in his head that beams colorful lights and happy music whenever he talks about his miserable life this is a wonderful animation to watch anytime any where
a wonderful film to watch with astonishing scenes and talented actors such as misa shimizu and nagiko tono after minutes of watching your eyes get locked on the screen and you do nothing but breathing in the atmosphere of the film waiting what the destiny will bring to the characters this film makes you leave your position as a standard audience it takes you in it makes you a part of the story costumes and settings are brilliant especially the district of the okiyas is skillfully built it is definitely not very akira kurosawa however it still gets a lot from the master especially the stylistic story telling tells us we're in a distinguished land of cinema which is quite far from hollywoodish flamboyance
this alec guinness starrer is a very good fun political satire of corporate industry and a light eccentric character study as pacing is a bit slow for a comedy and none of it is really rolling-on-the-floor type funny except perhaps the sound effects for the experiments but it does have its amusing moments and it is very deft in its execution the big explosions segment is probably the most farcical union procedures are quite droll very reminiscent of i'm all right jack especially the feminine socialist with a light romantic crush on guinness character the political machinations actually carry the story ernest thesigner is very notable as a don't think this one works quite as well as the ladykillers or kind hearts and coronets but even light ealing comedy is better than nothing
caught this film in about on video by chance and without knowing what i was in for many horror fans may have missed this thinking it was a typical prison film and the ones who did get it didn't like it as it was not what they wanted to see the above mentioned factors are probably the reasons it is low rated but just ignore that and give it a whirl if you're a fan of the has strong suits in all departments from script and atmosphere to acting and the prison itself absolute diamond a film i still have on video to this day check it out
i have to agree with a great movie specially for the family kelly linch is beautiful the little girl is really talented and cute of course jim belushi has earned his strips but want i really liked was the piano song if you're a musician or not watch this movie just for that you'll know which it nobody till somebody loves you written by russ morgan larry stock and james have fun
i sincerely hope that at least the first season of cosby is released on dvd someday the episode with eccentric genius brother george by the late roscoe lee browne is classic hilarity it reflects the classic sibling rivalry and love between brothers whose lives took different paths but both ended up cosby and ms rashad brilliantly recaptured the chemistry that they shared on the cosby show for many years and to put them in a more middle-class role shows the dimensions they can take as artists roster of comedic kahn phylicia rashad and mr cosby classic genius
this documentary was interesting but it was also long long it lasts a total of minutes like ben-hur long but if your into that this is for you but only if you have a passion for movies like i do being that martin scorsese is my favorite director and maybe even ever this is quite fascinating especially if you know the style of works because then you can understand where he got his inspiration for many of his films not the best documentary film ever made but it is a leap for scorsese which is always good to watch a
i've seen this movie after watching version i've found that one a very good one and i thought this would not be as good but i was wrong british version was far better and enjoyable i found jeremy northam more agreeable than mark strong but i can say that strong catches much better knightley anyway both versions are anyone that loved books should watch this movie i agree with andrew davies changed a few things but still remains faithful to the out of cents
this is one of the best movies i've ever seen it has very good acting by hanks newman and everyone else definitely jude best performance the cinematography is excellent the editing is about as good and includes a great original score that really fits in with the mood of the movie the production design is also a factor in what makes this movie special to me it takes a lot to beat godfather but the fantastic cinematography displayed wins this contest definitely a best picture nominee in my book
a bit easy about graphics are clean and realistic except for the fact that some of the fences are but forgiveable the rest of the graphics are cleaner than goldeneye and many other games the sounds are magnificant everything from the speaking to the sfx are pleasant and camera angle is a bit frustrating at times but the same for every platform game like banjo-kazooie and donkey kong got this game as a christmas present in and since then i have dutifully gotten stars over times
this is the best series of its type i've seen all year i can't help thinking just my luck a series i love gets episodes more next year and the constant stream of cookie-cutter cop shows get never ending think the reasons new tricks succeeds are many the scripts are good and the mix of characters superb the acting is top flight and the blend of comedy and drama works a treat the stories aren't all that memorable but not the reason i watch shows like this one theme song is a favourite and we were disappointed to find it isn't available in any published edition great stuff a triumph of sense over sex-appeal from the young constable there as eye-lolly and even if he is he can still act
this show was absolutely great and i always look forward to watching the characters were funny and awesome in their own way each and every episode provided non-stop laughter and it was completely entertaining and different from a lot of other was just absolutely insane and breathtakingly funny that you couldn't help but love this were a few dead weight episodes but that show always managed to create some kind of likable atmosphere to where it just really didn't was one of the best shows to ever be aired and i will watch this show anytime i can for it never gets old never gets unfunny and never gets uninteresting
i had never seen richard thomas play a bad guy i wasn't sure i would like him this way and i wasn't sure he could pull it off but this astounded me he sent shivers up my spine and caused me to take a closer look at street people the movie is engrossing and fast paced bruce davison is convincing but all he can really play is a nice guy the real talent here is thomas the ending was a little clumsy but perhaps the way real people would fight if you are a thomas fan you must see him here at his best being bad
whenever people ask me to name the scariest movie i've ever seen i invariably reply black noon and to this day ever heard of watched it alone some years ago at the tender age of when my parents had gone out for the evening as far as i know its only ever been shown once in the uk and sadly is unavailable on dvd or anyone can trace a copy please let me i watched it again now it would probably be a big disappointment but it has always stuck in my memory as a particularly disturbing little film
this film is like an allegory of the gospel it has such direct honesty and innocence you can not possibly believe it was made after the world war when italy was ravaged and devastated and was filled with a huge homeless impoverished population it is a monument to the best qualities of the human spirit as well as to the endless creative resources of that land of inspiration is a character like idiot a modern christ finding his way in a big city he is goodness and purity fortified by love and his acts change the people he encounters as much as the miracle working dove the story is told in a natural manner and simple style yet imbued with a magic that is almost a premonition of surrealist fantasies it is one of the most inspiring uplifting movies ever made
this film is close to be my favorite piece of celluloid there is really not much i'd need or want to say here except maybe see this film and enjoy the excellent work by daniel and pascal who carries you through this neat funny and heartbreaking story about spending your eighth day your own day this film made me think seriously about how i spend my eighth day my life it appears that some of us are wasting precious time doing things we think we need to do either if pleasing a career or just consuming tv-shows and ballgames what we tend to miss is the satisfaction of being something for another person make a difference about taking room and time to be spontaneous and live now the eighth day at least that was what i got from the eighth day
i managed to see this at the new york international film festival in november with my boyfriend we were both quite impressed with the complexity of the plot and found it to be emotionally moving it was very well directed with strong imagery the visual effects were amazing especially for a short it had an original fantasy approach to a very real and serious topic this film is about a young girl who is visited by a demon offering to help her situation with her abusive father there is also a surprise twist at the end which caught me off guard this leans towards the gothic feel i would love to see this as a full feature film carrie
all i can say is if you don't fall in love with big and little edie after watching this movie then you're not human even after watching it for the first time i was hooked it is a mesmerizing experience that is difficult to describe as i'm sure other fans will attest to after watching it you will cry to think that these two wonderful ladies are no longer with us at least we have grey gardens to remember them i think we all long to possess the fierce independence these two ladies were graced with although i have always admired jackie onassis kennedy she does not stay in your heart the way big and little edie do what a rare treat to have know such people i only wish i had
when reading a review from another user saying that a terrible game i could not stand idle and do this game is great from the news clips two real persons full of humour sense and credibility to the story i find it very good i only complain about the enemies start blinking when they die until they disappear and some frustrating situations on the leila vr missions when riding the bike here and that a great game with a great story good graphics excellent characters great soundtrack i recommend it surely it can be a bit old but still enjoyable at least on the dreamcast but the version shall be the same
in my opinion a guy thing is a hilarious witty sexy romantic and totally beautiful chick flick that guys will also enjoy i thought that jason lee and julia stiles dazzled as a bewildered groom-to-be and his soon-to-be sexy cousin-in-law if you ask me they lit up the screen like magic you can also feel their chemistry between them before i wrap this up i'd like to say that the performances were top grade the direction was flawless the production design was nice the casting was perfect and the costumes were perfectly designed in conclusion to anyone a fan of jason lee or julia stiles i recommend this movie you're in for lots of laughs and thrills so go to the video store rent it or buy it kick back with a friend and watch it
the critics are dumb this movie is funny and smart i loved this movie a lot why does everyone hate this movie so much i wish people would love this movie more than they don't ben stiller and jack black are true comedians and they put through a lot of work to make this movie i don't see you people out there making movies like them so people should just watch it and not comment it i like this movie it is ok through it all there are parts were it dumb but at least they made it jerry stiller would love this because this movie has the acting just like the show king of queens but this is better than that i can't believe this was rated so low
when i think about this movie all the adjectives that come to mind somehow relate to the physical appreciation of the world texture smell color how i think this movie should be judged in terms of see the rich golden tones surrounding the young concubine asleep by the fireplace or the sweltering turkish bath and let it flood your senses with impressions of spice coarse cloth smooth skin scented oils flickering flames satin rustle don't just watch and listen be absorbed let the droning voice of the storyteller mesmerize you
given the low budget and production limitations this movie is very good it is plausible realistic and shows how the csikos horsemen who lived on the plains risked their lives to save a downed american pilot from the ruthless and savage nazis we are drawn into strong feelings for the young impressionable yet highly courageous admires the american pilot if you're looking for special effects superman heroes and magical movie is not for you if you want to feel what it must have been like to dodge the persistent amoral nazis and their lack of compassion then you will be enthralled by this movie i truly enjoyed it and for those who love horses dogs and humble helpful people who value freedom and those who aspire to that end this movie will be one you'll remember for a long time
this slick and gritty film consistently delivers one of best and most underrated films and easily the best elmore leonard adaptation to date if you are scratching your head thinking but i loved get shorty you need to be punched in the face in my opinion no one captures the feel for characters better then john glover in pick-up the relocation of the story from detroit to hollywood elevates the sleaze factor to amazing heights be a man have a few beers and watch this movie for reference purposes my favorite leonard books are swag rum punch cat chaser city primeval and pick-up my favorite frankenheimer films include seconds and the manchurian candidate i also have a real special place in my cold movie heart for dead bang and black sunday
one would have to be very jaded indeed not to be swept up into this gem of a film i've seen hundreds of hindi and bollywood movies too the actors the beautiful settings locations and surroundings the deep emotions portrayed the sweet songs the singing voice of udit narayan my favorite everything was just lovely the human element was also woven in to create some drama and drive the plot as well as allowing a heartfelt resolution alok nath is such a terrific actor so open with the emotions of the characters he portrays he almost steals the show from the young stars i highly recommend this film to anyone who loves true romances ones that go beyond superficial beauty to real love as one of the best films out there hindi or otherwise
mating game is a charming wonderful movie from an era gone by hollywood needs to consider a charming remake of this movie my wife and i would go see is an excellent romantic comedy that my wife and i watched on movie has tony randall at his best debbie reynolds is great as always it we plan on ordering on dvd to add to our growing collection of bad hollywood does not make movies like this to dig some of these type of scripts out of the old safe update them a bit spoiling the original movie and script as you have done with other remakes and hold a casting remake would be a big hit on the silver screen dvd and on austin tx
i have not seen this movie at least not in its entirety i have seen a few haunting clips which have left me gagging to see it all one sequence remains in my memory to this day a convincing looking spacecraft is orbiting the dark side of the moon the pilot releases a flash device in order to photograph the hidden surface below him the moon flashes into visability and for a few seconds there it is parallel lines squares could it be then the light fades and the brief glimse of what has gone and it is time for the spacecraft to return to earth wonderful i have seen some other clips too but would love to obtain the full movie

mary tyler moore and valerie harper still can turn the world on with their smiles the combined talent of these two wonderful stars make this combination movie work watch it and look forward to hitting sixty mary defies the youth oriented society with wit and charm a touch of drama adds realism a tv series follow up would broaden the new characters and give us a chance to occaisionally see lou grant phyllis sue ann murray and georgette
rarely do i see a film that i am totally engrossed with this was one of them it had good acting dialogue plot and the scenery was beautiful i laughed out loud many times especially the scene dealing with the kitchen raid the slapstick comedy performed by the lunkhead hired hand had me one the floor but i admit that i am a sucker for slapstick the story dealt with a group of people in their coming back to a summer camp that they had attended years previously it was a farewell week of camping as the place would be closed down permanently at the end of the season as adults the camp looked different and they felt differently about it and each other i recommend this funny moving movie to
i was especially delighted that in this movie othello himself was dark-skinned and desdemona didn't have fair hair like almost always the cast played very well too and i liked the script following original text so faithfully but i must say some scenes were acted too erotically for such a character as desdemona i have always thought she is very modest and why it is not proper at all to show her in bed with cassio although it was happening only in imagination at first i was a little surprised even that a love scene between othello and desdemona was shown so openly but as a whole i liked the film and especially desdemona crying in the dying scene
this movie is a lot of fun what makes it great especially are two things one is the straightforward way the characters embrace the stereotypes with discussions of their costumes and superpowers an endearing earnestness to the parody very appealing the second is basic sweetness of the characters and the quality of the chemistry claire forlani deserves particular note as the object of mr desires a boatload of talent here i realize some with high expectations may have been disappointed but this movie is a lot of fun and kind of sweet
this film is the most cult movie on metal there is premise a kid gets a hold of the final recording of his favorite artist sammy curr who recently dies in a hotel fire he plays it backwards and summons him back from the dead to get revenge in the name of heavy metal on those jocks who torment him any fan of true metal will enjoy this movie and if you are a metal head being tormented by jocks play a sammy curr album wait he is fictitious well get a hold of this movie and watch it with your fist in the air your head banging and the volume at
this is one of the best movies it is one of my favorites a movie with good acting the story is very sensitive and touching good camera work names of the actresses and actors are not at the top of the american star list however they give equal or better performances than the top of the is such a pleasure to see a movie about true love romance friendship without having to endure watching someone having to kick-box their way to save the you don't like this movie then you have no heart or feelings then go watch a sports movie there is no killing or horror here see the movie it is a must th
another powerful chick flick this time it revolves around diana gusman who is always getting into fights at school instead of getting expelled she takes her anger elsewhere to the boxing ring she trains to be a boxer and there she meets featherweight adrian and begins to fall in love with him this movie has a powerful message of taking your dreams and going with them even if someone doesn't believe in you this case her dad doesn't believe in her that alone makes the movie worth the price enjoy
i saw this kung fu movie when i was a kid and i thought it was so cool now i am years old and my friend has it on got a case of brew and watched this classic it lost none of original kung fu coolness if you are a fan of kung movies this is a must see the dvd is available i believe this movie is also called pick your it soon
gojoe takes a little getting used to at first but the final result is very satisfying the tale about a murderous samurai who seeks to redeem himself by opposing an effeminate but dangerous samurai is worth more than a watch there is a lot at stake here from physical survival to soulful salvation the movie may seem a bit similar to other anime-inspired samurai film at first but it does eventually delve into more territory soon to be missed gojoe is one of the better samurai movies to come around out of to for a more detailed review of the movie and reviews of other foreign films
still crazy is without a doubt the greatest rock comedy of all-time it has been erroneously compared to this is spinal tap which it has no relation to spinal tap is a satire quite frankly not a very good one in spite of outing of many rock clichés unlike tap still crazy is populated by great actors great songs and great human situations you care about the people in still crazy all that matters oh yeah the pretty damn good too written by mick jones of foreigner and chris difford of squeeze american audiences were already familiar with stephen rea crying game but would only later become familiar with bill nighy love actually pirates of the caribbean ii and timothy spall harry potter movies
excellent pre-code amoral tale with barbara stanwyck as the newly inspired writings of nietzsche to drive out her sensitivities and exploit herself use men to her advantage not really fair on the german philosopher but interesting that this was the year hitler came to power stanwyck even in this young version doesn't do a lot for me but she certainly performs well here ever driving herself and the film forward not as much flesh on display here as one might have expected but plenty of risqué situations and astonishing quips and innuendo great fun if not a particularly attractive presentation of men and i suppose in all honesty not a very attractive view of the gold digging female still life
this movie is great this movie is beautiful finally a movie that portrays moslems as people no stereotypes here this movie is driven by the story by the acting and above all by its theme that of cultural affirmation and discovery they may seem like clichés but they are not at least not in this movie the vista of the grand mosque of mecca is absolutely stupendous and the audience is given a glimpse of a side of the moslem world that is rarely of ever shown in the west here the people are caring supportive devout tolerant and devoted to each other what a welcomed and way overdue departure from the usual negative portrayals of arabs outstanding movie
i have not seen each and every one of movies but this is for sure the best one i have seen so story in it self is nothing special really so i go deeper into that what makes it special is the stunts the fighting the good acting the warm sense of humor the movie has a raging tempo all the way through and you are just stunned seeing it all the cool stunts course made by jackie you want jump around in the couch and scream just awesome even my mom was impressed by this cool movie when she saw know this police story can be a bit hard to get a hold of at least it is here in sweden but i can assure you worth a try
yeah it is in fact somewhere in my top all time favorite movies number i think anyways i'm usually not one for plots but i think plots work better in anime and rpg video games fantasy for example and not movies but this one has it all vivid drawings of planets stars an extremely well written screenplay while this is not really for children they can still watch it it contains no graphic blood guts and silicone but i don't think they're going to understand it
uncompromising look at a suburb in century vienna mixing the stories of six groups of characters by former documentary maker is a provocative minimalistic and intense piece of observation the world-wide spread of big brother reality shows hundstage takes modern voyeurism to an unsettling profound level hard to like but unignorable piece of european art-cinema might seem cruel and seedy yet manages to convey the nihilistic alienated feeling of modern society in a praiseworthy must for lovers of world cinema
this movie was more of a passage into manhood for one gay man and how he must deal with everyone his mother is depressed his younger sister is a pain his older sister is somewhat accepting the relationship looks good with his and he leaves his family to try life with this first guy unfortunately the new guy screws around on him and says it really didn't mean anything our young gay man goes bonkers and ends up in the looney bin and eventually leaves dumping his new lover and starting over we are left with him starting over and viewing not participating in happiness so maybe things will go better for him in the future the ending was kind of a downer but the whole movie was entirely realistic and so i will let this real ending slip bye with a high rating
after watching the rather sloppy spy thriller madam lili julie andrews on tv this afternoon i suddenly thought i had seen a far superior spy thriller all i could remember was that it was produced by dino de laurentis it only took a short search on imdb to find fraulein doktor once i recognised the title the memories came flooding back it is for its time a reasonably well crafted story revolving around true events such as the death of kitchener and the german offensives of also has a female spy who is much more believable than julie andrews as with other reviewers the first and strongest memory was of the well produced battle scenes and of men and horses in gas masks if you have an interest in war films and particularly it is a film well worth seeing if you have the opportunity
disney might just be on to something here first they had remember the titans with denzel a story based on truth involving sports and a small town in middle america now with quaid and the rookie yet another sports story based on movies move you to tears at times and both make you smile and feel all warm after seeing them my wife and i took in the rookie and we expected it to be a great feel good type movie we were not let down when asked if we'd be buying this on dvd when it comes out it was a no-brainer most definately
well after long anticipation after seeing a few clips on the scariest movie moments i had long awaited to see this film the plot was simple beautiful model alison parker raines moves into an apartment building a gateway to hell the sentinel is a down right creepy film even if a bit slow a mix of the omen and baby the acting is fine and there are some truly disturbing bits such as the awkward orgy scene with the dead father and the chubby woman in the middle of the orgy eating cake and laughing the ending is a weird mix of deformed people and cannibals a very odd campy but in the end i truly believe a great film one of my favorites from the even if nothing greatly original wacky and extremely creepy probably one of my all time favorites
i think this movie would be more enjoyable if everyone thought of it as a picture of colonial africa in the and rather than as a story because there is no real story here just one vignette on top of another like little points of light that don't mean much until you have enough to paint a picture the first time i saw chocolat i didn't really get it until having thought about it for a few days then i realized there were lots of things to get including the end of colonialism which was but around the corner just no plot anyway one of my all-time favorite movies the scene at the airport with the brief shower and beautiful music was sheer poetry if you like exciting movies don't watch be bored to tears but for some of you you can thank me later for recommending it to you
jim carrey is good as usual and even though there are quite a few jim carrey moments definitely not a jim carrey targeted mostly at children and i managed to enjoy it as such movie it was promoted in israel as another jim carrey movie so those who expected a weird over the top comedy were movie has nice moments and works well as a movie for kids i can't say i loved this movie but then again i'm not its target audience
what great locations a visual challenge to all those who put their eye behind the little jewel is an amazing account of what you can shoot in just days good going folks i can not wait to see what your next feature will be i'll be with you all the way
one of my favorite shows in the after the first season it started going downhill when they decided to add jean bruce scott to the cast deborah pratt was wonderful and it was fun watching her and ernest character go at it with each other the last episode she appeared in was one of my favorites for in the second season unfortunately during those days blacks did not last long on television shows some of the episodes in the second season where okay but the third season it was more about the human characters than airwolf and it was not shown until almost at the end of the show when it went to usa it was disgusting
i absolutely loved this movie i am not even sure what particularly about it but i think it was wonderful and should be available for dvd the women were strangers and yet got along well enough to spend the time they did in the villa in italy the actors in my opinion did an excellent job the characters were all so different and yet clever story that made it work there is humor drama and relationship issues all in good time this requires lines but i just can't think of any more to say so i will just rattle on until i get lines so sorry about this what else can i possibly say it has been a long time since i last saw it i am looking forward to view again but it isn't available
the color purple is truly amazing there is none like it and i don't think there ever will be a roller coster of emotion and pain that the viewer takes on the actors are flawless and the directing is superb i absolutely loved it a movie has never made me so happy it is beautiful the best way to explain it
wow a truly fantastic trip movie that has tons of super-surreal imagery dark intent and a black pretty strange sense of how cartoon animals must see the world populated with a very cute off-world bunch of characters that bend and flow with warped with all cool fantasy the wandering plot is secondary to the eye-popping visuals and we follow a little cat and his zombie sister as they encounter death deluge water elephants samurai swordsmen and pigs that fish i'd never heard of it but now i love it probably because it reminded me of the surreal pencil-work of american cartoonist bill plympton a demented delight for fans of odd pretty things and it had me glued to the screen for fear i'd miss something amazing simply put hello kitty without the o
few movies can be viewed almost years later yet remain as engrossing as this one technological advances have not dated this classic love story special effects used are remarkable for a movie the acting is superb david niven kim hunter and especially roger livesey do an outstanding job the use of black and white color adds to the creative nature of the movie it hasn't been seen on television for years so few people are even aware of its existence it is my favorite movie of all time waiting and hoping for the dvd release of this movie for so many years is in itself a matter of life and death
a journey of discovery this film follows the lives of one family living in a sleepy island town in british columbia languorous and dreamy the inhabitants are satisfied to allow life to go on around them until a young fresh-faced teacher with new ideas arrives and brings with her life from the mainland slowly their indolent state is awakened the father principal of the local school looks for excitement the mother for stability the oldest daughter for love and the youngest for power while not an incredible or ground-breaking piece of cinema the movie is quietly enjoyable and good for a tired night when the wind is blowing unfortunately i doubt anyone outside of canada will find it easily accessible
i watched this movie after watching practical magic and the older film was far superior i liked the way the lighting makeup and costumes changed as gillian changed in the story jimmy mannerisms didn't do a lot for me in this film but i suppose they did serve to highlight the reserve of character i was also struck by and was as if the director wanted him to appear effeminate and gillian to appear masculine the gestures nicky makes when showing redlich his powers especially struck me i've never thought of warlocks as being effeminate so it was an interesting way of contrasting those characters
touching and sad movie portrays the trials and tribulations of a writer trying to come to terms with paralysis caused by a cycling accident the film centers on his relationship with his married lover whom he is often very hostile towards and his interactions with other accident victims particularly a black down-and-out and a white-supremacist biker the film is often humorous often sad and always believable get out the box of kleenex and watch this on a cosy sunday afternoon with your partner
i must admit at first i wasn't expecting anything good at all i was only expecting a cheesy movie promoting and image but i'm glad to say it has much more to the acting is not that great but it doesn't suck either all the well disciplined and they bring enough strength to their characters effects lack consistency but action scenes are satisfying really hooked me up was the essence of the storyline although it merges fantastic elements it also displays a crude reality the developing of the characters their doubts and their feelings really got on to me and i think the key of this movie it puts you to think and it does well transmitting all the fulfills any expectations for a good drama i would definitely recommend it to everyone
my favorite imperialism movie and one of the best action-adventure flicks of all time grant mclaglen and fairbanks dominate the screen with daring-do and wise cracks to please all but the most pc of film goers memorable scenes abound the sergeants and their sepoys fighting off hundreds of thugs macchesney cutter giving bobby coote the spiked punch some for the elephant cutter to macchesney i'm an expedition din breaking cutter out of jail with a fork do you think i'm trying to break out of a bleedin pudding and the incredible temple scene with cutter singing and then annoucing bold as brass all right you're all under could go on but suffice it to say i try to catch this film whenever it is on for armchair adventurers and generals hard to imagine a better hours
this is a very fine and poetic story beautiful scenery magnificent music score i've been twice in japan last year and the movie gave me this typical japanese feeling the movement of the camera is superb as well as the actors it goes deep into your feelings without becoming melodramatic japanese people are very sensitive and kind and all very well brought onto the screen here the director is playing superb with light an colors and shows the audience that it is also possible to let them enjoy a movie with subtle and fine details once you've seen this movie you will want to see more from the same director a real feel good movie and i can only recommend it to everybody
if you like plot turns this is your movie it is impossible at any moment to predict what will happen next nothing is as it appears or ends as you think it will the characters are all gritty and engaging cage is at his best dennis hopper again shows his delightfully sinister side jt walsh is perfect in his last performance laura boyle sizzles dwight yoakum makes a film debut superbly in a cameo i categorize this movie as i am having a really really really bad day film not a slow minute in this film a real sleeper this movie is underrated and sadly overlooked
well i come from bulgaria where it s almost impossible to have a tornado but my imagination tells me to be very very guy sawa has done a great job with this don't know exactly how old he was but he didn't act like a child about the tornado-it wasn't very realistic but frightens you want to have a nice time in front of the telly this is the movie
while i suppose this film could get the rap as being anti-vietnam while watching it i didn't feel that such was the case as much as the film was simply an honest look into the perspective of the young guys being trained for a war that the public didn't support it showed their fear their desperation their drive all of it out in the open naked as a soldier myself alot of the themes rang true to me in my experience in the military especially boot camp on the whole this movie although it was shot on a very small budget looks great is very well put together and features excellent acting and directing i highly recommend this film to anyone looking for another excellent colin farrell film
and i absolutely adore isabelle blais she was so cute in this movie and far different from her role in quebec-montreal where she was more like a man-eater i think she should have been nominated for a jutra i mean syvlie moreau was good but isabelle was far superior imo pelletier has done fine work for his first time out and i noticed he snuck in a couple of his buddies from rock et belles oreilles guy a lepage andre ducharme it was fun to see them in this i didn't know they were going to don't think i've seen a romantic comedy from quebec that i didn't like and this one is as good as any i've had the pleasure to see and if you're in the states and wondering how you can get a copy of the dvd delivered it to me in less than a week
loved this acting smart dialog great storyline with real bring it back or make it available miss it hope davis really shines in this show i like the idea of six degrees it really makes sense in this insane world rid yourself of those stupid reality shows and give this show a second chance please bring it back not to please when it went off the air i watched in online and liked how i could watch it with minimal interruptions in fact online abc makes it easy to enjoy shows when you miss them on prime are the days of endless taping anytime you want to bring it back i am ready
this is one of the best jodie foster movies out there and largely ignored due to the general misconception of it as a teen flick it has wonderful performances particularly a fight scene between jodie and her mother played by a convincing sally kellerman the three girls that play friends are somewhat amateurish but i do think it is worth seeing
i've just read the most recent remarks about this movie and i would like to respond you're probably not familiar with the original story of rap group which dates back to the beginning in in ice cube left the band to go solo and ultimately in the band breaking up when left which led to a lot of beef starting with the departure of ice cube and in this story was somewhat based on more this movie was a minute laughing spree the way they explained the bootie juice song to be a political statement was hilarious not to mention the love song tasty was hooking up and when vanilla sherbert got his ass kicked just like the record company executive is also hilarious and having they're managers getting shot every time who didn't enjoy this movie probably didn't get it or were complete idiots my opinion
i was born in most of my childhood memories are in the extreme late and i watched the groove tube for the first time in when i was i found it for anybody who thinks that something dated can't be quite funny years again funny even if you have no idea what the were like and the thought of bell-bottom pants make you cringe who can argue with a bozo the clown type who reads adult literature there is plenty to laugh at the scrotal puppet show at the end is the best
scanners ii the new order is just as good as david classic scanners scanners was made in and scanners ii in so an eleven year gap between the two movies the film captures the style of scanners which is a good thing it wouldn't be scanners without a head explosion so scanners ii has a head explosion scene just has gruesome as the first scanners ii the new order has some other imaginative gory scenes that are done well the plot to scanners ii the new order is a new take on the series since it has the scanners being used as a vigilante force for a police chief and a group of scientists until a young scanner named david kellum discovers being used and decides to get ii the new order is a great sequel to david sci-fi classic scanners and should be seen check this out
ralph and mumford misfits in their own land get duped into being unwitting pawns of synanomess botch twice upon a time is the story of them the characters they meet and their struggle to set things right with a surprisingly impressive soundtrack and wonderful voice acting by some of the best in the business this offbeat movie hits the animation process while similar to that of the cut out south park style is much smoother and far more three-dimensional if i didn't know that the animation was this style i would swear that is was traditional pen and ink if you can watch this film in dolby surround or thx please do you won't really miss anything if you don't but if you do you will get much more out of the experience
i am actually outraged at the comment i read stating that this movie was boring and the beautiful scenery was marred by the black and white footage it was made in i think it absolutely incredible for time journey that these people had to go through is utterly remarkable it took them a week just to cross a river the women carried their children in heavy wooden cradles on their backs climbing up a solid sheet of rock sometimes barefoot in the snow i would like to see anybody do that now thought it was a wonderful film with some truly amazing shots and an incredible story
well when before i saw this film i really wasn't sure whether it would be my cup of wrong i was i thought that this was one of the best films i've watched for a very long time a real family classic the story of a young evacuee and his new foster dad this film ticks all the boxes i've not read the book a good thing meant i enjoyed the film more but with regards to the story i really can't think of any bad points hence scoring it out of i hardly ever think anything warrants top marks by the time william proclaimed i can ride my bike dad i was sobbing my heart out seen it will understand i'm sure really heartwarming and definitely recommended
i went to this movie at a cast and crew show cause my friend whom is a producer on the movie invited me forget what you have seen in the commercials forget what you have heard go see this film for yourself i was more than surprised by it in a world of the grinch charlies angels the day unbreakable here comes a film that is worth your hard earned bucks glorious scenes wonderful cinemtrophy and a cast you want to eat with your heart i found this to be one of this years most orchestrated powerhouse films and with reason robert deniro deserves an oscar nod if you could give an oscar to everyone involved as a package this would be the film
i went into this movie after having read it was a drama about a man with a supernatural gift who was made into a monster by society suffice to say i was expecting something entirely different from what i got but it was a happy surprise my friend and i both thought the movie was very romantic fact that the male lead isn't bad to look at surely helped and there was enough plot development action and even humor fact that it takes them until the part of the movie to now each name had the whole movietheatre laughing to keep you entertained and invested in the story so in short not what i expected but a very good surprise indeed i'll definitely buy this movie when it comes out on dvd
the season finale sent mix messages i felt feelings of joy and also feelings of being lied to and deceived roseanne tells all her viewers that the entire season nine was a lie because her husband dan had died she also admits the family never won the lottery and what season was a lie just being how she wished or wanted it to be i'm still confused about when she said becky ended up with david and darlene with mark because becky and mark admit to being pregnant so i believe that is just how she wanted it to be but it wasn't so the season finale was good but sent mixed feelings i will always be a fan of the show
this movie reminded me that some old black white movies are definitely worth the i had some reservations however from the beginning of the movie until the end i was captivated i was very impressed with the mixture of drama suspense askey gander is hilarious and had me in stitches the whole add this movie to your movie-night for some light relief from the sometimes depressing and too powerful or overly funny movies of today
i love this movie as a kid this was one of the first movies i saw that made me flinch sure it is mild now but back in the day it was awesome dentists are one thing so many people fear so why not do a movie about a killer dentist cheesy fun sometimes scary but it is awesome and i have always had a love for medical horror and corbin bernsen plays dr feinstone perfectly no one could have done it better and for a low budget horror film the effects and such are quite good and i also love the theme music it goes well with the film ken foree of the dead is also in this one playing a nosy cop and does a fine job there is a fair amount of blood and some really cool scenes check this one out
this was a fine example of how an interesting film can be made without using big stars and big effects just tell a true story about the struggles of two african american women over a turbulent movie challenges us all to look at our own personal prejudices and see that people are people not white black movie with a good message
excellent film that reveals how people are connected to the taken for granted ordinary beads exchanged during mardi gras the film is much more than a commentary on globalization in fact it humanizes the workers in china the owner of the factory the bead distributor in new orleans and even the revelers in new orleans what stands out the most is the ability to tell a tricky story with complicated details in such a simple and seductive way his amazing access to the factory is another aspect intriguing and i only wish i knew how he got inside a beautiful story without sentimentality or guilt associated with it and the conclusion provides hope without leaving people feeling alienated
it starts slowly showing the dreary lives of the two housewives who decide to rent a castle in italy for the month of april but don't give up on it nothing much happens but the time passes exquisitely and there are numerous sly jokes favorite is the carriage ride in the storm which i find hilarious the movie is wonderfully romantic in many senses of the word the scenery is beautiful is polly walker and the resolutions in the movie are very movie takes a couple of liberties with the book the biggest being with the business but i actually preferred the version of this may be more sentimental but i felt that it was more consistent with the tone of the story and anyway i like sentiment when well excellent movie especially as a date movie during lousy weather
this could be difficult to for some people to get into being used to hollywood production styles the directing is uninspired apparently simply a filming of the stage set-up and the audio quality is bad here and there rustling of clothes occasionally competes with their voices friends and i started watching without knowing what to expect and the first scene almost put us off it seemed very stagy and cheesy then we picked up on the tone of the content and really started to enjoy is very funny despite some corniness definitely give it a chance if you appreciate great dialog also helena bonham carter is adorable of course
police story brought hong kong movies to modern day plays a policeman who tries to catch some drug dealers and at the same time take care of a young woman from the bad guys and still take care of his relationship with his girlfriend selina movie features plenty of stunts not only from jackie but also from other actors are now in jackies stunt of stunt members went to hospital during filming on the movie also have some incredible fights scenes like the car park fight and the shoppingmal fight ranks as one of movie also won award for best movie and best action design by jackie chan at hong kong film who loves jackie chan martial art movies shud see this
i really liked this was cute i enjoyed it but if you didn't that is your fault emma roberts played a good nancy drew even though she isn't quite like the books the old fashion outfits are weird when you see them in modern times but she looks good on them to me the rich girls didn't have outfits that made them look rich i mean it looks like they got all the clothes at a garage sale and just decided to put it on all together all of the outfits were tacky especially when they wore the penny loafers with their regular outfits i do not want to make the movie look bad because it definitely wasn't just go to the theater and watch it you will enjoy it
i only wanted to see you laughing in the purple rain this is an excell film it should have been re-rated to but anyways first film and greatest the follow-up sucked but i haven't seen for years so what i can remember about it the kid has to juggle with winning over the love of his life apollonia keeping his band together revolution as themselves and the tension in his family but his rival band time as themselves is ruining his life like morris is trying to steal apollonia from the kid just like saturday night fever flashdance and mile really good rent it laugh and cry and if you luv it buy it
a sweet funny story of people crossing paths as they prepare for their weddings the ex-cop writer and the public school teacher fall for each other in this great new york setting even though they are marrying other people maybe a little trite in that the partners are both type a personalities while our protagonists are much more relaxed not anything heavy but it made me smile and hey for the guys sell the natasha henstridge angle and the gals sell them the sappy romance everyone wins
i've had this movie on tape for years and started watching it again this morning waiting for my laundry how ironic mostly because i wanted to hear benjamin title music again i ended up sitting through about the first half hour entranced by how wonderfully assured the direction writing and performances are the movie is like a who of british character stars cecil parker michael gough miles malleson duncan lamont and particularly ernest thesiger great as the dessicated old giant of the textile mills not to mention alec guinness and joan greenwood not character players as such but charming charismatic leads this is science fiction in its purest form and droll comedy as well an all-time classic and i hope no one ever tries to remake it
excellent view of a mature woman that is going to lose everything the pruner has a mortgage the way she gets involved into this special business the innocence and the true love that exists between the people of a little town mixed perfectly to give us as result a fresh light and funny comedy i couldn't stop laughing with a very funny scene of two old ladies in a love european films and with movies like this one my opinion grows stronger a movie that i also recommend with my eyes closed in this same genre is waking ned grace a comedy that many friends enjoyed as much as myself you will love it
this is an extremely-powerful based-on-a-true story film that can be infuriating to watch i say that because how brutal a hounding press can be to people in this case an innocent australian couple charged with killing their streep received a lot of recognition for her performance when this film came out but i thought sam neill was just as good just say they both were excellent but the role was little harder for streep because she had to learn an australian accent learned it so well i had trouble understanding her in giving anything away all i can say is this movie will wear you out emotionally
magic isn't too strong a word for the spell this film weaves you find yourself relaxing and seeing others in a more benevolent light any movie that has that civilizing an effect on viewers deserves serious attention seldom are we soaked in beauty like this as if that weren't enough funny performances are without exception extraordinary but special mention must be made of the miraculous miranda richardson and the superb josie walker both open like isn't this film on dvd it deserves to live forever
i have very fond memories of this film as i saw it with my two younger sisters when it first shown theatrically in and i was eight years old apparently it was deemed a failure and is now practically forgotten pan-and scan videocassette which never did justice to the picture or ambitious panavision compositions is now out-of the film is very stylized of yellow submarine and admittedly uneven some of the characters and sequences are exquisite while others are somewhat juvenile and undistinguished the sad discarded blue camel of eeyore and his blue song are truly heartwarming joe songs are for the most part simply beautiful definitely a worthwhile curiousity that will probably fall into total obscurity
everyone is either loving or hating this film i am going with loving it is so well shot and so well acted beautiful this film is for people who appreciate well crafted film making if you are not a fan of well done films of course you would hate this but if you like the tops of acting photography story and development look no further then here
dan katzir has produced a wonderful film that takes us on a roller-coaster ride through a real romance set in the troubles surrounding modern anyone ever been in love the film brings back the uncertainties the insecurities and heartache that make love so bitter-sweet the atmosphere of fear and isolation that came with the difficult times in israel at that time just serve to intensify the feeling instantly you are drawn in to plight and you can't fail to be deeply can't write drama and passion like this the contrast between the realities of desperate snatched relationship with iris and the realities of a state in turmoil make this eminently watchable if you have an ounce of passion and have ever been in love see this film
this is best comedy i ever seen but not all can understand this you must be from georgia to understand this amazing movie overall one of best film i ever seen and all supporting actors playing very very good but acting of kote daoshvili germogel is for my opinion best acting in supporting role in history of films in this movie playing many georgian stars like ipolite abashidze they all are stars in georgian cinematography plus in this movie is playing great russian star evgeni leonov and of course director of the film georgy danelia is one of the best i recommending this movie for everyone but remember you must know good russian language to watch this movie
john halloween is quite frankly a horror masterpiece it tells the immortal story of escaped mental patient michael myers who returns to his hometown on halloween night to stalk and kill a group of was the first and without doubt the best in the halloween franchise carpenter shows great restraint in pacing the story very slowly and building likable characters unusual for a horror more unusual is the non-existence of blood and gore and yet it remains the scariest halloween to date get that marked the film debut of jamie lee curtis and a defining point in the late great donald career a true classic
an excellent depiction of one of the more unwholesome aspects of that era i loved the fitting for a story connected to a graphic thought tom hanks was really great in this he came across very well as someone who has been hardened by his work he didn't fully choose for himself but still wants to have a normal life for his family he does the best he can to see that happen don't want to spoil the you have to see this movie if you are a person who wants more from a movie than the usual shoot em up format is violent though
this movie has so many wonderful elements to it the debut performance of reese witherspoon is of course marvelous but so too is her chemistry with jason london the score is remarkable breezy and pure james newton howard enhances the quality of any film he composes for tenfold he also seems to have a knack for lost-days-of-youth movies be sure to catch his score for the recent peter pan and the haunting gothic music of the village i first saw this film at about or and now i don't just cry at the ending i shed a tear or two for the nostalgia show this movie to your daughters it will end up becoming a lifetime comfort film
if you played spider-man on the ps version then you've seen it all to truly experience it you should get the dc version simply put a much graphically superior game the textures are sharp levels are easy to navigate and it has much better sound then ps cousin i bought this game back in late and it still holds up even till this day well marvel ultimate alliance is a much superior and strategic game but if you're a fan of ol web head then you owe it yourself to pick this up for your gaming library swinging around the city as spidey has never looked this good and dead-on in a video game if you have a dreamcast snag this up for cheap the dc version is simply incredible
a sequel to angels with dirty faces in name only the angels wash their faces suffers somewhat from the usual shenanigans of the dead end kids as a matter of fact with the presence of the dead end kids and ann sheridan this should have been treated as an actual sequel to angels with dirty faces at least for of ann sheridan she is the one true shining light of this movie to paraphrase a cliché ann sheridan could read from a phone book for two hours and i would buy the virtue of this movie is the chemistry between ann sheridan and ronald reagan unfortunately this aspect of the film is kept too far in the background for a better example of the sheridan-reagan duo i would recommend juke girl or kings row
i was bored one night and red eye was on and thought why eye is one of the best movies in a long mean i just got into the movie cause it was just so story is new and movie also has two great leads in the movie with rachel mcadams as lisa reisert and cillian murphy as jackson acting is just brilliant and you get the feel for the people in the music is just excellent it give you chills and can also make you feel just love how the movie was just so well done and it never gets eye is just phenomenal nothing more and nothing a excellent i enjoy red eye so much that i can watch it over and over you like red eye then i recommend elektra and cry give red eye out of movie
carmen is one of the best films i've ever seen hard to say whose performance is best antonio gades cristina hoyos and laura del sol are dance their souls out a beautiful tale of inseparability of life and myth myth penetrates everyday life dance becomes life and entire life is danced out real people at one and the same time live their own lives and become somebody else act out the parts of lovers of old the magic is continuing
this film moved me beyond comprehension it is and will remain my favourite film of all time mainly because it has almost every emotion all rolled into its minutes what is the hardest part for me to take is that whenever i want to hear the amazing music and songs from the film i have to put it into my dvd player so i was wondering if anyone anywhere knows who sings the songs in the film and where they can be found as i have looked everywhere i can think sporadically over the past years my favourite quote from the film is when in court the advocate says but your own words ask for direct confrontation isn't that a direct call for violence biko replies well you and i are in confrontation now but i see no robertson fife scotland
kurt russell whose career started when he kicked the real elvis in it happened at the fair will probably never top his performance as the king in this biopic helmed by slash and shock meister carpenter there are times you feel that you're watching elvis until something snaps you back to memories of a hapless don johnson in elvis and the beauty queen all the performances here are excellent season hubley as priscilla pat hingle as the colonel even shelley winters brings the right level of nerves and hysteria to her rendering of momma dad bing is here playing elvis father vernon and a fine understated performance from robert gray as elvis buddy and bodyguard red west must see for rock n roll fans
i thought this movie was fantastic it was hilarious kinda reminded me of spinal tap this is a must see for any fan of rock hope me and my friends aren't like that in twenty nighy gives an excellent performance as the off kilter lead singer trying to recapture that old rea fits perfectly into the movie as the glue trying to hold the band together but not succeeding you love music and were ever in a band this movie is definitely for you you won't regret seeing this movie i know i don't even my family found it funny and saying something
the directing behind this film was fantastic for a comedy many of the scenes appear to be out of a comic book and much darker not story wise than what i expected granted this may not be the funniest movie ever made especially if you are into very crude sexist jokes as this has very little of that to others like something about mary or american pie as you rewatch it several jokes stand out and get funnier if you have ever read a comic book or watched a comic book-type movie x-men etc and liked them you will probably enjoy the subtle humor that continues throughout the movie if you didn't like them you may like the respectful ridicule that this film has for those if you did like this movie the dvd has some cool extras
had placed this on my tivo for a rainy day due to the cast some really hard working people in the industry and when i finally watched i was not movie has some altman-like flavor mentioned in the end credits as a thanks person utilizing seemingly independent unrelated plot lines that intertwine as the film draws to its climax macy is pure clean and honest as a man who can't seem to escape his destiny sutherland plays and portrays as few can neve adds splash to a deliberately toned down environment add tracy ullman barbara bain mission impossible on tv not to mention the steady john ritter and you have all the ingredients for a good film the script is uncluttered the dialog is free from cliché and thoughtful between macy and david dorfman suspend belief and enjoy this is truly time well spent
a colorful slasher movie about has the mystery element that scream made so popular in slasher movies but i never care for such things figuring out the bad guy is not that interesting considering the clues are all misleading death scenes were inventive and gorey bringing back memories of horror movies like friday the nice thing about this movie is that hard to pinpoint the surviving girl unlike in scream and ikwydls where it was obvious who don't like slasher movies won't like this movie as simple as that i truly enjoyed it and i plan to watch it again while waiting for more of the same
when tsui hark experiments nothing and no one can withstand him legend of zu is possibly condensed into one does not understand all but like at a space odyssey you also don't have to but one feels the power of the film to every second every picture an extraordinary vision of the future of the art and the one of the most pioneering astounding rejoicing in the recent years vital severe masterpiece absolutely perfect as it tsui hark experiments nothing and no one can withstand him legend of zu is possibly condensed into one does not understand all but one feels the power of the film to every second every picture an extraordinary vision of the future of the art and the one of the most pioneering astounding rejoicing in the recent years vital severe masterpiece absolutely perfect as it is
when i first saw this movie the first thing i thought was this movie was more like an anime than a movie the reason is because it involves vampires doing incredible stunts the stunts are very much like the matrix moves like the moving too fast for bullets kinda thing and the jumping around very far another reason why i the movie is good is because the adorable anime faces they do during the movie the way gackt does his pouting faces or just the way they act very anime i think that a really good movie to watch the action in this movie is a to mention gackt and hyde too are a if you are gackt and hyde fans you have to see it
does anyone else cry tears of joy when they watch this film i love it one of my top films of all time it just makes me feel good i watch the closing production number with all the cast members over and over and over bebe benson johnston is the babe of the film imho i never saw the play but i get angry when i read reviews that say the play was better than the film the two are like apples and oranges the film making process will seldom deliver a finished product that is faithful to the original work i believe only due to the fear of public alienation that many well known works adapted to the screen aren't changed more than they are this is a very good film it is very satisfying all you need to know
this is a great film classic from the and well produced there are very dramatic scenes in this film with john of and dane fighting the japs during wwii being completely surrounded and with only one machine-gun when al schmid was able to go home after being wounded with a horrible injury his problems just started to begin with his family and engaged girl friend dane clark gave an outstanding supporting role as lee diamond who did everything to help his buddy al get his life together again there is never a complete victory to war and lets not forget all the brave wounded military personnel in veterans hospitals from all the wars and our present iraq vets
the japanese run lola run his is one offbeat movie which will put a smile on just about face fans of run lola run tampopo go and slacker will probably like this one it does tend to follow a formula that is increasingly popular these days of separate seemingly unrelated vignettes all contributing the the overall story in unexpected ways catch it if you see it otherwise wait for the rental
i acquired this one of my all-time favourite films on dvd recently and as usual during viewing the whole thing just blew me am a massive fan of hazel o'connor and the soundtrack to this film just has me in tears especially the will you track a pure nostalgia trip for me back to my youth this rates second best to quadrophenia also starred phil great soundtrack and a great view of britain in the thatcherite years of the grim in which i grew up the ending is so sad for hours after the end of the film i am like a blubbering expect to wear out this dvd from repeated viewing i can watch it over and over again and never be bored simply for the soundtrack sorry to hear about your dad darling god bless you all xx
i personally watched this to see the footage of the and it was fascinating to learn how the drug movement essentially started and became pop culture and an eventual uncompromising force in life the interviews of the classic rock stars are titillating and humorous you feel like you're in on a secret and nodding your head at the same it feels so good and familiar i loved it all segments from day i highly recommend this for all aspects including rock music the hipper movement politics and good ol history i check marked the box saying this contains a spoiler only because i have no idea what some might consider a spoiler or not in this regards since i discussed in all segments so just wanted to be safe
i have watched this movie well over times and i love it each and every time i watched it yes it can be very corny but it is also very funny and enjoyable the camp shown in the movie is a real camp that i actually attended for years and is portrayed as camp really is a great place to spend the summer everyone who has ever gone to camp wanted to go to camp or has sent a child to camp should see this movie because it'll bring back wonderful memories for you and for your kids
i went to this movie only because i was dragged there and i would have left again immediately because the audience consisted mainly of elderly people and i felt out of place however the film was utterly fascinating and far from being targeted towards old people the characters were all very real and believable and i found myself discussing the film the characters and the storyline for hours afterwards there are a few quite engrossing scenes in there but they are necessary and help you to understand the situation much better all in all this is a great and valuable film slightly off mainstream but that does not mean that this film cannot be enjoyed by people who prefer mainstream a thrilling and interesting movie experience
the second care bears movie is immensely better than its predecessor it has a deeper plot better character development and the tunes the closing song are both catchy and warm-hearted sure the movie tends to over stress caring but come on it is a care bears movie this movie is a great picture to show to kids because it emphasizes friendship love and again caring not to mention the care bears are just too adorable
has anyone noticed that james earl jones is the waiter who is serving when wife reveals that she is pregnant while they are at the restaurant next to the lake i watched this movie on a video that i had taped off of the television when i watched this scene i thought i recognized the voice of jones when the waiter laughed at the end i rewound the tape then slowly stepped through that part as the camera pulled back and showed the waiter listen closely as the waiter laughs when hagarty looks up and tells him that they are going to have a baby then watch closely or slow down the scene when the camera shows the waiter albeit quickly
while rome goes mad celebrating visit uniforms bands parades two outsiders stay home in a large building and wind up meeting she is sofia loren who is the wife of brutish public servant and mother of six children he is mastroianni a radio speaker been fired because of his homosexuality both of them need company and understanding both f them find it in each movie covers a span of a few hours the color are faded and everything takes place with a sound track of military marches and hysterical radio announcers strangely enough the nazi anthem the horst-wessel-lied ends up becoming a romantic musical movie excellent recreation of a special era in italian history and a touching sad story mastroianni is as good as we have come to expect and sofia loren does a superb job very far away from her usual truck pin-up neapolitan fishwife personas don't miss it
i recorded this ages ago but only got round to watching it today i have been ill so had run out of stuff to watch i am so glad i saw it and which i could erase my memory and watch i again for the first time this movie is so wonderful it reminded me very much of fried green tomatoes at the whistlestop cafe story goes back in time and at the end of the movie we see what the connections are some people have said this is a kids movie i disagree it may be made by disney and many characters are children but i am and i loved it there were moments when my spine tingled the story is unlike any other film these days full of adventure i have just ordered the book from amazon can't wait
this would have been my number one movie of the year for except it got beat out by the brilliant jfk this is such a wonderful movie i loved it i love stories where different characters lives intersect with others and how deal with their lives kevin kline is good here but is outshined by danny glover and especially steve martin i've never much like martin or his style but here he is great i loved the whole speech he gave to kline near the end about the grand canyon the writing was excellent larry kasdan is imo a great dialogue writer along the ways of kevin smith and quentin tarantino here he has formed several three-dimensional characters and well thought out storylines and messages that give a positive feel to our lives a truly excellent film out of stars
dear god where do i begin this is bar none the best movie i've ever seen the camera angles are great but in my opinion the acting was the best why the script writers for this movie aren't writing big budget films i will never understand another is the cast it is great this is the best ted raimi film out there for sure i know some of you out there are probably thinking no way he has plenty better but no your wrong raptor island is a work of art i hope it should have goten best movie of the year instead of that crappy movie crash with a bunch of no names and no raptors i believe this movie is truly the most wonderful thing ever
the quintessential road your idea of a road movie involves three would-be magicians with eastern european accents and claire forlani one out of four ain't bad a no-talent magician with an eye for showmanship watches a very skilled pickpocket plying his trade in new york after convincing hugo that he is a mental and b desperately in need of a partner to make his dreams of being a stage magician come alive the not-so-dynamic duo enlist the managerial expertise of an inventor of illusions and the ah gentler attributes of a lovely waitress the unlikely four pile into a van by guess where it came from and head to vegas havoc ensues anyhow funny well-written and the ending is surprisingly good a solid comedy with a warm heart and all the better that it was totally unexpected
a young man named court is loved by everyone his painful bloody death brings everyone closer you can find other symbols and allusions throughout the movie whether predictable or not and irrespective of ecclesiastical beliefs this is a moving story full of milieu and other thing someone mentioned that his fate was so quick that it didn't seem plausible but the elements for this are set up subtly note what his mom says about bringing his lunch out to the field note how he is holding the steering wheel and his gloves he is sweaty and operating dangerous equipment to this day tractors are pretty dangerous
i saw this film a few years ago and i got to say that i really love patric was perfect for this weird role that he don't too many things about i don't screenplay is for just a few words i have to say about this movie that is a good saw it a few years ago and never saw it since want to see it again and know that i'm not gonna get sick of watching is movie should have lasted think minutes should have been was hoping for a part for this bad it din't the man very good movie the end
you like rap or hip-hop watch this movie although funny if you don't get the references as a straight seen much of the much hyped but what i did see didn't have the heart that this little stormer heard from the people involved since which is a surprise the film is very similar to spinal tap which is no bad thing and i think a lot of the dialogue while priceless in tap is funnier here probably because i'm more into rap than rock theses days so my own judgment does cloud that rap songs are funny as hell and basically spot the reference for most of the film not all of them are in-your-face which means the physical comedy and the one-liners get priority over the fun one to watch twice if there ever was a movie
i have just finished watching this film and i can honestly say that this is a work of art i was very surprised to see the overall rating as only does guy bring together a b movie cast and make them into such glorious characters he has given us a movie with a fantastically diverse story line with much left to the too many people are wanting movies with a plot that can be understood and handed to them on a these are the films that get poor reviews because they are far too film is special get it now
fair story movie that focuses on the lives of blue collar people finding new life thru new acting here is good but the film fails in and is only average at film will be enjoyed by fonda and de niro fans and by people who love middle age love stories where in the coartship is on a more wiser and cautious would also be interesting for people who are interested on the subject matter regarding illiteracy
i just saw this film in santa barbara my friend knew someone who worked on it so i thought i'd check it out i thought it was a really beautiful film and cant wait to go look at it again the actors were really good and i loved all the music there was not a lot of talking in the film which at first felt a little but once i got into it i thought that the story and the acting was really emotional and meaningful and thought that it left a lot to the imagination i want to see the movie again because there was so much going on in it that i forgot a lot of small things but know that i left the theater thinking about the film it was shot beautifully and the whole thing was really unique
my bush is a live action project made by south park creators trey parker and matt show was cancelled after one season not because of bad actually got good reviews but because it was very my bush is a pretty funny spoof of an average network tv is also a political this is nowhere near as good as south park but it is a very funny spoof of a sitcom and also a pretty good political guy who plays in my bush looks a lot like him if you can find the show check it are plenty of laughs to be
this silly movie is really fun for the younger audiences its heros are a couple of dud detectives whose sophomoric attitudes lead them down some very silly roads chasing the big murder case you will see these detectives go to every length to solve the crime no nudity but lots of sexual implication slapstick adolescents go for low budget but very entertaining definite cult classic potential
as i was watching this film on video last night i kept getting these tingles that told me this one will endure i've a feeling i'll be watching this again and again for years to got all the timeless qualities you could ask for in a and even though some cultural references are obscure for me a western viewer at the core this is a universal tale
in the history of movies based on comic books mystery men is one of the most underrated ones this is no regular comic superhero movie it follows the exploits of a motley crew of well-meaning wannabes which include mr furious by ben stiller the bowler garofalo the shoveller h macy the blue rajah azariah and the spleen reubens mystery men spoofs several aspects of superhero movies like superman or batman such as the pithy sayings and the questions about secret identities most of the superheroes aren't billionaires like bruce wayne but blue-collar types with menial jobs and neurotic home lives so it looks as if director kinka usher is making the heroes into something the average viewer can relate to i found mystery men to be visually stimulating and very funny even if it doesn't turn into a franchise still a joy to watch
a cooking competition show americanized not going to be the japanese show is great i could care less about cooking but this show is just entertaining to watch from the intensity put into the dishes by the chef to the goofy chairman truly a good way to spend some time watching tv could critique the show for having guests like marc ecko as a judge but meh entertaining enough to watch and generally the winner deserves the prize yeah and i'm bitter john besh isn't the new iron chef cuisine
this is a classic with so many great dialogs and scenes nobody should miss nice story funny riches-to-rags situations mel brooks is not a bad lead maybe not perfect but he is funny d don't pay attention to the rating bs watch it then watch something like final destination and tell me that life stinks deserves about the same rating if you do i don't think we can be friends xd at this point i recommend the fourth season of curb your enthusiasm to every brooks fan vote against the ignorant opinions of inchworms i've to make lines here to post a comment i don't wanna write a book here p
i chose to watch this film at tribeca based on judd hirsch and scott cohen and found it to be one of the best movies in the festival both leading actors deliver a well rounded sensitive performance that seems to match the characters on a personal level the director did a great job bringing the characters and story to life with skill that is usually not seen in a first-time interesting aspect of this film is the love of woodwork and new york city in specific the movie revolves around the family furniture making business and weaves delicate cinematography of both carpentry and ordinary brooklyn life again kudos to the director on this fine is gem and i would whole heartedly recommend it sure it will make it to the screen
it just funny watch it they want lines so there this is a spoof of werewolf movies lots of satire some political feels like an early clouseau movie due to alan arkin but with less slap stick if you like the naked guns movies you'll like this too again less slapstick in this one the humor ranges from light sexual innuendo in a teen comedy to really poignant socio-political satire the transformation of the moon high school from to is really funny the sequence with the changing presidential portraits is brilliant ok maybe not brilliant but still hilarious there are tons of cracks starting from the cold war paranoia and the late just watch the movie if you get a chance
presque rien is a beautifully observed portrait of the experiences of a young french homosexual eschewing both stereotypes and preaching a wonderfully naturalistic film superbly acted shot with a feel for the seaside town where the action takes place never melodramatic but often painfully real if anything almost too realistic as little in the way of conventional plot just scenes from a life but the absence of conventional dramatic tension counts for less than it might in a world so subtly drawn presque rien might not be the most exciting film ever made but its simple humanism serves it well compared with the pre-conceived celebratory or bigoted viewpoints that often mar treatments of this theme worth a watch
i enjoyed watching this well acted movie very was well by actress helen hunt and actors steven weber and jeff was a very interesting with drama and the beginning to the very reccomend that everyone take the time to watch this made for television is excellent and has great acting
gerard phillipe is absolutely perfect in this movie funny tender brave and gives a superior dimension to a movie which is even a masterpiece as much by the other actors as by the story or the rhythm never boring always creating new emotions for me the best french movie of all time
what can i say ms erika eleniak is my favorite blonde girl ever and like a italian american fan number one of female beauty i can't forget this know i really don't remember a lot about the plot or the situations or the other actors i only can remember about drop dead gorgeous erika and that in this film she looks better than ever i really don't care if it was a bad movie or a good movie i only care the nice moments i had been a teenager in brooklyn just contemplating just to conclude if you are an erika beauty fan like me definitely this film is for you
still love it or so years after the first time i saw it in fact i discovered that i had lost my copy of this and was very upset despite non-association with the original as a kid i never noticed and as an adult i don't care about this is what cartoons be like just dark enough to be interesting and light enough to be enjoyed by everyone i'm more than glad that my parents raised me on this kind of thing rather than the cartoons we see today that teach our kids nothing the music is great and gets stuck in your head have downloaded the entire soundtrack at one point or another
giallo fans seek out this rare film it is well written and full of all sorts of the usual low lifes that populate these films i don't want to give anything away so i wont even say anything about the plot the whole movie creates a very bizarre atmosphere and you don't know what to expect or who to suspect recommended the only place i've seen to get this film in english is from european trash cinema for
panic is a sneaky little gem of a film you think you have it figured out by the first half hour only to realize with great pleasure that henry bromell is a much better than that film builds slowly with one quietly devastating scene after another all enacted perfectly by william h macy donald sutherland neve campbell tracey ullman john ritter and the most remarkable child actor i've seen in a long time david dorfman as son who delivers his lines as if they're completely unscripted thoughts being created in his mind rich and rewarding this film will stay with you long after the credits have rolled
this is a very grim hard hitting even brutal film about a death row break that goes awry black and white photography keeps it from being dated mickey rooney is excellent as the twisted yet strangely sympathetic lead one of the first movies to portray the psychological desolation of death row it is also quite poignant
pinjar is one of the few movies that really leaves a mark and makes you think hard set in partition india this film shows the true reality of partition india urmila gets full marks for her beautiful and deeply emotional portrayal of a suffering woman with no way to go her freedom personal identity and family respect taken away overnight over a tragic land dispute manoj bajpai is simply brilliant as her remorseful abductor there several moments in the film where one is brought to tears the film at points is deeply traumatic some of the partition scenes are spine chilling yet endurance and survival are both remarkable from a woman robbed of her freedom to woman who gave freedom to women in similar situations a remarkable film that should be given credit for intelligent characters and storytelling
most of the comments have been positive but i would like to add that viewers should also focus on the sets the set designer used a lot of beautiful art deco treatments along with beautiful buildings stairs doors furniture and so forth it is worth paying attention to the movie is driven by characterization and symbolism which is very rich all the gangster actors were cast it was like seeing old friends and it was a treat the dialog was amusing at times but stilted at times and i suppose it was meant to be that way this is a film film it was made by people for people who love the medium don't miss this one
i was surprised at how fascinating this movie was the performances were extremely good especially by rea as the compassionate no-nonsense a low budget no big fx or flashy camerawork citizen x somehow manages to surpass the majority of similar big hollywood films by just telling the stories tend to end with a whimper rather than a bang and the case here but apart from that this is a highly recommended detective yarn
this was soul-provoking i am an iranian and living in th century i didn't know that such big tribes have been living in such conditions at the time of my see that today or even in on one side of the world a lady or a baby could have everything served for him or her clean and on-demand but here years ago people ventured their life to go to somewhere with more grass really interesting that these persians bear those difficulties to find pasture for their sheep but they lose many the sheep on their praise the americans who accompanied this tribe they were as tough as bakhtiari people
indian cinema typifies cops of two broad categories they are either the honest type or the bad guys the honest guys always shout at the top of their voice and fight the system while the bad cops enjoy for most part but suffer at the movie at least breaks this usual formula and gives a refreshing view of cops and their lives the direction takes an inside look at the life of a young ambitious cop who the music is interesting and the editing is a trend setter as far as indian cinema movie is slow at times and the dilemma which anbu faces when it comes to maya is overplayed at times but i would still give this one simply because it has many firsts to its credit
this will be a different kind of review i've seen this movie twice on tv and would like to have a copy because it talks about panama city and the beach in the winter time which is my favorite time to be there it was the first movie i'd seen by ashley judd and she was great and i've enjoyed every other thing i've seen her in reaction made an impression on me too as did the director victor nunez who has directed and written several movies about florida this movie speaks to me and i've seen nothing with which to compare it the plot speaks less to me than the surroundings well i told you it would be a different kind of review
i cherish each and every frame of this beautiful movie it is about regular people people we all know who suffer a little in their life and have some baggage to carry around just like all of us robert deniro ed harris and kathy baker breathe life into their portrayals and are all excellent but harris is especially heartbreaking and therefore very real you would swear he really is a trucker who drinks so he won't have to feel anything baker as his put-upon sister also has some delicate moments when deniro gives her flowers in one scene it seems like she was never given flowers before and probably wasn't very worthwhile
this is my favorite classic it was filmed a little west of philadelphia pa when i was in and released the next year then in i found myself working the very same county as a rookie pa state trooper i have always enjoyed checking out the different places where scenes were filmed i knew the owner of the downingtown diner well and he had a road sign out front which told all passing motorists that this was the home of the blob the theater scene was in phoenixville near valley forge park and it is still showing films today
personally i think that the film was done very professionally i loved the choreography and the acting the plot is also gripping and mysterious the film itself is very emotional and what i liked about it most is that it makes you think afterwards antonio gades has absolutely lived his role to the end and i must say that one of my favourite pictures and saura is a wonderful director
the group of people are travelling to belgrade in an awful bus led by a drunk conductor and his dumb son likes to drive with his eyes closed their journey is frequently interrupted by many hilarious events which with much irony describe the fall of spirit in and are so funny that they are even today used as a common jokes the man who steals the show is a peasant feet tall with his sons who are almost two times bigger than him in the end the movie takes one dramatical turn and the trip becomes nothing but a song of a dying country
or at least one of the best i think this is a very fun and very cool game for the bowser is up to his usual shenanigans a dumb word but the only one i can think of and mario must stop him again this game is very fun to play and contains lots of nostalgia to me the only bad thing about it is the graphics which are awful to standards but everything else is pretty good the little mini-games you can unlock the second best game first best is bad fur day that i recommend to any mario fan or any fan of platform games it beats out mediocre super mario sunshine any or a
i saw the description of the movie on tcm and only let it run because i like both peter ustinov and maggie smith so i was delightfully surprised to find that i really liked the movie and found it quite exceptional of course it is seriously dated but as a period piece it is well worth watching just for the subtle humour in insight into life and lifestyle almost forty years ago now the only problem is trying to find it on dvd so i can watch it more often i also was quite taken with the performances of smith and ustinov as the leads and of karl malden bob newhart and the cameo appearances by robert morley and cesar romero
the dinner party could quite possibly be in my opinion the greatest adult cinema production of all time it is produced in such an exquisite manner and the actors portray their roles excellently the kitchen scene starring yvonne and juli ashton is magnificent the use of the butter and milk really makes the scene additionally the office scene is well done the campfire scene is filled with enjoyable action though the choice of actors in this scene is questionable asia performance in the junkyard scene is incredible but who would expect anything less from her the closing scene is somewhat over used in adult films but is classic none the less i would highly recommend this film to all fans of adult films and those casual viewers run out to your video store and pick it up today
i saw it last night on tv and was quite delighted is sort of the movie which makes you feel nice and warm around heart and believe that there is still some goodness in the world the neighbours pretended not to see what grace was doing in order to help her and protect the old policeman is my favourite although you know that this story is not quite loved acting all seemed just as ordinary common people living in small picturesque english coast town but the greatest thing in the movie was the wit and humor it has just remember the scene in the shop with two old ladies after they had their the ending was a little bit confusing but it didn't stop me from really really enjoying the whole story
something about paulie touched my heart as few movies do it is a witty funny yet emotional movie i'm a late comer in becoming a fan of this movie i didn't see paulie until may and have since ordered the widescreen dvd from a seller at special effects of showing paulie talking are superb my son asked me how the bird knew so many my favorite part of the movie is when paulie is in gena rowlands company followed by cheech marin tony shalhoub plays an excellent part as the good hearted human you root for him all the way through the can't go wrong renting or buying this movie
although i have not seen this mini-series in over twenty years i can still remember how the balance between and tale of marvelous adventures succeeded the use of special effects was restrained making a more poetic rather than literal telling of the story the two versions i've seen were dubbed and the actors appear to speak their own language not just italian so there is a synchronization problem it does not spoil the story telling among the cast irene pappas as penelope is the most recognizable to north americans recommended to all followers of odysseus ever returning
my family has watched arthur bach stumble and stammer since the movie first came out we have most lines memorized i watched it two weeks ago and still get tickled at the simple humor and view-at-life that dudley moore portrays liza minelli did a wonderful job as the side kick though i'm not her biggest fan this movie makes me just enjoy watching movies my favorite scene is when arthur is visiting his house his conversation with the butler and father is side-spitting the line from the butler would you care to wait in the library followed by reply yes i would the bathroom is out of the question is my newmail notification on my computer arthur is truly funny stuff
i think the opening minutes of this film is perhaps one of the most exciting filmed with the brilliant music score working to build tension to a shattering climax what cinema goers made of this in the i can only imagine the times said at the time a miracle has come to the screen watch it and marvel
i was in the film too but i don't know if they actually put this scene in on the way back from a school trip we stopped at a service station at the same time as they were doing the film and we were asked whole of us to run in and shout go freebird we were all around years old could anyone who has seen the film tell me if that part was actually kept in the film it would be great to know i remember i thought the film had never come out because it was another and a half years before it was released all of your comments seem to be good so i'm guessing it has been quite a successful film i might buy it but first i would like to know if i'm in it d thank you
why didn't this pick up a bag full of oscars it is an amazing interpretaion of an piece the visuals are breathtaking in pan scan really kills this wonderful cinematography and sets every frame is a painting astounding the play is almost completely intact and passion for it is clear from the opening titles on no zefferelli here just great storytelling the way only film can but rarely does jacobi is especially perfect as murderous uncle he doesn't play him as a curling evil villian but a charming politician allowing us to see why only hamlet suspects foul play branagh also nails the subtlety of the line between madness and the burning revenge inside him and the many cameos come off quite well everyone from billy crystal and robin williams to gerard depardeu and charlton heston unobtrusive if you are sucked into vision the way i was a mesmerizing piece
what a delightful movie the characters were not only lively but alive mirroring real every day life and strife within a family each character brought a unique personality to the story that the audience could easily associate with someone they know within their own family or circle of close story has a true-to-life flow that the viewer can assimilate into and be part of the drama the laughter and tears as the plot of the movie develops the script does a good job of capturing the common emotions actions and reactions of the characters to conflict opinion and an epic but it is a very nice movie to watch with loved ones plenty of knowing head nods and ahhh moments to share and enjoy
shot actors portray exactly their role you get a real feeling watching lucienne ascend from poverty to the most beautiful girl around a sense of tragedy to triumph to tragedy again all in all i have seen this film at least times and can very well say that prix de beute beauty prize miss europe is a major favorite in my silent film collection the expressiveness of louise brooks is perfect and i recommend this film to anyone who appreciates artistic beauty coupled with a tragic story line
i dug out from my garage some old musicals and this is another one of my favorites it was written by jay alan lerner and directed by vincent minelli it won two academy awards for best picture of and best screenplay the story of an american painter in paris who tries to make it big nina foch is a sophisticated lady of means and is very interested in helping him but soon finds she loves the guy meanwhile gene kelly falls for lovely damsel leslie caron his main dancing partner and i must say they are fantastic together on the floor and otherwise famous french singer georges guietary sings too so if you like good smooth dancing and fun filled scenes filled with oscar nimble piano fingers the songs of george gershwyn will live on forever in this colorful gem
i rented this movie on dvd without knowing what to expect and as i am about to study film-making in canada of all places i most certainly will bring this up in story centered around the probably most unlucky film team in the history of film itself is brilliantly written and the very talented actors manage to deliver every single pun on you simply couldn't laugh during hollywood north i suggest seeing a psychiatrist right away you might have serious the wonderful script i also noticed the great chemistry between actors deborah kara unger and matthew modine where they really just acting jennifer tilly a hilariously bad actress and martin landau also delivered a very edgy yet funny film even better cast
i have been a fan of pushing daisies since the very beginning it is wonderfully thought up and bryan fuller has the most remarkable ideas for this is unbelievable on how much tv has been needing a creative original show like pushing daisies it is a huge relief to see a show that is unlike the rest where as if you compared it to some of the newer shows such as scrubs and house you would see the similarities and it does get tedious at moments to see shows so close in a magnificent cast wonderful script and hilarity in every episode pushing daisies is by-far one of the most remarkable shows on your television
yeah a bit of a silly film so if you are looking for an oscar performance forget this if you love john humor this is a must-see we lost john candy before he made enough of his great brand of comedy and he is only better in one movie planes trains automobiles steve martin excellent supporting performance by eugene levy perhaps his best work ever as the hot-headed sal dipasquale also good acting by richard libertini alley mills pat hingle you must see this obscure and out-of-print film if you are a john candy or eugene levy fan
gunga din is based on rudyard movie is directed by george set in india during the century where three british soldiers have to stop an evil guru and his murderous din is a marvelous adventure war comedy with plenty of thrilling three leading men are grant is cutter victor mclaglen is macchesney and douglas fairbanks son of the legendary you know who is not forget the other fine players who include sam jaffe playing gunga din himself in a brilliant beautiful and gifted joan fontaine is emaline awfully fun to watch the difficulties of and wedding din is awfully lot of can be funny it can be can be everything a good movie requires
definitely one of my favourite movies the story is good acting is great all technicals cinematography are sharp and the script is ledger is terrific as edward ned kelly he is gripping as the legendary outlaw and is supported well by geoffrey rush naomi watts and orlando bloom all action sequences are on film is edge-of-your seat stuff right up to to the end one of my favourite films from the late legend heath ledger who has been the highlight of every film he has starred in and makes no mistake excellent film all round
when will people learn that some movies are made for fun and are not necessarily out to change the world if you realise this then expect to have heaps of fun while watching bill and bogus journey this is a movie that is heaps of fun to watch keanu and alex make a great on screen team reprising their characters from bill and excellent adventure with even more style then they had in movie not rocket science but great for a laugh the characters being extremely like-able and the story-line being so radical you have to laugh don't expect deep-and-meaningfulls just expect pure fun
i'm disappointed at the lack of posts on this surprising and effective little film jordi mollà probably best known for his role as diego in ted blow writes directs and won't give away any plot points as the movie least for me was very exciting having not known anything about it if you have a netflix account or have access to a video store that would carry highly recommend it a crazy fun and sometimes very thought provoking direction is impressive and shows a lot of with amazing imagery and a great lead performance spoken in beautiful spanish no somos nadie is on air is an amazing film you can show off to your it
the events of september do not need extra human interest in the shape of following the training of the rookie fireman or the progress of the two french brothers in my view it would have been better to leave this out i think the directors tried too hard perhaps they felt that the events of the day needed a story as a backdrop the comment of one of a policemen this aint disneyworld is it is compelling viewing for the depiction of the events the filmakers were in all the right places at the right times no other footage from the day matches what they shot
it is written in stone that disney animations simply be musicals right where show me because i found this attempt to be much more enjoyable for containing the hokey made-for-five-year-old standard disney musical fare the story was not as enthralling as it could have been it was still quite good enjoyable and adventurous i had hoped for a bit more yes considering the subject matter but this movie is the bitter disappointment or utter failure it has been billed to be animation quality is average but the dialog is quite compelling as is the story line plot sub-plot and amazing creativity i found within this production i will refrain from outlining the plot as it has been done and done but this movie is well worth a view if you are a fan of is in my opinion the best disney animated feature length rates a fiend
mina kumari exhibits more style and grace just moving from standing to sitting on the floor than you can find in most other movies the director has produced more memorable scenes of touching beauty than it would seem possible the music and dancing is of the highest possible quality you may notice in the first dance scene the director has all sorts of things occurring in the girl dancing a drunk falling down stairs much activity but he knew that we would be watching mina dance and i'll bet unless you viewed this many times you didn't in all
as with all the other reviewers this movie has been a constant in my mind after years i recall going to the library researching all that i could on this story i even wrote to the pbs station for more information despite all this all i was able to find out was that it was a story printed in a newspaper in the early part of the to after years of searching ebay for on a weekly basis and there it was a vhs copy of the movie there was one other bidder but i was determined to win this movie the losing bidder wrote me asking for a copy which i gave her despite owning a copy i still searched and searched finally finding a site that sold a dvd copy of the movie you can find it at
i started to watch this movie expecting nothing just another movie to watch but since the first twenty minutes the artwork and main character who is enigmatic doesn't talk much really got me in this really liked this movie it was dark beautifully acted and really touching a bit slow but the immersion was complete the directing was awesome by letting us know bits by bits the story leading to the conviction of joey and his life behind bars the music was really great and very well incorporated into the scenes the ending was unexpected with a twist i didn't see coming not the kind of movie we see often
i've been a jennifer connelly fan since phenomena and after i heard about seven minutes in heaven i saw it as soon as i could the movie is not only a comedy if you think a lot of these things most of us went through as kids and are currently going through not only was the movie terrific led by the phenomenal jennifer connelly it captivated my attention that this movie was terrifically written directed and acted out it was one good deal i loved it and have watched it again and again and for those of you who enjoy a good laugh or love jennifer connelly you to can not put off seeing this movie
by god been a long time since i saw this probably about years movie tells us all about human blood and the circulatory system very professionally put animation plus human was directed by frank capra for of an overkill i wonder if the very high production value is worth what amounts to a worth of information on the human body but boy will those kids watching it learn even now i can clearly remember dr baxter being challenged by hemo himself to name what common material most resembles human blood to which the doctor immediately answers sea water
most hollywood movies fail to capture the full range of experience of teenagers this film demonstrates exactly how to do it right it combines elements of humour suffering rebellion etc in a way that is comlex sympathetic the ending could be a bit clearer but the fact that the director doesn't spell everything out for you in advance before coming to the conclusion means that this film assumes a more intelligent viewer
anyone who lived through the ages of revenge of the nerds and girlpower will appreciate this film it is one of those films that delivers everything you want in a spring break movie plus it makes fun of the college film genre funny got a cast to die for pohler rachel dratch sophie monk parker posey jane lynch amber tamblyn missi pyle and its guaranteed to make you laugh out loud actor rachel dratch is a comic genius and sophie monk is such a great villain wilson phillips omg just repeating myself now it will live on with girls who like miranda july but feel like eating ice cream and pretending they're dumb
this movie is worth seeing for the visual beauty and moving acting alone but there also is an interesting cultural subtext of alienation women and performers brought together in a supporting role of a transvestite opera star are both doomed to be relegated to subserviant roles in china this makes the unlikely bonding between an aged street performer and a young girl even stronger as a triumph over the native only problem i had with this movie was the tendency of the soundtrack to swell up with emotion rendered unnecessary by the actors welcome alternative to unsatisfying summer action movies
convoluted infuriating and implausible fay grim is hard to sit through but parker posey is really the only actress who could take this story and run with it at once cunning the supporting actors commit to it as wont even try to tell you the plot it involves characters from henry fool and attempts a tale of international film works well if you continue along with it-understanding it is in a sense completely ridiculous it becomes more and more ridiculous as you plod along resisted the temptation to turn off the dvd grim requires an adventurous film-goer willing to tackle something that isn't cookie-cutter in the end it offers something that defies description
when i found this film in my local videostore i expected it to be another cheesy american vampire film in the same vein of the lost my surprise to die for is a really good a little bit corny at still there are enough stylish set-pieces and surprises to satisfy vampire is a perfect mix of romance and horror and surprisingly gory at recommended
every movie critic and metal head hated this movie but i enjoyed it i saw this as a child on tv somewhere and was amazed by the scene where sammi comes on stage and plays trick or treat by movie itself was typical guy gets pushed around by bullies and enlists supernatural help to beat up the bullies but goes to far and has to be from melrose place picks on skippy from family ties so skippy gets a record of tony fields from gene simmons to comfort him and all hell breaks lose the highlight being where tony sings and dances to a metal song before the shyt hits the were a lot of errors and stuff but the music and the overall imagery was enough to keep my fists pumping out of
screwball comedy about romantic mismatches in new york city peter bogdanovich is obviously in love with all the women in his reveres audrey hepburn is put a notch above the others because after all the princess bogdanovich probably fell in love with at the movies years prior he shoots her in loving close-ups gets right in the sheets between her and a wonderfully ben gazzara and allows her room to sparkle throughout the love-connections made in the course of the film are fast and amusing though i did tire of john tv-styled klutziness colleen camp dorothy stratten and the grounded earthy-sensual patti hansen are all exciting to watch but really valentine and she absolutely glows from
one of the all-time great science fiction works as visionary and thought-provoking as blade runner or even own brazil willis gives his best performance here but outdone by incredibly frenetic turn unlike anything done before or since even stowe isn't out of her league here though the story is very layered and offers quite a lot to think about the climactic scene is beautifully magnificent and the last lines fit perfectly the scenes in the mental hospital are creepy and yet so funny in their own way lots of dark humour on display here fantastic production design and suitably bizarre cinematography in my top ten
i finally purchased and added to my collection a copy of show people i cannot comment any more than what previous viewers have stated and to the characters plot and overall quality of this film without repeating their own words seeing the cameo out-of-character appearances of so many m-g-m silent stars is worth the viewing in and of itself i really like the scene where marion davies plays herself and is encountered by herself playing the main character of the movie patricia pepoire make sure you read her lips as there is no title card indicating what she is saying when she sees marion davies but it is something to the effect of i don't think i like her pop the corn pop in the tape and get ready to go back more than three quarters of a century in movie making history enjoy
i first saw this movie in the theater when i was years old and it still cracks me up the muppets are so cool and they approach show business in a refreshingly naive way my favorite scene is when the rats start a whispering campaign on behalf of kermit at a fancy restaurant this is one smart and funny movie for kids and parents alike long live kermit miss piggy and the rest of the gang
chase has created a true phenomenon with the sopranos unfaltering performances rock-solid writing and some great music make up what has become quite possibly the best show of the cast are strong but falco and gandolfini earned every inch of those anyone who doubts this need only sample a few episodes particularly from the first few seasons james gandolfini is absolutely fierce absolutely terrifying and you still find yourself loving him mesmerized by people that i've spoken to about the sopranos haven't seen it yet will say i'm just not a fan of mafia whatever run don't walk and get it those same people usually love but i bet they don't much care for hospitals not about the context
gung ho tries to express many ideas and entertain us with a wiseguy comedy at the same time the result is uneven but generally entertaining keaton balances all three aspects of his lead character quite well wantabedde is even better one warning george wendt is very poor in his supporting role otherwise this is quite enjoyable time capsule
this film is fantastic as it explores storytelling and fantasy in the way a child would for adults the idea of a drawings becoming a place she can physically visit and have influence over is wonderful at the same time you could get all child psychologist about it and say really exploring her subconscious just as we all do in our dreams when we sleep the bit that gives me goose-pimples is when her dad is in the paper house and chases her the only thing i can't stand is that it was marketed as a horror really isn't if you want to see something british with plenty of storyline which keeps you guessing without the usual cheap thrills most films have to use then watch paperhouse
i don't see how this show is like the oc at all of all the oc centers around teenagers and their parents trying to get through life north shore is about a hotel staff who is trying to run the hotel and have a social life at the same time second the oc takes place in california north shore takes place in why would fox make a show just like one of its other shows on the same network i think this is a great show with good actors for the most part it has a good storyline and plot i like the events that happen and how the people take care of them and work them out the most recent episode was surprising how the story worked out it wasn't predictable like most stories on most shows hope fox keeps it on the air
this movie is very hilarious and it has a great compilation of actors like william h macy which always have perform this kind of roles maybe his most representative fargo and george clooney which is a very good actor showing his comedian work in brothers cohen film oh brother where art thou which results to be one of my favorite movies ever but been hard to find welcome to collinwood here in mexico my city lacks of good places where to buy some good films i tried to buy it at blockbuster but they don't know it by the original name so maybe it will be a little easier to find if i have the name they gave to it in mexico do someone knows it because i can't remember cheers a
some people might call paulie a kids movie but i wish to assert that more than that probably more than anything else this movie successfully goes to great lengths to show the plight of immigrants in the united states topical given the recent debates portraying a parrot telling a russian immigrant janitor shalhoub of how he searched america for his original owners the movie tells several stories the elderly woman rowlands whom he befriends then a mexican immigrant marin and in all a very well done movie i usually don't expect much from these sorts of movies but this one is a treat i certainly recommend it also starring jay mohr buddy hackett bruce davison hallie eisenberg and trini alvarado
went to see this finnish film and i've got to say that it is one of the better films i've seen this year the intrigue is made up of different stories all taking place the very same day in a small finnish town the stories come together very nicely in the end reminding perhaps a bit of the way movies are made most of the actors performed very well which most certainly is needed in realistic dramas of this type i especially enjoyed the acting by sanna hietala the lead actress and juha kukkonen i noticed btw that imdb has got the wrong information about sanna her name as you might have noticed in my review is not heikkilä but hietala
i remember this movie quite intense for an year old good editing i felt terrible for the st bernard i'd watch it again if it were rebroadcast but the signal is passing pluto as i write this robert culp a highlight of his career i am just glad i didn't live in that neighborhood oh those what a decade if they remade it i bet it would be very violent and bloody so what are they waiting for an excellent movie for pre-pubescent suburban boys it was very intense i think it was filmed in los angeles certainly not made in lodi nj the shot with the st bernard was the best and obviously the most haunting image from the then they left the carcass on the stoop rotten kids
this last dutch speaking film of verhooven made me laugh good as a film buff looking for all the small details and cross references etc in any movie i can assure anyone interested in film art that this piece amuses all the senses i haven't read gerard reves book on which the film is based but i still believe we get a candid picture of a somewhat self-conceited who gets his a way no spoiling here an anti-hero surrounded by characters that have their ambiguous intentions as has he all this in a superbly packaged cinematography paul verhopven manages to turn the otherwise rather cute dutch locations into a suspenseful film-noir setting impressive work
for those who think it is strictly potty humor and immaturity you are in fact the mindless one while the show does contain its share of potty jokes it also contains a lot of satirical material and pokes fun at social problems racial barriers etc you just need to read into some of her material a bit more to get i also love is that not everything is a punchline for those expecting a formulated joke like friends love friends fyi you won't find it here instead sarah uses situations and other ways to achieve her humour which is more realistic we don't walk around in this world and have witty punchlines for everything said which is in most comedies instead the sarah silverman program makes it more realistic in this sense don't take it as mindless humor because it is so much more than that
i have not read the other comments on the film but judging from the average rating i can see that they are unlikely to be very watched it for the second time with my children they absolutely loved it true it did not have the adults rolling around the floor but the sound of the enjoyment made it seem is a true mel brooks farce with plenty of moral content how sad it is to be loved for our money not for whom we are and how fickle are our friends and associates there are many other films on a similar subject matter no doubt many of which will have a greater comic or emotional impact on adults hard for me to imagine such an impact on the junior members of the family for the children a from me
i'd even say some shades of is clearly better than mmm which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most woody fans by the way did you know that annie hall was first conceived as a murder mystery anyhow woody reclaims some relevance in film comedy with this one the plot turns are nice and tight i will say that in the first minutes or so some of the actors are a little too hasty at delivering their lines but stick around scarlett johansson proves well-cast in the diane keaton-type role and at no time is there any uncomfortable moments between her and the much older woody no one could imagine a more perfect actor for the role of peter lyman than jackman
here in brazil is very rare to see a good brazilian film and new film is exactly one of these jewel there are some flaws in the film of course but they are very minimal the directing and acting in this film are very wait to see another new film
since death and absence the show has been left in the incapable hands of richard roeper roeper is not a film critic he just criticizes anything he doesn't like personally films with country music get panned because i don't like country music and movies get a standard don't see it now wait until it comes out on dvd and rent it for your kids roeper may well be an idiot savant but in some other field the weekly guests for ebert fare better but who wants to pick a daisy in the midst of a cow pat all that said it is the only show in town and that alone makes it worth watching as for roger ebert if stephen hawking can talk so can you your mind and thoughts we long for do whatever is necessary to get that usurper off his self-declared throne
this is no art-house film mainstream entertainment of beautiful people and action i found it very entertaining not supposed to be intellectually stimulating a fun film to watch jesse and chace are funny too which is just gravy definitely worth a in summary i'd recommend checking it out for a little friday night entertainment with the boys or even your girl she likes to see other girls get it villains are good too vinnie corey large the hatian guy from heroes very nasty villains
i found the memorable quotes searching for video clips they forgot one of my person you know i remember the first time they played that thing person you remember pterodactyls person and i can remember you fell for that hook line and sinker person oh i did not lady you did so you put a big bucket on your head and took off with them army boys to fight martians person ain't you dead yet
another is a best wuxie film i'm ever seen woo rulez forever some hollywood moments john woo greater director of the hi is not more intellectual than lot of big directors but he is lyrical and spiritual idol of all free-mind people movies like the great poetry woo is a movie sheakspeare woo is a movie biron woo is a mozart of violent in woo films is not a directors bloodlust but a instrument of art themes of woo movies is more humanistic that more of the new films
i really liked this film all three and underwood give credible harris is enjoyably over the top the lighting and shot angles in some of harris scenes make his face look truly diabolical the surprising turn of plot at the end makes it interesting not a great movie but an enjoyable one i gave it of
for those who commented on the patriot as being accurate basically satanised the english it was interesting to see this film by all accounts this was the bloodiest war that americans have ever been involved in and they were the only nationality present it was therefore very refreshing to see something resembling historical accuracy coming from that side of the atlantic that did not paint america as either martyrs or saviours all in all though what this film did bring home was the true horrors of any conflict and how how whatever acts are committed in war only breed worse acts often culminating in the suffering of the innocent this was not a film where you cheered anybody on but both pitied and loathed all
space camp is a pretty decent film the plot is predictable but the actors do a good job and the special effects are decent for the film was originally released about the time of the shuttle disaster and that really put a hamper on how popular it scene where the shuttle doors open in space is simply spectacular on the big screen that is on a tv it just looks average i remember this scene in the theater it made you feel like you were really up would be a good film to see on imax but i'm sure that will never happen
what can i say an action and allegorical tale which has just about everything basically a coming of age tale about a young boy who is thrust into a position of having to save the world and more he meets a dazzling array of heroes and villains and has quite a time telling them apart a definite must-see
pet sematary is a very good horror film and believe it or not somebody can make a good horror film out of a stephen king novel mary lambert does a great job with this film and manages to bring across creepy story pretty well most people may avoid this but they should check it out
there were some great moments of reality in there depicting modern day life only in japan but everywhere it shows how stifling ones culture can be and wanting to break out of the mold its created for dancing was just a vehicle for saying do what you love even if its against the norm rather billy elliot like i would say i enjoyed that film as well humour was well timed and the touching moments felt so real you could feel the awkwardness between sugiyama and his wife the tantrums in the dance hall i loved aoki him and that wig and his excessiveness on the dance floor made me simply actors all did a wonderful job the story was well written i watched it a second time and caught some little nuances that i missed on the first viewing good entertainment
this is a really good film and one that i've enjoyed watching several times michael awesome as always michael caine has received kind of a reputation for taking any role in any movie no matter what the quality or lack of same but he does a good turn in playing sidney from the start so well written who would have thought that ira levin who wrote such creepy stuff as the boys from brazil and baby could write something this witty face it michael caine chris reeve dyan cannon henry jones how are you going to go wrong with a cast this good directed by sidney really reticent to go on because if anyone were to give away anything about this film it would be a crime just watch it and adore it
this movie has it all action fighting dancing bull riding music pretty girls this movie is an authenic look at middle america believe me i was there in lots of oil money lots of women and lots of honky tonks too bad they are all gone now the movie is essentially just another boy meets girl boy loses girl boy gets girl back but it is redeemed by the actors and the music there is absolutely no movie with any better music that this movie and that includes american graffiti it is a movie i watch over and over again and never get tired of it every time i watch it i am young again and it is time to go out honky tonking the only reason i only gave it a is because you cannot rate a movie zero i do not feel you should rate one
the last command is a silent film directed by josef von shows us czarist general grand duke sergius alexander jannings in his days of he had all the power but after the revolution and the collapse of imperial russia he has also had the love of a woman natalie dabrova ten years later he applies for a small part in a film about the old enemy lev andreyev powell is the director who gets to choose whether to hire him as a film extra or last command is very good silent jannings does memorable role work in the brent is wonderful playing the woman powell is great as are plenty of scenes to remember in this many scenes with jannings and then there is the ending with powell and is a movie that touches in many parts
sure the history in this movie was far from being the only bit of history rewritten for the masses lafitte sided with the americans because he considered himself a frenchman and therefore hated the british not because of any sense of patriotism for a nation that had taken over new orleans only a short time ago he broke his agreement and returned to smuggling which caused his sailing to galveston he was more of a petty criminal and scoundrel than a hero a swashbuckler but who cares this is one movie sheer face it we all wanted jean to go for the feisty wench rather than the prudish daughter of the governor brynner once again rises over mediocre writing to give a fascinating performance
the title is onomatopoeic the sound of a streetcar clacking on the rails it is metaphoric for all that the people who live in the dump cannot have the misery of those people is illustrated by the passing streetcar which represents the relatively unobtainable rich life of the middle class the pathos of the little boy and his beloved yet sadly insane father is most touching this was first film in colour and he uses beautifully shocking hues colours seen only in dreams the movie is surreal and surpassing in beauty the compassion for humanity is the underling force but as always kurosawa is focused on capturing the beauty of the film it is a masterwork by a genius of cinema
wow how can i even discuss this movie without tears coming to my eyes it was surely the highlight of my life as if the raptor graphics weren't amazing enough the award-winning editors continued to use the exact same shot throughout the entire movie even when the background didn't actually match up with the setting of the scene wow what genius and while the movie is full of plot-holes instance a few clips of a t-rex type animal where a raptor should be and one key moment where pappy finds a torture chamber screams a girl and runs out i will never forget the brilliance that is raptor planet thank you sci-fi for another classic
my god masterpiece is one of the best movies i've ever seen closer to peter greenaway and jean-luc movies this one is really disturbing but not gruesome as the nekromantiks all the little stories have a deep philosophic interest and the directing is totally inventive in spite of the lack of money the bridge sketch highly highly recommended
it is finally coming out the first season will be available march it is currently airing on abc family from pm eastern time monday through friday the last episode will air on december at i missed it the first times around i wish i could buy the whole series right now who does she pick i have to write lines in order to reply to the first comment what am i going to say la da da de de la da da de de nope only up to how do i get to almost almost awww now i need i missed counted this is only number punky brewster is pretty awesome too almost to almost awwwwww
this movie is amazing the plot was was very surprised by and performance after growing up in the american world of the actors who can't sing and singers who can't this movie a young sho comes across a vampire kei over time they form an unlikely friendship kei is suffering because of how he is forced to live off others the half-life of a a sad movie but not sappy the plot was very unique and contrary to your typical vampire flick the storyline was thick with twists and turns and very only fault i would say the movie had despite lack of a would be multiple languages i had the unsubdued version lucky that i understood it all save some of the cantonese so i would recommend getting something with in all the movie was just awesome
a vow to cherish is a wonderful movie based on a novel of the same title which was equally good though different from the film really made you think about how you'd respond if you were in the shoes of the characters recommended for anyone who has ever loved a parent spouse or family other words the production isn't quite hollywood big special the values and ideals portrayed more than make up for it and the cast did a wonderful job of capturing the emotional connections between family members and the devastation that occurs when one of them becomes don't want to miss this
i like cheap perfume better it doesn't last as long ralph convict character tells this to barbara helen character after he gets a whiff of the perfume that she picked out husband in tijuana this line cracked me up and also seemed like a metaphor for this film that cheap is better than expensive because a cheap perfume-loving man who has a way with a x is a better man to have around in the long run i agree with some of the other comments posted about attraction to lawson even though her narration states that she wants lawson to be put away she did seem attracted to his fiery nature and that passion he stirred up in her wouldn't likely wash away with the tide
not a film to be taken seriously but a great little film definitely not just a piece of fluff the acting imo is of those films you wouldn't go out of your way to see but it brings a smile every time it comes around on cable like an old worth seeing if you get the
i saw this at the mill valley film festival hard to believe this is ms directorial debut it is beautifully paced and performed large cast of characters could be out of an anne tyler novel they are layered with back story and potential futures there are no false notes surprising bursts of humor amidst self-inflicted anxiety and very real if not earth-shattering dilemmas if you saw the best of youth you will recognize how well drawn the characters are through small moments even as the story moves briskly along i really hope this gets distribution in the usa i live in a fairly sophisticated film market yet we rarely get swedish films of any kind
sure it may not be a classic but one full of classic lines one of the few movies my friends and i quote from all the time and this is fifteen years later it was on cinemax one too many times michael keaton is actually the worst actor in this can't seem to figure out how to play but surrounded by a fantastic cast who know exactly how to play this spoof looking for a movie to cheer you up this is it but rent it with make it even better
after tracking it down for half a year i finally found a copy and it was not disappointing because i'm one of those die hard smap fans who need to see all their works and i finally got to see the so called hot film of goro but i couldn't believe goro was forced to make a movie as such in his respectable self now i'm sure he cringes that he made this movie nevertheless they found the perfect person for looking embarrassed ill at ease and half depressed most of the i still can't believe he made this had to cover my eyes at many parts not believing he really made such a i'm glad to have watched it thank goodness he has grown up
this movie is very cool if you're a fan of tsui hark and chinese fantasy films you should love this this film is the asian lord of the rings a high fantasy story based in actual chinese mythology realize many critics have called this film plot-less i think they probably have zero knowledge of chinese mythology if you liked stormriders or warriors of heaven earth this one should be right up your alley this film is still very difficult to find in the even though it was purchased for distribution along with crouching tiger hidden dragon and iron monkey well worth the search this dvd is also worthy of owning
okay this has been a favourite since i was granted i don't watch it multiple times a year anymore but this is not a movie for an older generation who want a deeper meaning or some brilliant message this movie is fun pretty dated almost passe but parker posey is so brilliant that unbelievable if you want to be charmed by a breakfast at attended raves or love parker this movie is for you otherwise don't bother
this has to be the funniest stand up comedy i have ever seen eddie izzard is a genius he picks in brits americans and everyone in between his style is completely natural and completely hilarious i doubt that anyone could sit through this and not laugh their off watch enjoy funny
this is and this way underrated gem has lost nothing of the power it had years ago it connects a pretty wide variety of different characters and stories without appearing to be and music might have changed over time but in the end this is a story that will never lose its up-to-dateness and especially this movie does the job pretty well of course it is cheesy at times but very touching as performance is striking and it shows that she is really a natural born actress who showed her true potential especially in her earlier miss this one
a masterful treatment of james the postman always rings twice as luchino first film shot primarily around ferrara in a soulless war-torn italy the original negative was thought destroyed but visconti saved a print and fortunately we can see this early neo-realist work today a ruggedly handsome massimo girotti and clara calamai had recently revealed her breasts in la cena delle beffe star as the sensually-charged and ill-fated lovers who plot to kill her husband unusual ending in which although crime does not pay one pays in a way not directly linked to the crime excellent direction script acting and cinematography reportedly not as good as the french le dernier tournant but probably better than the us version featuring lana turner and john garfield in the lead roles highly recommended
i am not a huge fan of camp kitsch and the so bad good type of viewing however i really like this film for its fun factor and believe it or not whole thing has a ring of john waters and is boundlessly enthusiastic but with some superb actors and considered direction making the most of the slapstick and styalised movements billy zane moves with incredible expression the scene on the bus for a text-book lesson in how to use movement and is framed by some unexpected may not like this film you may not enjoy it but if you get the chance to watch it then spare the time because chances are you will end the film with a confused smile on your face and a new perspective on the sense of humour of some big stars highly reccomended
i've watched this movie twice and i plan to see it again it is the movie that puts you in the place regarding his romantic relations and the political situation in israel it also makes me cry because of remembering the wonderful time it was and the horrible murder described there it is really worth watching
i thought the movie was actually pretty good i enjoyed the acting and it moved along well the director seemed to really grasp the story he was trying to tell i have to see the big budget one coming out today obviously they had a lot more money to throw at it but was very watchable when you see a movie like this for a small budget you have to take that in to account when you are viewing it there were some things that could of been better but most are budget related the acting was pretty good the and stunts were well done a couple of standouts were the guy who played the camera asst and the boy who played the child these kind of films have kept la working and this is one that turned out ok
branagh is one of the few who understands the difference between a film and a play hamlet is probably the most faithful adaptation of shakespeare to a film and yet is a very dynamic film almost an action thriller the scene of meeting with his ghost won't leave your mind
this movie blew me away if you can see only one of the animated bug movies this year see this one instead of antz the plot characters and jokes are better in a bugs life also when you go stay in your seat until the end of the credits the best part of the movie rating
that was definitely the case with angels in the outfield it was on tv last night and i believe i hadn't seen the film since my sophomore year in high school and i'm now in my year of college although the film has many flaws it is just so touching that you can't help but sit down watch it and enjoy yourself it is also hilarious danny ranting is just so over the top that you can't help but laugh out loud at him at most time it adds to the film and i'm sure exactly what the director wanted you actually feel for the characters in the film even though the development isn't the best a must see i highly
i really loved this version of emma the best kate beckinsale was awesome as emma and mark strong was very good as knightly the only complaint that i had was on mr can't believe that a man could whine so much or be so selfish with his was a smart girl in the end though as always i love the places in which these jane austin movies were shot the settings are so spectular it makes me want to visit england so much well as ireland and scotland i think the actors chosen for this movie were a good choice as well and all the other story lines interwhined with most excellently i am glad that i got to see this one as well
i gave this film out of reserving for amadeus and for slumdog millionaire most recently this film is close to slumdog but it is difficult to judge on such film without understanding balkan life mentality and a soul which kusturica presents masterfully to understand it you really need to be one of balkan this is an amazing movie much better and more contemporary of his previous films which are boring at this time i think kusturica is moving forward with this movie i like humour humour photography is an art itself each scene is artistic to the limit plot is probably a fairy tale don't recall it now but remember reading to my daughter-going-to sleep a similar story
ok so an adult movie but it really is very tastefully done obvious that the producers spent a lot of time and money into making a classy sort of movie i was pleasantly surprised at just how good it was even the acting was fairly decent the plot was more solid than most adult films i've seen the camera work was above average just a good flick
a female executioner by the sexy jennifer thomas ii has the fun job of fulfilling all the fantasies of all the men on death row before they meet their maker and what a way to go lucky this film is not real or we would have a lot more people in this world on death starts out real slow low light and bad acting like most films it gets better as it moves along and ends with a would rate it very high on the low cost very sexy movies of the a must see once the kids are away or in bed
with this movie all about style atmosphere and acting true i didn't believe all of the plot developments but it didn't the terrific acting the unexpected plot twists and the wonderful atmosphere sucked me right in and carried me along for the ride and i had a great time kenneth branagh is not only a great actor but a master of accents and he proves it once again with a flawless georgia accent surrounded by so much talent in supporting roles downey jr embeth davidtz from list and fallen tom berenger daryl hannah and robert duvall that i was simply blown away i recently bought a copy of this movie and i never tire of watching it simply one of the best thrillers of the year if you've ignored this movie chances are you have then i suggest you check it out
beside the fact that in all awesomeness this movie has risen beyond all my expectations this masterpiece of cinema history portrait the overuse of crappy filters in best paul johansson and craig sheffer show a brotherconflict with all there is to it as usual a woman concieling her true intentions the end came as surprising as unforssen as the killing of keith scott by his older scenes in wiking land are just as i remember it from my early time travels to be honest my strong passion for trash movies makes this one a must have in my never finished recommend this movie to all the people in love with the most awesome brother cast from one tree
henry thomas was great his character held my attention i was so into the story that i forgot it wasn't real i wanted him to keep the baby and see what a special person he was the other people in the story were essential in the makeup of his character the way they banded together to help one another was truly awe inspiring i love movies that show the real side of human emotions without having to hit you over the head in that you are not smart enough to figure things out for yourself
had a bad day dog bit the mailman car wouldn't start people got on your nerves then refresh yourself with a delightful women decide to pool their resources in answer to an ad for a rental of a villa in italy due to financial circumstances two other women join them two have humdrum marital lives one is an elderly woman who prefers to live in the past the fourth is a wealthy and beautiful woman wholly jaded by the spell of the villa permeates their spirits each grows in her own way and is uplifted in her outlook this also changes the people in their lives who have visited them as they leave you know the magic of the villa will remain with you will find your outlook altered for the better a delightfully uplifting movie
this is perhaps the best rockumentary a british better this is spinal tap the characters are believable the plot is great and you can genuinely empathise with some of the such as problem with fitting in the soundtrack is excellent real period stuff even if it is in the same key you'll be humming some of the songs for days what i liked was the nearly all-british cast with some of the favourite household names wife is film never drags it just goes at the right pace and has some genuinely funny sections in it a generator of some really good a hidden diamond
i loved it having been a fan of the original series i have always wondered what the back story would be it didn't fail to delight me i also love the fact that apart from eric stoltz i didn't recognise one person this is refreshing much like bsg it has introduced me to a whole wealth of new talent can't wait for the series to start airing well done to ronald d moore and team excellent job the special effects dialogue and acting were all spot on and i felt emotionally tied up in the storyline i know there are purists out there that will probably disagree with my assessment but i felt that caprica was far superior to most of the sci-fi stuff produced in the last decade
soylent green is a classic i have been waiting for someone to re-do seem to be remaking sci-fi classics these days war of the i am hoping some will re-do soylent green with todays computer animation and technology it would have the potential to be a great picture anti-utopian films may not be that far-fetched the human race breeds like roaches with no outside influence to curtail it we as humans have the option of putting the kibosh on the procreation of lesser species if they get out of hand but nothing to control human breeding except for ourselves despite all the diseases wars abortions birth control etc the human race still multiplies like bacteria in a petri dish classic malthusian economics states that any species including humans will multiply beyond their means of subsistence billion and obscene
show favorites green arrow this season aquaman in season impulse and cyborg all come together along with clark to stop one of evil plans in this thrilling mid-season his sophisticated technology green arrow learns that lex luthor is constructing laboratories across the world that hold people induced by the meteor substance kryptonite and people with abilities to run tests on green arrow over the past months has allied arthur curry bart allen and victor stone to stop lex and destroy these facilities after recruiting clark to help the team puts on quite a show in interrogating and destroying a local episode is incredible full of action humor and fabulous dialog it feels more like a movie it is full of entertainment and provides as a springboard for the most interesting storyline of the sixth season
most movies about or set in new orleans turn out to be laughably bad and laughably inaccurate remember the savage bees but i'll make an exception for tightrope which almost got it one that doesn't inevitably get it wrong the accents are not too bad the yat accent down here is way more brooklynese than southern the city of is shown the way it without the obligatory tourist shots and they understand a good drama without trying to make everyone a quirky southerner of the few films to do justice to this city and a good film to boot
my kasi lemmings certainly is a fair looking woman this film is a lost gem a dead-on satire mockumentary of the early hip hop scene when mc hammer had just began to fade away into that good night we follow the three members of the nwh as they embark upon their picaresque journey of would-be riches and fame and like nickolas nickleby at the end they finish their journey not far from where they started but at least a little wiser and lot less naive this is one of the best films that no one has ever heard of but the kind of film you either love or hate a lot like company man in this regard i regard this movie like the islands of upstate new york a wonderful little secret you want to keep to yourself
i was drawn to dan in real life from the excellent reviews and the thirst for a dramedy that was well written-thank you peter hedges-and because when steve carell stars in the film you know an audience is going to find like in little miss sunshine a performance that is very entertaining and rewarding dan in real life delivered that film is so real to many families world wide that have lost a member and yet have gone on with their lives in search of something that will give them the magic back before their loss with steve carell and the wondrous juliette binoche their relationship was so beautifully done and written that their scenes were so real to their characters and to their journeys the cast sets and story made dan in real life one to remember as we head into the holidays ahead
this typical mamet film delivers a quiet evenly paced insight into what makes a confidence man mantegna good explored as a psychological study by a noted psychologist crouse it slowly pulls her into his world with the usual nasty consequences the cast includes a number of the players found is several of films goldstein jack wallace ricky jay andy potok allen soule william h macy and they do their usual good job i loved lindsay crouse in this film and have often wondered why she didn't become a more noted player than she has become perhaps i'm not looking in the right movie proceeds at a slow pace with flat dialog yet it maintains a level of tension throughout which logically leads to the bang-up ending you'd expect a real let down at the ending but i found it uplifting and satisfying i love this movie
jim carrey can do anything i thought this was going to be some dumb childish movie and it totally was not it was so incredibly funny for everyone adults kids i saw it once cause it was almost out of theatres and now finally coming out on dvd this tuesday and i'm way to excited as you can see you should definitely see it if you haven't already it was so
a heartwarming film the usual superb acting by john thaw who passed over recently a man who was always so unassuming he was one of englands top actors certainly of my can be remembered for his famous role of inspector morse as jack regan in the hit tv series the sweeney and as a barrister in kavanah qc a must see for all the family and a great dvd for my collection the filming will bring back a few memories for people who remember wartime britain and certainly those who were evacuated out of london to escape the german bombings the interaction between the two main and the boy william was really well acted and true to the book by michelle magorian
i've watched it plenty of times and i'm planning on buying the full feature i love all of jason comedy very different and unique and is very enjoyable i love indie films and this one is just great the plot is strange but very funny this short film is about a talking spatula named edward the order of the events are a bit jumbled making this film very interesting to watch at first you see edward fighting the spoons but then the focus changes to earlier in his life this is a silly movie but of course still great i highly recommend that you watch this film at or very funny the humour may not match taste but watch anyway it'll only take minutes of your time and free go watch spatula madness
i remember when i was five and my parents thought it was a regular cartoon when the bras and bullets started flying i have to agree this movie will make anyone and everyone upset because it is set to discriminate everyone and the truth is it is funny as hell as it is deep i recommend this to anyone who likes cult classics also try fritz the cat and the nine lives of fritz the cat if i'm correct ralph bashki did that movie involves a cat that goes through hard times with family etc when i was old enough i rented all of these movies out because coonskin was an offensive title during that era it was also labeled as street fighter ralph bashki also made cool world starring a very young brad pitt heavy traffic was another cartoon that dealt with the street life of a young man
well magic works in mysterious ways this movie about prisoners trying to escape with the help of spells written by another prisoner centuries ago was a superb occult thriller with a surprising end and lots of suspense even if it had something of a theater-play everything happens in the cell it never got boring and it was acted very well in the tradition of cube you felt trapped with the characters and even if they were criminal you developed some sympathy with some of them only to change your mind by the twists the story takes some happenings catched you off guard and there was always a touch of insanity in the air altogether intense and entertaining and as i didn't expect anything friend rented it it was a positive surprise
the most agile fat guy in martial arts does it again an early sammo film that has him imitating his hero bruce lee sammo is amazingly lee like in his actions and fighting the way he slips into style and then back to his own more familiar kung fu is a joy to watch and shows how accomplished and adaptable he is at his art throw in a bit of slapstick humour so beloved of this type of flick and this a movie that has it all comedy unintentional like the fake black guy action and some incredible fight great beer and buddies movie that is worth an hour and a half of time
i thought this movie was really really great because in india cinemas nowadays all you see is skin music and bad this movie you can see some tradition ethnicity and at least some some parts were a little dramatic guess what that is what indian cinema is all about after watching this movie at least you don't get a headache from all the loud overrated music or any violence its just the truth it teaches about love and of course caring for the person you love throughout think it was an amazing can watch it without a doubt and adults will enjoy the simplicity that used to be sure all these rap hits miniskirts and skin showing became a part of it
the film version of alice hugely emotive and influential novel largely as letters from the central character celie to god was a massive oscar success and rightly the role of the abused and awakened celie whoopi goldberg gave her best screen performance by miles not far behind her was oprah winfrey as sofia the fiery woman tamed by fate others in the cast fleshed out the characters walker had introduced so clearly on the page danny glover as albert abusive husband margaret avery as shug a force of change for the good willard pugh and rae dawn chong as harpo and squeak susan beaubian as corrine the wife and the much-missed carl anderson best known as judas in the film of jesus christ superstar as preacher paced and sensitively written the color purple does justice to its source while opening out the story to involve viewers of a feature-length drama
fido is a cute comedy that deserves wider recognition especially considering the mainstream crap that is supposed to entertain us these has already been pointed out this is hardly a real zombie film but rather a sweet satire that employs the undead to point fingers while there are necessarily some bloody scenes there is almost no gore and the way this movie is presented style i can't imagine anyone being actually scared or turned off by fido his fellow the cast is generally good i felt that moss and nelson stood out the humor is not in-your-face but rather subdued a lot of attention to detail and i caught myself smiling benignly several throughout the movie this is certainly no masterpiece of cinema but it doesn't strive to be instead currie succeeds in delivering a heart-warming black comedy
actually the answer only occupies a tiny portion of this excellent imax movie that educates us on our delicate selves and special by display the inner outer workings of an average human be it adult men and women boys and girls or babies nearly every human body part aspect is specifically detailed digestion reproduction a marvin gaye hit the heart etc some especially revealing moments include how an infant can be immersed underwater and also how the impulses look it is amazing how we subject matter skips around an awful lot but at all times we still learn a hell of a lot about our bodies that we should be to know
good old black and white graham greene based people in dangerous times doing heroic and mysterious things hardly a shot fired or a punch thrown and a hundred time more interesting than the glop being minted by hollywood today bacall lights up the screen of course and boyer is entirely engaging they don't make movies like this any more
after reviewing this intense martial arts movie for the first time in nearly years i must say it did not lose any of its mysticism nor any of its eye-popping martial arts action as i had remembered from my youth the story of a dying martial arts instructor sending his unfinished pupil out to find the past members of his poison clan so they do not seek out a fortune which the friend keeps hidden afraid that his last pupil did not have enough training he instructs him to befriend one of the five venoms so as to defeat the other can't say enough about the choreography or the camera work a fine film in its own right and quite possible one of the best martial arts movies ever made a classic
great actors an oscar nominee actress stunning scenery good strong story line and more laughs than you can fit into my new handbag thats quite big this film was brilliant it was beautifully acted in the more serious scenes and the funny moments were well side splitting i have never heard a cinema audience laugh so much and tears were streaming down my cheeks during the stoned ladies in the tea shop scene well done to the british film industry and to craig ferguson whose magic ingredients have made sure this is one of my favourite films of the year if not of all time
this program is a lot of fun and the title song is so catchy i can't get it out of my head i find as i get older i am drawn to the wrinklies who get things done and these four are excellent in their endeavors some of what they do is outrageous but brilliant considering that now days with our pc world we'd never be able to do it in real life i always learn something from the shows but if you like mystery drama comedy and a little forensic work you'll love this show it reminds me of quincy me in one way and barney miller in another the way they work and inter-react with each other they screw up a lot but they get the job done and what counts
well i had seen they all laughed when it came out around and had kept a vague but dear souvenir of it i ve just seen it again on tape almost twenty years after bogdanovich has a true heartfelt tenderness over his characters and a kind sympathy which is difficult not to feel also excellent comedians and actors good lines all over and for everyone and pretty good editing too i laughed and smiled all the time just as we all do at times go get it
despite being told from a british perspective this is the best ww ii documentary ever produced presented in digestible digestible as war can be episodes as the grave voice of laurence olivier connects the multitudes of eye witnesses who were forced to live the events of that horrific time eagerly awaiting its appearance on dvd in the the europeans had their opportunity with a release in dvd earlier this year
simply put this is the best movie to come out of michigan since well ever evil dead eat your heart out hatred of a minute was some of the oddest and best cinema to be seen by this reviewer in a long time i recommend this movie to anyone who is in need of a head trip or a good case of the willies
this one and her pilgrim soul are two of my favorite episodes in this new version of twilight zone as i mentioned in my comment on the new series something lacking in this new series maybe they emphasize too much the lesson that has to be learned a little bit more mawkish and sentimental than version however this episode can be considered as quite sentimental too i think the appeal is that no matter what they do the lovers can never unite i remember i wasn't surprised by the korean movie il mare remade into the lake house i think because i saw this episode first so it ruined the impact of the later film
i'm so you probably would think i have never heard of george burns or walter matthau or anyone like that boy are you wrong i had heard that george burns was in this movie and that he won an academy award for it i have been a fan of george burns since i was ten i saw the movie oh god recently and loved it this one was also very awesome george burns did a great job so did walter is the first time i've ever seen him perform and even though they had really small roles phyllis diller and steve allen did a good job that special they were filming would have been awesome if it was really done let me say this if you are a fan of george burns or walter matthau you should see this movie right away
a really great movie and true story dan jansen the greatest skater ever a touching and beautiful movie the whole family can enjoy the story of jane jansens battle with cancer and dan jansen love for his sister of a important promise made by jansen to win a gold medal to prove his sister jane was right to believe in his talent in speed skating was justified this picture is well worth the time i wish they would make more films of this quality thank you for a great film with excellent actors and an excellent story it is a very touching story about a beautiful family support and faith for their children and a special dream for their youngest son and his sister
i can't believe we don't have that show anymore i have all seasons of that show i absolutely love it i lay in the bed every night and watch several episodes before i go to sleep at the end of a long busy day nice to kick back and have a great laugh before you go to sleep i was so sad they took the show off air at least we still have the re-runs i am hoping and praying they will come back with at least a maybe when donna finishes college and we finally get to see her and eric get married wouldn't that be awesome it would be even better if they would continue it for several years
there is great detail in a life everything is covered the film looks great and the animation is sometimes jaw-dropping the film isn't too terribly orignal basically a modern take on seven samurai only with bugs i enjoyed the character interaction however and the bad guys in this film actually seemed bad it seems that disney usually makes their bad guys carbon copy cut-outs the grasshoppers are menacing and hopper the lead bad guy was a brillant creation check this one out
if you find yourself in need of an escape something that will hold your attention for two hours and allow you to be lost in another world domino will satisfy that need this is entertainment after all the plot keeps your brain in motion one of those movies usual suspects where you want to see it a second time to figure it all out i wondered about domino harvey herself how her life became of interest to hollywood as for the acting lots of celebrity appearances not shown in the trailers and any actor that makes me forget who they are has done their job well not once did i think of kiera in a soccer uniform or pirate costume and granted mickey rourke plays mickey rourke well and often but here despite the violence he shows signs of being capable of caring for other people

this is an excellent film with an extraordinary cast and acting i was very disappointed with the academy awards when this didn't get the oscar for best film and for best actress goldberg it certainly deserved it in any case take a look at it i am sure you will enjoy it very much
i am one of witnesses and i also work in an acute care medical facility over the years i have seen people die from hemolytic reactions to blood transfusions have attended numerous conferences on blood born pathogens and have seen several patients become seriously ill from pathogens induced by transfused blood i have also heard several witnesses being told that they will die if they refuse blood and after years in the field i have never actually seen it happen leaving the question is it really unreasonable to refuse blood transfusions or is the community at large benefiting from the battle on this issue the issue for witnesses is a moral one you must abstain from blood is not an ambiguous statement thank you for this movie and allowing comments on it
my first child was born the year this program came out and i played the record album for the boys every christmas thereafter when the cd came out i bought about ten copies and still give them to friends and relatives as they start invariably becomes their favorite christmas album i recently found several on dvd-r from video tapes probably for sale on ebay the one i bought was an excellent copy and it was so great to see the show again after more than years there are some songs on the show that were not on the album and some of the songs on the album were studio versions of the same songs on the show but both the cd and dvd will stay in our library as the best christmas entertainment ever
no other movie has made me feel like this before and i don't feel bad like i don't want my money back or the time that i waited to watch this movie months nor do i feel bad about using two hours of a sunny summer day in order to view this the reason i say is because no matter how hard i wrack my brain i just can't seem to come up with a word in any of the seven languages that movie was in to sum it up i have no idea what was going on the entire time and half way through the movie i needed a breather no movie has ever done this to me before never in my life have i wanted cauliflower milk and baguettes this much thank you no words no thoughts i don't know i truly don't know cait
running man isn't a great movie in fact kinda silly but it delivers what you want in an arnie movie and that is action and entertainment i don't see how anyone couldn't enjoy this picture so silly and over the top that it almost makes fun of itself by the way this is probably one of the most quotable arnie movies out there
excellent farce which of course is all it is intended to be thankfully there is neither a social or political message nor is there the slightest attempt in that direction could the plot actually take or have taken place in any particular time or location unlikely for after all this is simply merely a movie and movies spring from imagination not from reality the only goal of this movie is to entertain certainly not to educate and entertain it does with reality delightfully and lightheartedly tossed to the winds i think most would agree that from documentaries we expect enlightenment and authenticity but for entertainment i want what is nowadays described as a no-brainer which the mating game is in all respects for a few chuckles and an outright laugh now and then this is fine fare fantasy
i loved this movie first because it is a family movie second because it offers a refreshing take on dealing with the news of hiv in a family with far less hysteria than what i have normally seen in the movies the brothers are very close yet are not judgmental their desire to protect the youngest brother is noble but not needed in the end i understand that choice on how to deal with his treatment may not have been the most popular one with people but i believed it was the right choice for him i can't believe that this was a french television programme it had great production values i gave this movie a ten and i think you will too once you have seen it
buddy is an entertaining family film set in a time when humanizing animals and making them cute was an accepted way to get people to be interested in on a true story buddy shows the great love that the main characters have for animals and for each other and that they will do anything for each not a perfect movie the animated gorilla is quite lifelike most of the time and the mayhem that occurs within the home is usually amusing for film misses an opportunity to address the mistake of bringing wild animals into the home as pets but does show the recommended film which was the first for jim henson productions
billed as the story of steve biko played excellently by denzel washington as you'd expect this was actually more the story of donald woods played by kevin was undoubtedly the making of kline as a serious actor and he was surprisingly good in the gave this the sort of direction you'd expect and the often spectacular scenes of the masses were those of the sort that only he can get remainder of the cast was competent enough and did a good job in what ends up as an ultimately sad tale of a south africa that is still nowhere near the distant past
loved joan great performance what isn't she good in i watched this film and then jane eyre right after she just keeps getting better my heart was racing great old movie drama just what i want from a classic movie facial expressions are worth the whole film i'm glad i have it on video don't know what more you need in a film beautiful costumes are very nice makes me wonder what the budget was for this movie wish they still made films like this whenever they try they just seem to make a cheesy movie films in black and white still hold a certain mystery
quote by nicolas martin from houston tx fine film but dvd reformatted for tv april this is a charming and emotive film on the other hand the dvd i purchased has been reformatted to fit your tv by the clods at columbia tristar there is no excuse for not providing the film in widescreen format except that hollywood treats all films like the moronic disposable trash that it is so used to producing what a a shame indeed however there is another version out though see here for details performances by the two main actors king and doggie btw
i recently bought this movie and i do not regret having it at all as a matter of fact i am very please have this movie to add to my collection matt manfredi and phil hay movie directors took less than one month to film and spent about million eur to produce this great movie this proves that not only big productions make great title of this movie fits in perfectly in computer language bug means program error which causes reactions in computer function our reactions can cause these negative side effects but also great moments of beauty the vertiginous happenings in this movie start with the death of a bug a man witnesses the crime on the other side of the there onwards everything gets point out john carrol lynch wallece the man who cannot make everything right at all
this is a wonderful movie about a brothel in a fishing village that could be best described with scene constellations and direction of old works combined with topics of human psychology sonia marmeladova drama and hans christian tragic and cheerfulness the screenplay is wondrous the scenes are and beautiful some scenes stay really imprinted in my mind the plot is interesting and unpredictable each of the characters is very well developed and interesting there is also a little action so if you don't like all the sentiments you'd also come to your costs it is not about mysterious geishas and proud samurai with their bushido pouring all out of them but about life work and kinds of people found everywhere at any time a lovely and fascinating tribute to kurosawa certainly worth seeing
after becoming completely addicted to six feet under i didn't think there would ever be another show that would come close to being as good as this show well i was wrong lost is spellbinding i absolutely love this show and cannot turn it off the richness of the characters the intricacies of the plot the beautiful setting are all amazing i am totally and completely hooked i don't know how the creators do it but each character touches me very deeply i feel their joy their pain everything right down to my core i don't have cable so i've been renting the series on netflix when i put it on i watch all the episodes at once and feel sad when it is over i can't wait for the next disc to arrive at my house this is probably the best tv show i have ever seen
although the film is the adaptation of the french play the name sorry it is a wonderful portrayal of the cheerful side of georgian character this film will make you to burst into laughter and will fill your heart with warm sadness it will display the overwhelming love of life along with human eccentricities
after her oscar-nominated turn in secrets lies brenda blethyn starred in the equally great saving grace and let me tell you this is not the sort of movie that you find every her husband commits suicide grace trevethyn blethyn discovers that his irresponsible financial decisions have left her with a massive debt fortunately she finds a way to make ends meet marijuana right grace starts cultivating aspect of this movie was played to great effect there isn't a dull moment anywhere in it and i sure didn't see that end scene coming but anyway you gotta see this movie you just might feel more than a little festive after seeing it if nothing else it might function as a good lesson about knowing finances but of course a lot more to it than that
reportedy based on actual historical events this disturbingly violent bloody and shocking period epic sustains viewer interest by creating a verisimilitude missing in the majority of films set in a remote era ms portrayal of the rebellious nun is a tour de force her gradual transformation in character from an obedient if unwilling complicitor in social injustices of her day is adeptly evidenced by telling sequences her witnessing of the hated local casual rapist activity her forbidden love affair with a jew her criminal defection to the invading moslem forces of the sensual prince ahmed corlan there are some painfully realistic gory sequences flaying in this film that are not for the squeamish but viewers with strong stomachs and an interest in medieval history should find ample interest deserves to be seen if only as an antidote to hollywood depictions of the medieval world
for anyone judged others at first meeting here is the perfect tutorial on depth of character the grumpy old lady has a soft thoughtful heart and needs new friends the flighty unsure ditsy dame who makes inappropriate uncomfortable comments sees deep into your soul and has pure love for all the cold prim proper neglected wife has passion simmering that could boil over at any minute given the right setting the perfect beauty rich sweet partying pursued by throngs wants peace quiet and love without possessiveness taking the time to look beyond the surface you will find treasures in everyday life from the least expected sources all it takes is patience and a touch of enchantment
this is without a doubt the greatest film ever made it is nearly incomprehensible even with many repeated viewings in an attempt to figure out what going on the film was almost entirely improvised and includes random musical numbers commercials contests one enters by mail and a host of other innovations besides what other movies have cameos by martin luther king jr to decipher the film hunt down the book entitled i was curious it'll all become clear a grand and bold experiment in improvised recursive filmmaking a triumph now if only someone would put out a version with the subtitles in a color than white subtitles tend to wash out and become invisible
oh so cool to watch a silent classic once in while director vidor is simply delightful and even makes a lengthy least for cameo as himself the story is about having success in life and the way it changes you marion davies plays a girl that leaves its friends in a little comedy studio to be part of a larger drama studio she becomes a big star and the consequences are she really alienates from the real world for a moment she even denies her past the cameos are simply hilarious certainly the scene where the main character davies davies in the studios and concludes she doesn't seem that special got to be one of the first movie-in-the-movies here and for real freaks awesome to see the cameras and material from way back then a must-see if you ask me
this is a wonderful movie with a fun clever story and the dynamics of culture differences and the running theme of important in life make this a very under-appreciated movie don't let the cynics of the world deter you from seeing this keaton has wonderful moments and i wonder at the fact that comedy is never appreciated because actors like keaton make going from humor to serious bits look tremendously easy great movie all around
the odd couple is a comic gem one the funniest script ever committed to celluloid exceeded only by strangelove spinal tap and lebowski lemmon and matthau are best friends obsessive compulsive felix and sloppy irresponsible oscar wife has already left him because he is impossible to live with due to his irresponsible attitude wife leaves him at the start of the movie and after an aborted suicide attempt he moves in with poker buddy oscar thats when the fun entire script is brilliant and filled with brilliant one-liners you are probably already familiar with the joke but it still works brilliantly due to comic favorite moments are when lemmon tries to clear his sinus in the diner and when the pigeon sisters are being charmed by a very suave matthau and lemmon is totally out of his element this one requires repeat viewings
if you want a fun romp with loads of subtle humor then you will enjoy this don't understand why anyone wouldn't enjoy this one take it for what it is a vehicle for dennis hopper to mess with your head and make you laugh it ain't shakespeare but it is well done ericka eleniak is absolutely beautiful and holds her own in this one better than any episode of baywatch and shows a knack for subtle humor too bad she hasn't had many opportunities to expand on berenger fits his role of real navy perfectly and william mcnamara does a solid job as a in a walk-on by hopper in the middle of the chase for the cherry on this sundae and you've got a movie that kept my attention and kept me laughing i bought this one as soon as it was
the sword fighting was out of this world the fights scenes spectacular without the flying on a wire techniques the end that are way too common today the scene with chan and pray was probably the highlight of the movie the characters in the assault on the bad guys mansion were cliché but the movie is comfortable with it an injection of humour from plot with twists and turns was unpredictable and exciting and you couldn't tell who was good or bad or which side people were on good sense of suspense and well timed surprises the depth of the story is quite intense for a flighty film of this genre and reaches you in ways most kung-fu flicks don't
this movie tells an amazing story with history and compassion from the careful descriptions of the crime scenes to the mental health of the lead investigator you'll be entranced an absolute must-see for anyone interested in criminology interpol relations and how the agencies work together are also great not overly done either i recommend it for anyone interested in russian history too how the police work with the political party being what it was it is truly fascinating and frustrating the settings are beautiful been a while since i saw this movie the first time it doesn't diminish impact not overly dramatic or graphic it leaves enough to the imagination well you'll see
okay but just plain dumb not bad for a film i was reading how people switched it with the michael version and that is a good trick in my opinion because some grown ups hate horrors and when they see this one it will get them interested in horror films like this one or maybe seen it the horror comedy uncle sam i'll have to see about renting or buying that film but the is way better then this one but i bought this one on vhs of amazon and got it november the day before thanksgiving worth the four bucks at this
entertaining musical where nathan detroit needs to get up a floating crap game so he entices sky masterson to try and get salvation army girl played by jean simmons to go with masterson to years later simmons would be in the missionary again in the fabulous elmer gantry there she was sister sharon and here she is sister sarah same temperament different sinatra is that devilish nathan detroit he has been engaged to vivian blaine for years and she loathes his gambling a real change of pace sky masterson was played by marlon brando who actually did his own singing film is saved by superlative choreography those dance and singing routines are fabulous they are especially realized by stubby kaye as nicely nicely in all a very nice production
this movie has it all sight gags subtle jokes play on words and verses it is about a rag tag group of boys from different ethnic and social classes that come together to defeat a common enemy if you watch this more than once you will find you are quoting it like animal house yes i love animal house also i put in the top funniest movies the major at a boys military academy is paranoid that every kid is bad and wants to cause trouble this movie he is right he is sadistic uncaring cruel and has to be taken down the group of boys that do not get along at first end up teaming together to survive and get rid of the major with a wacky plan only mad magazine could of wrote a must see you will love it
i saw this movie at the theaters when i was about or years old i loved it then and have recently come to own a vhs version and year old children love this movie and have been asking again and again to watch it have enjoyed watching it again too though i have to admit it is not as good on a little do not have older children so i do not know what they would think of it songs are very cute my daughter keeps singing them over and this helps
after some difficulty johnny yuma arrives at his ailing ranch to take over day to day operations only to find out that the old man has been murdered by his beautiful gold-digger wife and the vicious production values a likable performance by mark damon and a breezy action packed script combine to make this an entertaining if not exceptionally deep above average addition to the spaghetti western rosalba neri is one of the hottest european babes ever to grace the screen here absolutely perfect as the cold-hearted user abuser of weak and neri appeared together in at least one other picture the wedding night a pretty good horror movie of particular interest for those of you that want to see underneath dresses
noni hazlehurst colin friels alice garner chrissie amphlett and michael what more could you ask for monkey grip based on the prize winning novel of the same name explores nora a single mother falling for a heroin addict jobe a simple story is made truly extraordinary through the all round magnificent acting particular noni hazlehurst and nice use of the small budget the only flaw is you can pick it up is that the story is set in melbourne although for budget reasons the film was mainly shot in sydney so as a result in a few scenes you see trams scenes and then a carlton post office scenes other than that monkey grip is a must see the clique but it is at least for an award winning performance from former play school and better homes gardens presenter noni
it surprises me how much i love this movie despite the fact that i don't really like dogs fox field and ameche do a wonderful job with the voices of chance sassy and shadow and the acting by the animals themselves is just have seen this movie times already know that sounds scary but true and every time the ending scenes still get me i highly recommend it to people of all ages and especially to animal lovers it is indeed my all-time favorite movie
the visuals and effects are up to par with the the original film and provide a lot of entertainment even if the storyline is essentially the same as the first two films it also seems a lot more erotically charged than i remember the other films being if you're a big fan of flying prehensile hair and tongues that can reach all the way down into your stomach you'll like this film
i totally got drawn into this and couldn't wait for each episode the acting brought to life how emotional a missing person in the family must be together with the effects it would have on those closest the only problem we as a family had was how quickly it was all explained at the end we couldn't hear clearly what was said and have no idea what part in the whole thing was why did kyle phone him and why did he go along with it having invested in a series for five hours we felt cheated that only five minutes was kept back for the conclusion i have asked around and none of my friends who watched it were any the wiser either very strange but maybe we missed something crucial
with the death of george nader on february i thought of this most interesting program which even though it had only a short run was a tremendous idea with good story lines throughout generally unseen for over years it would be worth viewing again the opening credits showed many differing images one of which was a snippit of colonel john paul stapp riding his famed rocket sled at the point where he was often referred to as the fastest man alive
this movie is all about subtlety and the difficulty of navigating the ever-shifting limits of mores race relations and desire granted it is not a movie for everyone there are no car chases no buildings exploding no murders the drama lies in the tension suggested by glances minimal gestures spatial boundaries lighting and things left sometimes very ostensibly unsaid about identity memory community belonging the different parts of the movie work together to reinforce the leitmotifs of self and other identity desire limits and loss it will reward the attentive and sensitive viewer it will displease those whose palates require explosive massive spicy action it is a beautifully filmed human story that is all
loved the movie loved the two families crossing paths in history only question is if sam gets killed then how does his line continue he is madame son and zero is supposed to be related but no mention of any other children hmmmmmmmmm never mentioned any other children or wife prior to his speaking with and falling in love with the teacher maybe she had a child prior to becoming the kissing kate bandit even with the mistakes in the movie just loved it the acting was great not sure where the story was with mr sir being marion a women at the end but makes his character even funnier the other counseler did seem concerned for the kids but of course maybe not so much poor warden must have had a really stinky childhood to be so mean when she grew up
for a danish movie i have to say that this is very good in a class of its own yet it has an international movie has a big budget and is starring famous danish actors and a few newcomers who play very well it can be watched by anyone who like adventures and a little bit of ghost be afraid be thrilled
i am afraid it was a movie that you have to actually watch to get anything out of t is not a mindless movie like leathal weapon part you know the one where riggs is really crazy it is not a movie that is pretty much the same at the end as it is a the beginning you can run everywhere talk on the phone do what ever and enjoy it in any have noticed in the past that most people that do not like this type of movie are the type that will do most anything but watch a movie and then slam it because duh they don't get it or understand it or what let your doggy take a shower
when i heard about this movie it was supposed to be the funniest thing i've ever seen yes it was funny i mean i liked it all until the end no i can't tell u should it for yourself it is funny except the vulgar language why i say if u like movies that r funny in sexual ways watch it but if not don't waist ur money on renting it or buying it
return to cabin by the lake is perhaps one of the few sequels that can live up to the original it had black humor good suspense nice looking girls and of course a psycho killer what are we missing i think nothing except we are left with a small amount of gore and nudity because it was made for television besides being one of the best sequels it is one of the best thrillers to watch as a family recommended for everyone
richard brooks excellent film of truman novel in cold blood is a perfect companion piece to philip seymour oscar winning performance in the capote they really play well together them on separate nights it is unusual to find films made years apart that mesh so well these two truly enhance each other even though different actors play the roles of killers perry smith and dick hickock the two pieces blend well only the part of the writer by paul stewart in the brooks films is weaker as they give him a different name then capote i'd suggest watching capote first followed by in cold blood it makes for a powerful experience
i truly enjoyed this film the acting was terrific as was the plot jeff combs has more talent than he is recognized for the only part of this flick i would change was the ending the death of the creature was far too gruesome for the sci fi were some interesting religious messages in this film jeff combs obviously played a messiah figure and the creature shark if you prefer represented the anti-chirst there were some particularly frightening scenes that had that end of the world feel i only noticed this after my third viewing of this classic creature feature i know many people won't get the references to christianity but if you watch close you'll get it
this movie is visually stunning who cares if she can act or not each scene is a work of art composed and captured by john derek the locations set designs and costumes function perfectly to convey what is found in a love story comprised of beauty youth and wealth in some ways i would like to see this movie as a tribute to john and bo story commentary would not be complete without mentioning anthony role as father mentor lover and his portrayal of a man of men lost to a bygone era when men were men there are some of us who find value in strength and direction wrapped in a confidence that contributes to a sense of confidence containment and security yes they do not make men like that anymore but then how often do you find women who are made like bo derek
i think this is a lovely family movie there are plenty of hilarious scenes and heart-warming moments to be had throughout the movie the actors are great and the effects well executed throughout danny glover plays george knox who manages the terrible baseball team the angels and is great throughout the film also fantastic are the young actors joseph gordon-levitt and milton davis jr christopher lloyd is good as al the angel and the effects are great in this top notch disney movie a touching and heart-warming movie which everyone should enjoy
it holds very true to the original manga of the same name aka like us in the but it can still be enjoyed even if you haven't read the manga a different kind of tail showing a strong and independent woman who hurts just like everyone else however because of her outward strength she fears showing her inner feelings and thus those around her hurt her with their blunt comments the only one who truly figures her out and who she can be at ease with is her new if you want something different than the normal boring stuff with some wonderful j-dorama drama then this is definitely the series to read
dr mordrid what can i say jeffrey combs has done it mordrid has been on earth for years waiting for kabal an evil sorcerer to come so he can kill him mordrid and kabal used to train together as kids so mordrid knows all film as a little bit confusing at begin with but soon you feel a part of the action i won't give away the ending so go and watch doctor found the film to be very enjoyable because it doesn't have a lot of violence in nor sexual scenes the film focused on the plot and what i like i find the best films are the ones where times seems to fly by this is because you are so engrossed in the film doctor mordrid is a fantasticly engrossing movie i give it a out of worth
kate beckinsale is as good if not better than gwyneth paltrow as emma in this movie although i really liked gwyneth paltrow in the other emma version they're both good in different ways kate beckinsale as emma seems more interesting almost though and i liked the woman who played harriet smith in this movie better was more believably sweet and sentimental there are certain things i like better about the gwyneth paltrow version though like how the humorous side is more apparent
chances are you'll think this movie is incredibly stupid the first time you watch it but if by chance you watch it a second and third and fourth and fifth time well into the hundreds by now you will find yourself spitting a line from it here and there and cracking yourself up my friends and i have actually thrown fear of a black hat parties to get more of our friends as they say down with the riots
in complete contrast to the opinions of the other review this film actually was surprisingly good i reluctantly went to see it and expected to be bored by clichés obvious jokes and overacting all of which the trailer had after minutes in i found myself genuinely laughing and enjoying the refreshing acting with only one toilet humour gag over her dead body manages to actually come up with realistically funny scenarios and without spoiling anything too much some of the moments involving animals are staple ingredients of a good film are all there script director and actors and compared some other recent attempts at romantic comedy this film stands you aren't going to learn anything or have a spiritual awakening but if you go with an open mind you will more than likely have a good time
this film takes you inside itself in the early minutes and holds you till the end it has a very humane story and very good selected music the acting of moritz bleibtreu amato and barnaby metschurat amato is satisfying recommended to people who get bored of action films and want to see a good movie
absolutely one of my favorite movies of all time i have seen it at least a hundred times and i can't go through it without crying i defy anyone to watch the reunion of celie and nettie or shug and father and not feel your eyes getting misty whoopie goldberg should have one an award for amazing portrayal and for the person who said you can't love the movie if you loved the book wrong im a testament to that
i thoroughly enjoyed this movie but it is nothing here is grouping it with other war movies this movie has been miscategorized its not a war movie any more than one flew over the cuckoos nest is a asylum movie or cool hand luke is a prison movie this is a movie about individuality nonconformity self-confidence and the costs of that personality plot is the same as one flew over the cuckoos nest and cool hand luke its in good company and it holds its own its these movies it should be held up against and compared not apocalypse now or
i first saw this movie as a pre-teen about the age when kids start to think through their identity i was greatly affected by the scene of the man and the children who he raises as his own the eldest boy has been taunted that his mother is a prostitute and none of his siblings have the same biological father kurosawa makes obvious by having children who look nothing like each other the man still persuades tho boy that he is their father by the only definition that counts the man is acclaimed to be father by all of the children but one who still prefers her of the vignettes are likewise compelling for their own stories and a great film even if it is not the greatest kurosawa film
one of the best movies i've seen in the last years seen the premier in tel-aviv israel in the summer of exactly when the last war has began this problem in communication between the people that causes wars is interesting me for a long time and it doesn't matter boys and girls straight and gays jews and arabs i've seen the bubble already times and it still surprising and exciting each character reminds me of one of the many people i know and the difference between them like between tel aviv and jerusalem the last time i saw was with my friend who is a christian arab and it was on the independence day of israel the most symbolic i could how ironic and he cried in the end if been touched and wasn't everyone would be touched by the bubble
youth sexuality and the french countryside one of the more unique films you're ever going to see if you can see it that is no mean feat considering how hard it is to find copies of it combination of scarcity and censorship sometimes erotic sometimes disgusting and occasionally funny a trifle boring also in the middle but all in all you can't call yourself an aficionado of bizarre film until you've seen this one at least once
a good movie maybe i like it because it was filmed here in pr the actors did a good performance and not only did the girls be girlish but they were good in fighting so it was awsome the guy is cute too so a good match if you want to the guy or the girls
this is one of the most guilty pleasure movies am embarrassed to say that my favorite character is tish but still enjoy watching her make her space outfit like super cool with a like totally bitchin belt and stick on rhinestones on her anyways the movie is actually one of the few family movies that holds your interest i know that the begining drags particuarly if you know what is going to happen but the second half is probably one of the most nerve wracking segments in a family wouldn't stand up in front of millions of people and proclaim to love this movie in fact renting it is pretty embarrassing itself but i'll admit it here with the internet to hide
i have rarely emerged from viewing a film with such a warm happy feeling i felt as if i had been out with really good friends and had a wonderful time i thoroughly enjoyed this film the acting was superb although i would have to mention bill nye in particular as giving an absolutely faultless performance bill is an excellent actor and would love to see him in more films timothy spall and jimmy nail are also favourites and always love to see them as they give such a solid performance and billy connolly as always totally gorgeous it was a wonderful ensemble performance from all concerned such a refreshing experience to see a well-written superbly acted and good-looking movie
just after i saw the movie the true magic feeling of the walt disney movies came up in me and i realized me that it was a long time ago that i saw the real magic in a combination of the right music speeches and magical effects brings the disney feeling again into your body very special things i saw where the not-knowing effects in the movie started with the disney logo transforming into the cinderella castle and ended as an old-story telling fairytale with your magic has returned in me i rate this movie out of
a simple can i say this is a wonderful film that i can watch over and over it is definitely one of the top ten comedies made with a great cast jack lemmon and walter matthau wording a perfect script by neil simon based on his is real to life situation done perfectly if you have digital cable one gets the menu on bottom of screen to give what is on it usually gives this film stars but in reality it deserves stars if you really watch this film one can tell that it will be as funny and fresh a hundred years from now
wow what a wonderful film the script is nearly perfect it appears this is the only film written by minglun hope he has more stories in acting is sublime renying zhou as doggie was amazing very natural talent and xu zhu was a delight very believable as the jaded old traditionalist soundtrack was very effective guiding without being overwhelming only more movies like this were made whether in hollywood or hong a family friendly well acted well written well directed near perfect gem
sequels hardly ever live up to the original this definitely proves true in this case however if you're a big fan of the original than definitely give this a watch although the camera work is lacking brian character is annoying and the plot is clique much more funnier than the first and that is what i find entertaining about it see this movie expecting the same performance as in the first film quite frankly a bit different rather than sitting in his cabin writing screenplays stanley is off in hollywood trying to direct his dream project cabin by the lake this movie has a much different feel but still great to see stanley back in giving it a out of
really i liked it the premise was good the story fit where both respective series left off and my favorite part mary and valerie aren't bitter they aren't like others who become synonymous with a certain series and then refuse to talk about it or do possible reunions prime example is susan dey the partridge family in fact valerie was saying that she'd be thrilled to do another movie and then mary said the same thing later so i would be on the look for if that doesn't quite work out then they can re-run this one
it was simple and yet so nice i think the whole sense of sex segregation in society which can be bitter was shown very delicately it had a bitter kind of hummer in it the fact that most of the actors were not professionals made the movie more tangible and more realistic there was a documentary side to the movie too the best scenes were those that all the girls banned from watching were listening passionately to the soldier who is supposed to keep an eye on them broadcasting the game if you are an iranian the familiar cheering and dancing in the streets after a game won fills you up with national pride if you are not iranian you'll still love it all the same
this is a great film esp when compared with the sometimes wearisome earnestness of politically-minded filmmakers a film that can so easily combine sex gender relations politics and art is a rarity these days while the bouyant optimism of the can't be regained i think we can at least learn a lesson from the breezy energy and charm i don't know what those who label the film boring were watching so much packed into it that it never remains the same film for more that min at a time
i don't know why people always want deeper meaning in movies or else consider them about just being entertained something at which morgan freeman excels he gets a chance to show off a bit paz vega his co-star gets a career boost and brad silberling gets a name to draw people into watching his thought it was a good movie some humor some pathos some bittersweetness but nothing over the top i got an especial kick out of jim parsons as the receptionist at a construction company when he looks at freeman adoringly and says you make me want to be a woman just hilarious the fight scene between ms vega her ex-husband and his girlfriend is wonderful short a cute charming film that will make you smile you could do much much worse
this is a well-made documentary on the exciting world of indy car racing the photography is simply outstanding the scene were mario andretti drives the old racing roadster down the new england street lined with the ancient maples leaves blown to the side by the speed of the car is incredible the film does lose some of its beauty on the small screen but if you like watching cars driven to their limit you should see this film
tigerland is one of the finest films that i have seen and in my opinion it outdoes even full metal jacket a film of similar nature bozz is played exceptionally well by farrell and is a character who stays in your mind long after the film ends the ending is brilliantly cut by schumacher with the melodic harmony singing and the slow mo of the troops preparing to leave what a film
on first watching this film it is hard to know quite what has happened but on a subsequent viewing it become more clear i enjoyed this movie dean cain was excellent in the role of bob lexa character was confusing to understand at first she was out to trap bob but i really believe she landed up loving him although by then she had broken his heart dean performance was an usual excellent he gets better with every film he does my only question at the end of the film was what happened to bob camilla and the baby it was left for the viewer to decide
this show is a great history story has everything from way they were treated religion the ways jews were sent into inquisition the belief in the orisha the african gods the way women were the daughters even down to homosexuality the way the characters are intertwined and that violante that character saddens me she is so desperate to be loved that she destroys everyone around am so glad they decided to re-release it to again although i would love to see the unedited version xica has become my heroine i look up to the way she uses her power to help all who seek it i love all the characters and have found that they can relate to many people now in this century i look forward to my xica every night it would be great to dub it in english so the americans can love her too
i first saw enchanted april about five years ago i loved it so much that my husband surprised me with a copy the following christmas about two women who decide to rent a castle in italy for the month of april leaving their humdrum lives behind them they are very sad women at the outset of the film and you can't help but root them on as they plan this get-away with two other women they invite along to share the expenses this is perhaps the most feel good movie i have ever seen it pure and simple with no car chases no animosities and no deaths it was made with care and in very good taste you cannot help but smile all through it except when you're crying happy tears
this was one of the first creepy movies i ever was about at the time it scared me good but that night i put chewing gum in one eye to be like the my mom got very upset she had to clean my eye with alcohol and the next day my eye smelled like double mint now a movie hey for time it was a great movie that head sitting on the lab counter top was as real as it got back then and if your it is very scary kids now a days are spoiled by special effects that show too much and leave nothing for your minds imagination your mind can imagine things more scarier than special effects
robert wuhl is teaching a class of film students at new york university in manhattan new covers fallacies of history and truths that are no longer generally known i would like to see much more of this show it is very entertaining mr wuhl uses examples and show and tell to get his points across he explained that the person who actually rode the midnight ride of paul revere was not paul revere henry wadsworth longfellow used name because it sounded watched robert wuhl for many years from the time he was doing stand-up comedy and all the way through on hbo a good actor and a good stand-up comedian but an excellent teacher i highly recommend that you watch an episode of this show it is well worth your time
this is the best of shelley high-quality faerie tale theatre series the ugly stepsisters are broadway-quality comedy relief and eve arden is the personification of wicked stepmotherhood jennifer beals does an excellent job as a straight cinderella especially in the garden scene with matthew prince charming jean stapleton plays the fairy godmother well although i'm not sure i liked the southern lady characterization with some of the lines steve comedy relief as the royal orchestra conductor is quintessential martin but a tiny bit misplaced in the is customary with the series there are several wry comments thrown in for the older children and up with a couple of small bumps the show flows well and they live happily ever after children up to age will continue to watch it after the parents finally get tired of it i found times in one day to be a little too much
the thing i remember most about this film is that it used to air on local ktla tv during every christmas season during the mid to late mainly due to the fact that the true story took place on or near christmas eve it was always a bit disturbing to see the hell that this girl goes through being the lone survivor of a plane crash in the peruvian jungle the graphic scene of this young girl pulling leeches out of her infected leg made quite an impression on this young viewer not quite the kind of christmas cheer i was used to seeing at the time definitely not a rankin-bass production
brilliant over-acting by lesley ann warren best dramatic hobo lady i have ever seen and love scenes in clothes warehouse are second to none the corn on face is a classic as good as anything in blazing saddles the take on lawyers is also superb after being accused of being a turncoat selling out his boss and being dishonest the lawyer of pepto bolt shrugs indifferently i'm a lawyer he says three funny words jeffrey tambor a favorite from the later larry sanders show is fantastic here too as a mad millionaire who wants to crush the ghetto his character is more malevolent than usual the hospital scene and the scene where the homeless invade a demolition site are all-time classics look for the legs scene and the two big diggers fighting bleeds this movie gets better each time i see it is quite often
i'm giving it only out of because i need to view it again in a more current mind-frame to have a fresh perspective what i remember is an amazing psychological thriller that dazzled my brain and my eyes when i watched it i would watch it every time it came on hbo back in the day or so i might have even recorded it but that recording is long gone i'm wrote to greencine to try and get this title in they currently don't carry it i hope i can find it at a local video would highly recommend giving it a try if you find it somewhere interesting at the very least if you enjoyed movies such as edward scissorhands beetlejuice gummo or anything sort of strange and along those lines try this one out
wasn't sure what to think of the movie not too much of a kids film definately should be watched with a parent because it includes death and dying but i was surprised that i was a bit entertained by was a bit disappointed by the minutes of time we had less without the credits and the trailer gets you to think the rodent is a main creature but alas they torture him right until the end of the movie those two gripes docked the movie stars but i do recommend the movie even for a entertainment
this episode introduced the holodeck to the tng world the jarada have to be contacted and a precise greeting must be delivered or it would greatly insult them a tired picard decides to take a trip into the holodeck and a wonderful adventure begins the settings are superb and almost movie like alas the jarada probe sent shortly thereafter damages the holodeck and all safety devices stop working picard and now guests must outwit the mobsters of gangland america and return to the jarada rendezvous picard greets the jarada correctly and a new day dawns between humanity and the jarada this gem of a first season episode set the holodeck for many interesting and unusual adventures to be had there
this is possibly the best short crime drama i've ever seen the acting is superb especially amanda burton character goes from scary to sweet to disturbing to sad and then does an amazing job balancing feelings and acting out the pain of someone lost a child its so believable that it feels more like a real life story then a drama the other actors are of course great too which they usually are in british the i'm not going to give fantastic mainly because you don't really get one get what i mean after you've seen it this is well worth buying and seeing over and over again and if you're not touched by this you're one cold hearted person
mary poppins is definitely much better but this is a lovely film nonetheless angela lansbury is splendidly dotty as engletine price and david tomlinson has great fun as mr brown their chemistry was just brilliant as well the children however just lacked the same sparkle though paul is very funny and cute the songs were actually not as bad as some people say beautiful briny sea is the best in fact all the songs are outstanding the special effects were wonderful that had plenty of magic and the story is original enough the highlights though like mary poppins were the animated sequences the underwater sequence was beautiful but my favourite was the football match which was absolutely hilarious the only other criticism was that i didn't quite get the ending when i first saw it all in all a lovely film that is hardly ever on bethany cox
an inexhaustible hunger for basic training movies so surprising that this one got so little notice when first released looks likely to have a well-deserved second life on isn't uniformly great by any means there are some terribly cliched characters the portrayal of the makes you long for the return of lee full metal jacket ermey but the lead performance of colin farrell is the stuff of instant stardom charisma to burn and a role any actor would kill to get
vignettes were insightful and quite enjoyable it was curious seeing so many soon to be famous actors when they were very young the performances and attention to detail were wonderful to in film it isn't necessary that source material be in alignment with the contemporary era to be interesting or worthwhile small morality storytelling is quaint coy only in the eye of the story overcome time subject or there are quite a few contemporary films today that have not overcome the conventions or cutting edge mores of the present era inserting small morality provide a dimension lacking
i enjoyed this film it was funny cute silly and entertaining had a fine cast and really got hammered by some critics for reasons that i truly don't understand no it wasn't the grapes of wrath or casablanca or even moonstruck but it was an enjoyable was excellent playing the psychotic man behind the man the story is a little silly to be sure but it this isn't high drama folks i happened to see a review of the film probably the only good one it got and then ran into it one night when looking for a movie i never heard it was supposed to stink until after i saw it and i'm glad i saw it eventually bought the vhs tape on the bargain pile and i watch it a couple times a year
no hidden agenda pure scifi all saw the original on tv and was scared pretty bad i was a kid original one can be appreciated more when compared to the new one which i saw and have forgotten the original one starring the great movie star steve mcqueen is by far the better and only version anyone should movie production is dated but the fx used to make the blob stands up the test of time i was convinced that that thing was moving on its own accord
i first encountered this show when i was staying in japan for six months last year i found it in the internet when i was looking for sub-titled dramas to help me with my japanese my host mother warned me to stay away from it because she thought it was weird but i found it delightful koyuki showed such conflicting character traits and spirit made my day every time i tuned in i first saw him on hana yori dango but i liked him much better in the characters are interesting and well-developed i was disappointed to find that they didn't change very much throughout the show their relationship grew but they didn't really still a fun time had by all for fukushima
i first saw this film around ten years ago and i thought it was very funny indeed it was not as bad as some critics were making it out to be the fact that it was written by the usually dependable john hughes shows that you can at least expect some funny dialogue the way i also think weird science is quite good which was also penned in lightning speed by film has a very garish look to it using all the primary colours reds yellows etc which makes it look quite unique the cast are also quite good the prudish bunny packard and the devil-possessed delores salk are a stand film has certainly dated a little but i personally prefer it to all the other lampoon series
i first saw this movie at the sundance film festival this year and being a teenager myself i found the movie to be quite appealing these kids are out of the ordinary and very unexpected to be in a movie of this stature but with the right dialog and junk they made the movie a complete success i enjoyed this movie more then others but i highly recommend releasing and watching this movie it is a mixture of witty comments and hilarious reality capturing the essence of high school high school record has topped my favorites list and hopefully has a chance to be released into theaters i truly thank all of the kids who put the hard work into making this film it helped me cry my eyes our in laughter
i really liked this movie i saw the original classic a few times but could hardly remember any details i think this movie is much better than the cartoon its not so black and white as it i specially liked how they made the grinch such a complete character and gave a cause of why he was the way he was the villain in this movie was not the actual grinch but the major much different than the original cartoon jim carrey was perfect for the part all in all a great movie made for both kids and adults alike
oh dear we don't like it when our super-hero love interest develops a brain do has happened to people they have lost the ability to enjoy a simple feel-good love kirsten dunst is a revelation funny sexy and real i laughed out loud ooh at least five times and i'm not ashamed to say had a tear in my eye a couple of times too the cast acting and script is great i watch a lot of films right across the board and i haven't seen one in this genre that has been as successful those who disagree please tell me where i can find some i'm sure the book is good too but i think you have to judge it on its own merits
overall i found this movie quite amusing and fun to watch with plenty of laugh out loud moments this movie is not for everyone that is why i created this quick question-ere if you answer yes to any of the following questions than i recommend watching this you enjoy crude sexual humor you enjoy alcohol related humor you enjoy amazingly hot girls you enjoy viewing boobs you enjoy viewing multiple boobs i mention all the nice boobies in this you noticed the spoiler alert that is referring the mass amount of nudity you can expect in the movie i myself have no idea what the plot was about not that it matters
a truly adorable heroine who at turns is surprised and terrified by giblets wrestles with mattresses runs full-on into closed doors just a few of the moments that sparkle in my memory of the naked truth i loved what i caught of this show enjoyably daft plots and some good supporting characters provided the setting for the diamond of the show tea leoni as nora wilde cute clownish and wonderfully accident-prone how refreshing to see an actress who can clown no wonder hollyood doesn't seem to know how to cast her but where-oh-where are the dvd releases the amount of they release incredible me that this little gem continues to remain buried please correct me if i'm wrong
the best martial arts movie ever made this one movie is better than anything bruce lee ever did a classic with a thoroughly entertaining and brutal climax jackie chan is the king of martial arts movies and the true king of kung a great pity that whilst bruce lee had been so overrated it took jackie chan an eternity to become popular in europe and america jackie rules
a bugs life is a great film that is not just for kids but for adults too the story is set around a colony of ants and their struggle against the evil grasshoppers who come back every year and steal their food a mirror of the magnifiscent seven there is some wonderfull computer animation and the voices are great too you will love it out of
a really cool flick a must for any music snob you don't really have to know about the bands to enjoy the movie before the movie i only heard only two songs from the dandy warhols the only thing is required is an open mind movie centers around the brian jonestown massacre the dandy warhols have a role in the film as the rival band but they are second fiddle to the bjm the dandy warhols don't play as big of a role in the film as i originally guessed but then again they didn't have the element of excitement and unpredictability of the can't help but be fascinated by the band and its very charismatic front man anton newcombe by itself an insightful film and study on the music industry just watch this film and enjoy
i have seen this film only once on tv and it has not been repeated this is strange when you consider the rubbish that is repeated over and over again usually horror movies for me are a source of amusement but this one really scared not read the next bit if you have'nt seen the film scariest bit is when the townsfolk pursue the preacher to where his wife lies almost dead been poisoning her he asks who the hell are you people anyway one by one they give their true identities the girl who was pretending to be deaf in order to corrupt and seduce him says i am lilith the witch who loved adam before eve
contrary to most reviews i've read i didn't feel this followed any of the other rock movies tap etc the story was more unique although i feel most people wanted to see the sex drugs rock and roll vices that the band kept alluding as an american i knew a few of the actors spall connelly rea surprised to find out robinson was in classic romeo juliet guess i'll have to rent that the flame still burns my wife who hails from mexico didn't follow the language too well missed some of the jokes i dutifully explained but she cried her eyes out at the concert scene she loves the song so much funny that has the soundtrack for when i bought the dvd in the bargain bin at wal-mart for price non-withstanding i first saw this on late night cable and have been dying to find it ever since
the three main characters are very well portrayed especially anisio by rock musician turned into first time actor paulo miklos he is extremely convincing as the lower class the film shows very well the snowball effect of getting involved in ever more shady business the contrast and similarities between the lower and higher classes how everyone gets carried away by greed and ambition out of
level one i saw this film for the first time at i knew it would give me nightmares it did surprisingly as i recall it was the sound as much as the sight of the monster that caused two psychoanalytic as an adult i saw the story for what it was what if the savage unrestrained instincts we all repress became three pure science best way plausibly to realize the what if is through the science fiction genre this is pure science fiction not the cowboys in space that passes for the genre years forbidden planet remains the greatest of all science fiction films if planning a remake skg or lucas watch out
made by french brothers jules and giddeon naudet and narrated by robert de niro and firefighter james hanlon this is a compelling and heartbreaking tale of how new finest shone on darkest day i first saw this when i was a young naive year old and at that age it still touched me knowing how serious really was seeing this expanded the whole effect of we were finding out who the heroes were how there everyday lives were composed and how they put their lives on the line in a situation where most people would just run and save their selves these brave men put their lives on the line and watching this just increases my admiration for them watch if you is the best documentary i have personally ever seen
debut is easily one of the most enjoyable indie films that i've watched in the past year making it hard to believe that cross eyed is the debut film i logged onto imdb to find more films by this cross eyed has that unique signature want to see what else this writer might have to say these days its rare to see a movie that is well-written well-directed well-edited and well-acted for eyed encapsulates what movie making should be the best of all film elements to create a clever artistic and poignant tale more please
atlantis the lost empire is a better movie than i thought i never thought this movie would lead to my expectations true this movie started slow but as the movie wore on it became more to my liking the story takes place in and is about a guy named milo milo believes in the fabled atlantis along with friends of his grandfather he embarks on an amazing adventure of his own along the way he must endear friendship betrayal trust and more the voice cast is great they surely know how to carry movies with only their voice talent the music is nothing special but likable anyway the animation is not the best but it is still good enough overall this is a good family movie for all ages i rate this movie
holes is my all-time favorite movie so far i have seen this movie three times in theaters and am looking forward to purchasing it on dvd this upcoming september i read the book after seeing the movie and was amazed at how alike the book and movie were the director of this film did an excellent job of re-creating the book into movie form also all of the actors selected to play the roles did wonderful playing their characters especially max kasch as zigzag props to all those involved in making this movie it was a real success out of stars i definitely recommend it for everyone to see
i saw it at cinema hautefeuille just one night after its first public projection in paris a very pretty film about three years old teenagers all of them just at about the same psychologically stages many of the scenes let us to come back to our adolescence age our first feelings about sexual relations it is possible to imagine that the director would like to reduce the first strong sensual feelings of the girls to lesbianism but even in that case she doesn't corrupt the likelihood of the story you can sometimes find the film a little slow but it is what creates this intimate atmosphere i fund the young actresses of talent special mention with floriane and marie very convincing there are many small details but this film also enabled me to discover what synchronized swimming is impressing
this movie is the first of the six infamous guinea pig movies and is one of the best at the same time it looks realistic and unrealistic just knowing that the movie is fake the story is about a woman who got captured and is tortured in a lot of different ways a man in the beginning of the story receives a letter without a return address and it includes a manga video showing the torture the men who capture her are testing the limits of a human before they die some scenes are shocking such as the eyeball scene and others are not shocking like the girl being punched times because you see punches in nearly every movie this movie has a lot of gore so i would recommend this to people or
in watching this early demille work it was once again reinforced to me that early demille is far superior to late demille his attention to use of light within scenes is remarkable his pacing is very good enabling much to be told in the space of an hour or so it is a pity that he wasn't as intuitive about the style of his later sound films as he seemed to be in his silent was the first film in which i had seen cleo ridgely she was remarkable quite restrained and yet conveyed a broad spectrum of ending is wonderful
to be honest i didn't like that much this movie when i saw it for the first time but i guess the trouble is that i haven't seen it in a theater big mistake because the thing to see in cliffhanger is the settings and is the cinematography try to see this movie on the largest tv possible and a great sound system the music is good and puts the movie to a higher level a commercial potential the more i see it the more i like definitely one of renny best movie this guy knows about action die hard the long kiss good bye etc and particularly good in this movie the special effect are great and spectacular stallone really needed that movie get back with success still good to see him
jazz aficionados will treasure this classic short showing some of the best men of jazz just doing their thing like watching a no frills music video jazz men give us an additional treat in the person of marie bryant who sings a classic version of on the sunny side of the street i had never heard her sing before bryant sounds remarkably like billie holliday a compliment instrumental work is tops as well with the black cinema of its time fed a lot of white stereotypes this film is to be watched and treasured no great production values just a lot of good music
another entry in the holiday horror category that fills the shelves of your local video store the wronged nerdy teen taking revenge on the cool kids who wronged him plot will of course be familiar to those who've watched it before and those who've seen it before will probably watch it again those who are expecting ingmar bergman and will subsequently become indignant about their wasted time should just skip it marilyn manson on the soundtrack and david boreanaz denise richards and katherine heigl as eye with the flow and enjoy it oh and i loved the creepy mask
i watched this last night after not having seen it for several years it really is a fun little film with a bunch of faces you didn't know were in it arkin shines as always check it out you won't be dissappointed by the way it was just released on dvd and contrary to its packaging it is widescreen the transfer is rather poor but at least the whole movie is visible
very good dramatic comedy about a playwright trying to figure out how to keep his head above water after running out of ideas can't say much about this film without giving away the story i can say that little was as it seems as you are watching the picture everybody has his or her own agenda nice little surprise at the end after all the other surprises well written with good performances by all
an enthralling wonderful look at the films that inspired the excellent martin scorsese many of the films he speaks of are easy to relate to his works particularly the earlier ones the silent era very enjoyable despite being a bit long i found this to be one of the best documentaries on film yet required viewing if you admire martin scorsese and his work
i agree with what veinbreaker wrote with regards to the ahhhh feeling you get at the end of this movie i absolutely loved the locations they chose to film the songs were well written and interesting especially the psychedelic sounding track on which hans matheson sings trippy nighy was fab in his role nail nailed it beano was the typical drummer and rea kept it together bruce robinson was awesome helena was a lovely girlfriend but i felt juliet performance was gorgeous the scenes between aubrey robinson killed me perfectly played and the music behind the scene was spot on too bad not many more musicians have checked this movie out they ought told all my musician friends great quote by jimmy character supposed to be rock roll not the phantom of the opera
the performance of every actor and actress the film are excellently natural which is what movie acting should be and the directing skill is so brilliantly handled on every details that i am never tired of seeing it over and over again however i am rather surprised to see that this film is not included in some of the actors and director credits that puzzles me aren't they proud of making a claim that they have made such excellent long lasting film for the audience i am hoping i would get some answers to my puzzles from some one one of the knowledgeable personnel of the film
i liked antz but loved a life the animation that was put into this paid off i will definitely be getting this on dvd by the way disney should make a widescreen version of this movie on tape heard talk of squishing all of the characters into the screen on the standard video format most will have to agree that the ending credits were the funniest i only saw one of the two sets but i can't wat to see the other one
low budget one of earliest films but it is maybe his funniest john candy was not so far removed from his sctv days in going berserk and it shows if you don't crack up when candy tries to help a guy with his groceries while being hand-cuffed to an escaped cohort in the process of having sex with his girlfriend with only the apartment door separating them see the movie or the way euguene levy creator of kong fu yu is talking to his mom on the phone or just the countless number of facial expressions that only candy could deliver you better check your pulse if you like the john candy of only the lonely this is may not be a movie i would advise you to see but if you enjoy the sctv days of john candy this movie is a must see
i love to watch this movie a lot because of all the scary scenes about the raptors i like raptors because they are scary my favorite parts are the ones where the raptor looks behind the pillar because it reminds me of a scene from the friday the movie with the girl who eats the really love to watch a lot of this movie because the computer graphics seem a little fake but okay because once you get into the movie you hardly even notice what is going on and i think got a good ending even though i didn't really understand what was going on on my first couple viewings i figured it out over time and the important part the other important part is how scary the dinosaurs can be if you're watching it the first is best movie
a delightful piece of cinema storytelling in a simple but effective way cinema after all is a visual media and igor used its full potential a young restless man boards a train with no destination in mind in one of the compartments he meets with a girl words are not exchanged but their laundry washing are and from there we are taken on a ride with other peculiar characters and situations the two leads are perfectly cast as their unique features tell you a story that needs no words
i was worried that my daughter might get the wrong idea i think the dark-heart character is a little on the rough side and i don't like the way he shape-shifts into a mean frog fox boy i was wrong this movie was made for my kid not for me she gets it when it went over my head of course i don't get it this isn't one of the new kids movies that adults will also enjoy this is straight for the young ones and the crew knew what they were doing there isn't any political junk ether no magic key that will save the world from ourselves nobody has the right to access excess and everyone isn't happy all the time and as a side benefit nobody dies
the movie was actually a romantic drama based on three sisters who had desires to become a famous girl group in their endeavors the oldest sister meets a drug dealer and street hustler called satin whom sister goes after because she believes he is the big time who will give her everything she ever thought she wanted out of life though he could be accused of killing her he really kills only her spirit and will to live after which she becomes a drug addict and ultimately dies from an overdose the story isn't about the street life or the italian mobster who tries to buy stix off then threatens him about how love can overcome even the worst tragedies in life as portrayed in song and style and the character that was the life in the times for young women trying to be discovered back then
this is a gory mess and pretty convincing corbin bernson is very much in command of this movie with his slick portrayal of the loony control freak eponymous practitioner linda hoffman plays his cheating wife and she is very easy on the eye unfortunately for her the little tryst with the pool guy brings severe punishment in a way the good doctor knows best shame about that pretty smile the last half hour of the movie is devoted to character losing it completely and the spotlight falls on a young actress called virginya keehne an extremely talented performer she hogs the limelight from the moment the braces come off nice legs too
orson welles the lady from shanghai does not have the brilliant screenplay of citizen kane but charles lawton cinematography the unforgettable set pieces as the scene in the aquarium the seagoing scene featuring a stunning blonde-tressed rita hayworth singing please don't love me and the truly amazing hall of mirrors climax and the wonderful cast sloane in his greatest performance welles in a beautifully under-played role the afore-mentioned miss wife at the her most gorgeous make for a very memorable filmgoing experience the bizarre murder mystery plot is fun and compelling not inscrutable at all the viewer is surprised by the twists and turns and welles closing line is an unheralded classic the lady from shanghai gets four stars from this impartial arbiter
this is far more than the charming story of middle-aged man discovering the pleasures of ballroom dancing it is that as well the tale of one person learning to love life again pushing past all the pressures of work and money to discover joy once more the bonus in this film is a fascinating insight into the slowly changing attitudes of modern japan toward everything from ballroom dancing to physical contact there are scenes that will make you laugh out loud a few where you'll want to get up and tango and many others where you'll just feel is a great introduction to contemporary japanese filmmaking for those who might be under the impression that all japanese movies are heavy and inaccessible
this film is excellently paced you never have to wait for a belly laugh to come up for more than about a minute and much more going on than the initial premise of the film throughout it there are mockeries of the traditional schmaltzy local-boys-done-good-overcoming-adversity genre of which this parodies don't let anyone tell you that they're trying to get cheap laughs just by using sure plenty of that but all contextual not gratuitous i loved this film and it only cost me on dvd so in terms of entertainment value for money it has been the best film i've seen this year
the combination of the superb black and white photography and the eugene onegin with a twist plot made this a real knock out for me the atmosphere created by the mostly very dark shots contrasted with occasional very bright overexposed white was gripping there was a superb moment where where transparencies apparently conventional holiday snaps but where the faces of the actors revealed character and situation subtly but instantly were shown accompanied by heart-wrenching aria from the tschaikowsky opera eugene me the mark of a good film is that it should take advantage of the opportunities presented by that medium which means that often the story is less important than imagery and atmosphere last year in marienbad is a good example of such a film krisana is in the same mould
this movie had a great ensemble of adult actors along with a cast of youthful actors that are going to be in movies for a long while if there is any justice the directing and editing was great i may look up the book that this was adapted from it must have been great liked it sigourney weaver jon voight and tim blake nelson were a blast to watch henry winkler and nathan davis were not seen enough but were fun when they were onscreen the kids at the camp couldn't have been better i said i liked it
this is the start of a new and interesting star trek series it has a down to of feel with darker and less plaggy characters need some more time to develop but they have potential one thing that is fairly disappointing all star trek series really is that they portray such a gloomy picture of the equality between men and women in the future when they paint a very positive picture about everything else has stopped war famine the female characters here are two subcommander t'pol who is vulcan and communications officer hoshi who is human hoshi is quite wimpy and t'pol is made to be a vulcan some of the crew attitudes feel a bit too american opposed to the more international feel of the tng-crew but creates interesting a very good pilot though for a very good series

the story is being told fluidly there are no interruptions the flash backs are woven into the present seamlessly casting was superb young ya'ara looked very much like ya'ara would have looked at that age her portrayal of a blind person was done convincingly director daniel syrkin have done a superb job in getting the various actors to work together in this story the cinematography is very good you feel like you are with ya'ara and talia walking toward the ocean to the edge of the cliff the english subtitles follow the hebrew script very closely it is interesting to note that even though out of sight is not a direct translation of lemarit ayin both names are very appropriate to the story
i saw this movie after i saw blue crush and other of movies i thought she had a bleak future in this was extremely wrong after watching her performance in girlfight i was amazed in the way she captures the emotion of one a fighter but also a this movie the way she confronts her father about the treatment of her and her brother the way she conveys anger when getting characters learning curve in the movie of she cant always put up a wall and hide from love or that just because she has power she wont believe this role was fit perfectly for michelle even though she had no prior experience the director saw talent i criticize myself for not seeing the talent in her
yeah the archetype of a simple but inspirational movie the very end when the entire crowd in the stadium gets up and the people raise their hands gives me a chill whenever i see it just brilliant joseph is wonderful as the lonely and sad kid who has so far been disappointed by anyone and anything in his life the way he interacts with danny glover and tries to make him believe in the magic and the angels is funny and exhilarating a very nice family movie with i concede a rather corny happy end but hey it doesn't really matter the movie retains its basic quality by the good acting and the inspirational themes
tintin was one of my favorite heroes as a kid i used to borrow the books from the school library every chance i got my favorite one was the red sea sharks so much action and documentary was a brilliant exposition of the background story of herge and his development of tintin the personal experience in interviewing herge and the story of his relationship with the artist who was the inspiration for the chan character was very great documentary of a very talented and well-loved artist a great example of someone who has become internationally renown and has brought joy of millions of children the young at heart all over the world
this movie is not porn it was not meant to be porn and unless my uncle runs for president of the world it should never be considered that that issue was sorted out i can say i thoroughly recommend this film as issues are still widely available funny the acting is great and it raises can't fully understand why this film was so mistreated probably this is why i plan to never visit the us lena is the true pioneer of the modern riot-grrrl movement confusion curiosity and wit are her main attributes she is occasionally angry but aren't we all
the mother tells of a recently widowed mother of two adult children who on the heels of her death finds herself awakening from a life of sleepwalking as she has an affair with a young carpenter who is also her married lover the film dwells on the quietly passive mom her tenuous relationship with her grown son and daughter the silent needs she attempts to soothe in bed with her young lover and the convolutions arising therefrom a somewhat antiseptic drama with rumbling psychodramatic undercurrents the mother does an excellent job of dealing with uncomfortable issues realistically while avoiding gratuitous sensationalism will play best with more mature audiences possibly women who may better empathize with the central character her needs and issues
wells story the shape of things to come was made into a movie in well made science fiction tale about a war that lasts for cast and old lace sir cedric of bandits and margaretta glimpses of rocket futuristic film was ahead of its by william cameron from very enjoyable much like the earlier movie avoid the so called sequel the shape of things to was made in this movie has nothing to do with the wells like jules verne had a vision for the future with his classic science fiction out of
this is the first michael vartan movie i've seen-i haven't seen and i was curious to see if the guy can sure can and is likable in this henstridge is of course gorgeous but she is usually in more physical and action i found her very good and lovable in this role of a schoolteacher some of the negative comments i read are movie is full of clichés and the story doesn't ring true at though every character in the movie remarks how good they look don't think there is screen chemistry there enjoyed this locales are characters are likable and goodlooking and the supporting actors are pretty good if you are expecting to see a great is not if you want to see a pleasant innocent goodlooking movie with likable characters its very good
my father grew grew up watching george reeves as superman and when i was a little kid he had episodes on vhs and let me view them including this movie them down in the family if you will and i loved kent and lois lane get sent to a small town with and oil mine and from the mine emerge mole men radioactive and targeted by the town assumed to be deadly and up to superman to stop this just so wonderful and fun to view the old style special effects and sound the crew pulled off such a beauty with such little technology george reeves was my hero when i was a little kid and i'm now it just goes to show how timeless and classic these adventures are
earth big screen adaptation of the channel series planet earth offers quite a majestic sampling of nature in all its beauty with some truly jaw-dropping moments of how the hell did they get this footage while taking in the awesome scenics of animals in their natural habitats and environmental message of the circle of life can be cruel a great white shark gulping down a walrus seal as a quick meal and adorable various babies and their rents the basso profundo tones of narrator james earl jones solidifies its eye views and profundity culled from literally hundreds of hours of footage the only gripe comes from the fact this should have been in the imax format and could've even gone longer oh well always the next time disney studios has produced this count on a series of more to come dirs alastair fothergill mark linfield
this is a unique and bold film energetic with highly developed characters very good performances love directors who are not afraid to ask the audience to think carr dares to look inward ask questions and dig underneath the surface by the nature of the film it practically demands that the viewer look inward as well it can take some courage to do this i can see how some close-minded people might find this quite disturbing however i found it thought-provoking much more than just carr is truly an original filmmaker with vision i am curious to see what he will do him
tillman drama about the first african american navy master diver jr who defies all odds and achieves his goals despite a strict embittered trainer the screenplay is not bad a bit extreme at times but the direction and acting is first-rate and this film is inspiring and achieves what its supposed to do i liked deniro in the lead although its not on par with his masterful works driver godfather and all the others it is as good as his other good performances such as in king of comedy or angel heart deniro is always convincing and believable here very good performance gooding jr is not bad definitely one of his better performances imdb rating my rating
despite having different directors this fantasy hangs together remarkably was filmed in england near morocco in studios and on a few beaches at the outbreak of war everything was moved to america and some scenes were filmed in the grand for having one of the corniest lyrics in a song i want to be a bandit can't you understand it it remains a favourite of many people
xiao chen zhi chun is a great movie not only in the year it was shot but also now an art movie which is not outdated even in century the director maintained a good narrative skill and thus made the story so movie reminds me of the later french new wave movie francois femme d'a cote which is of the similar topic
i stumbled across rerun syndication of this show several years ago and fell in love with it it features téa leoni and holland taylor and kept me laughing one episode after the next i guess it didn't make it so big and was cancelled after a few seasons but i believe it was a good run and would suggest watching the opportunity arises
a very good adaptation of the novel by amrita pritam urmila and manoj bajpai have given their is a natural flair in the movie and i felt it right through it looked like bollywood finally gave away glamor and had some quality artists performing on wise the movie depicted very much what exactly happened during partition by showing the sufferings of a particular family and also shows that trust in life goes beyond best part was they did not make it a drama with a lot of tear shedding and simply loved it
cinematically this film stinks so does a lot of the acting but care if there is a strong representation of what the a lot of us in the innercity anyways and what hip-hop and break dancing were really music it almost seems like a documentary of a time now hip-hop was a way of life also interesting to see looking like ground zero from a nuclear attack some be too young to remember that it was a poor run down the and this is the best of all the movies that came out around that period of course are considered a joke now with all the bad tv shows but those of us who lived through it will always fondly for a time when music dancing and graffiti were fresh yo
in my opinion this is the best stand-up show i have ever seen i became an instant eddie fan after seeing dress to kill but i must say i think this is his best work i would say though if you ever get the chance to definitely go see him live it is worth of the time after seeing a stand-up routine a couple times the jokes start to get old but i have to say i've seen this show so many times that i literally have the entire thing memorized yes i realize is kinda sad but every joke still makes me laugh this is truly a feel good to kill will never get old for me i own it and watch it anytime i need a good laugh
in an era of such awful cartoons i am rather in shock to see a movie with such good morals make it to the imdb bottom list for animated movie does contradict the first i won't deny that however when i was in the target age group for this movie i didn't even notice nor would it have mattered if i did the people who made it may have used new generation to note that this is another way the care bear family could have began perhaps we are meant to decide for ourselves how the care bear family truly was my favorite movie at age and it did not scare me or confuse me at
a true dark noir movie and a very graphic film nice storyline of a man pursuing redemption that may have just left it all too late visually there are some really nice scenes artistically amazing as to what can be done with a minimal budget full marks to gareth maxwell roberts and team i look forward to the next project with new ideas although hopefully more british actors would be great lisa ray looked lovely not seen her before and hope to see her again in the future subject all interesting and violence bring it on i would definitely say to rent this one and check it out if you're in the mood for a semi moody noir
a must see i saw whipped at a press screening and it was hilarious we're talking nonstop laughs it makes something about mary seem like a meandering drama amanda peet screams star quality with her winning combination of beauty brains and serious acting ability peter cohen the director has made a cutting edge film that shows the raw inside of egos in the urban dating world for all of comedy whipped succeeds with intelligence which is so rare for a first time director especially with a romantic comedy he is a major talent judah domke brian van holt jonathan abrahams and zorie barber round out the cast with depth and very strong performances as the would be slick men you've got to see these guys go to work and get caught in web check out the trailer on worth the minute download
i enjoyed watching this well acted movie very was well by actress helen hunt and actors steven weber and jeff was a very interesting with drama and the beginning to the very reccomend that everyone take the time to watch this made for television is excellent and has great acting
on the surface written on the wind is a lurid glossy soap opera about the sexual dysfunctions of a texas oil family but underneath it all is a deep social commentary on life director douglas sirk scores again with another univeral sudser robert stack falls in love with lauren bacall the problem is that best pal rock hudson loves her too when stack finds out sterile and bacall ends up pregnant the fireworks fly and the all-too-good dorothy malone won an oscar for her portrayl of texas biggest nympho who is shunned by hudson good epic soap opera
this is the first out of that i've given any movie what made this movie so good for me constant action there isn't any slow parts great acting smart writing i also liked the filming style where the shakiness and different angles just made it feel like you are a part of the scene finally i get to see an action movie that doesn't try to please all sectors of the public no forced liked the first two bourne movies but i loved this after watching this movie you will be full of adrenaline and you may want to calm down a bit before driving your car
monarch cove was one of the best friday drama shown in a long am asking the writer to please write a long series and air it on lifetime person was very interesting and did a wonderful job with their lines to make the plot come true however the movie needs to continue for a long time i would love to see bianca and child grow-up and get a major role in the movie along with the new grandparents planning for her educational future also bring kathy back to see her niece and help foster her was great seeing the grandparents work out their problems but the family business needed to be restored to working let us see how jake and bianca survive through the marriage years
the only reason that i did not give this stars was the dvd format-no menus extras etc however if you have ever had a dream to do something with your life this film is for you if you believe in yourself and your dream do not let anyone or anything stop you this is one of the most life-affirming films that i have ever seen and magical the acting is superb the plot serves the purpose and the opening sequence is fantastic this is one of those films that cult status used to be about i have recommended this film to all of my friends some love it some can't finish it whenever i think or feel that something is impossible i think about alan role in this film sure wish he'd make more films
jox is a great little film ok some of the sets are bad and the acting is not that great but the special effects are very good for a film of this size and age you have to remember that this film is over years old now and was made very cheaply in the place so you cant moan to much about the bad parts so just sit back and watch a cool film with great big robots in it
bill and bogus journey is possible the most excellent film i have ever watched though the acting and scenery etc is poor who cares the story line is brilliant and the jokes and words they come up with are most excellent the ideas are great as well i recommend anyone to see this classic the best part is obviously when they melvin death i was cracking up for minutes and missed the next part of the film this is so much better then the first one which was great as well possibly the funniest movie of all time i think the best parts of the film however are when bill and ted shout excellent and play the guitar solo it was hilarious rock on bill ted and eddie van halen bring out a film
origins of the care bears their cousins if you saw the original film you'll notice a discrepancy the cousins are raised with the care bears rather than meeting them later however i have no problems with that preferring to treat the films as separate interpretations the babies are adorable and fun watching them play and grow my favourite is swift heart rabbit the villain is a delightfully menacing shapeshifter i could empathise with the three children since i was never good at sports either cree summer is excellent as christy the songs are sweet and memorable if you have an open heart love the toys or enjoyed the original this is not to be missed
i've seen this film at least times since and still great every time i see it a very compelling version of the opera carmen with amazing flamenco dancing bare bones sets and of course wonderful telling of carmen is a story within a story with each paralleling the other until the doubly tragic ending obviously a low budget spanish production the film contains dancing by some of premier flamenco dancers the combination of the soaring opera music and the sound of the dancers boots on the wooden stage makes the telling of the story even more independent movie making at best and probably my all time favorite foreign film
have just finished watching this film which upset me greatly have also been to south africa twice around the time this film is is certainly hard-hitting and the opening scenes tend to set the scene the slow but steady increase of pace hardly allows a break and there are certainly few light never be able to view nigel hawthorne the same again he came across as a very twisted individual and i found myself disliking him more each time he agree with articulate and well thought-out comments
dangerous offender is the story of a seemingly anti-social girl and how she got that way based on a true story and though i was irritated by the one-note depiction ever scowling of the title character and the hard-to-believe dedication of her lawyer i'm forced to accept that life does imitate art and that there are people out there like movie succeeds for me because although little softening of the title demeanour until almost the end one is gradually moved to sympathy for her as the movie shows how she got to her present state which proves to be self-destructive rather than a moving movie which will bring a lump to your throat when you think on it which will be its many that hard to watch sometimes because of bodily functions and suicide is another production that i'm proud to call canadian
i really enjoyed this thriller i wanted to see it again as soon as it was over the cast was excellent the plot was suspenseful and entertaining and it was just an overall enjoyable movie i would rate this as one of the best thrillers i've ever seen the girls in it were really cute also especially denise richards she was very ornery throughout the movie and gave her character some oomph
i'm a huge jane austen fan and besides being a feature-length film true fan wants to see as little left out as possible and that can only be achieved in a mini-series it was really great gwyneth paltrow really captures the slightly clueless but well-intentioned rich girl and jeremy northam is mr knightly with his poise and nobility i wasn't thrilled with ewan mcgregor even though i like him very much as an actor but didn't feel it spoiled the movie at all like i said as a jane austen fan there were things i would have liked to have seen included that weren't but that would have made it much longer than permissible for a feature length film and as it was i felt they really encapsulated the story well i've seen every adaptation of this book and felt this was the best one
in i had just moved to the us from ceylon i was and had been married for a little over three years and was beginning to come out as a lesbian i saw this movie on an old black and white tv with terrible reception alone and uninterrupted in an awakening that seemed like an echo of the story i was living in a small house in tucson arizona and it was summertime like everyone else here i never forgot the feelings the images of this story called forth and its residue of fragile magic and i have treasured a hope that i would see it again someday i'll keep checking in i also wish that someone would make a movie of shirley the other side of venus it also has some of the same delicacy and persistent poignancy
the story and the characters were some of the best i've ever seen the graphics were good for the ps and the cut scenes and voice overs were amazing i beat the game at least times and loved every second of it i felt the problems the protagonist faced were believable and realistic and i believe it deserves a sequel or at least a remake if they remade it for the i would buy the system for just that game and maybe its amazing also the idea and execution of the dragoon system is enough to warrant a rental and on top of that ad the inventive although sometimes buster wand combat addition system and the plot makes this game a definite buy
i loved the the film it beautifully analyzes italian petty bourgeois society how the leftists of the have given up all their ideals and come to a happy arrangement which they don't want disturbed for instance the aging psychoanalyst who is jealous of his own son and doesn't want to be reminded of his more radical a long time wanted to buy the video after having seen the movie a couple of times on the big screen and on tv but it seems to have completely disappeared from the market even in italy no one in the book shops knew about the film a great one sex scene which everyone seems to go on about does the film no harm
i loved it and was so shattered that there not making another season i wish they would it was the best show ever probably not any chance of them deciding to not cancel the show is there ha ha i wish there was though i would be so so excited i really would i miss it and was especially shattered not to know what happens to jason i think they should make another one it i also think its silly that u have to writr ten lines to post a comment it makes your comment drag no one will read it i really want to know what would have happened between jason and nicole maybe they could make a spin off
this is a excellent start to the film career of mickey rooney his talents here shows that a long career is ahead for him the car and truck chase is exciting for the era this start of the andy hardy series is an american treasure in my book spring byington performance is excellent as usual please mr rooney or owners of the film rights take a chance and get this produced on dvd i think it would be a winner
what makes midnight cowboy into a successful movie is the way in which joe buck becomes bonded to ratso rizzo through a series of hardships that affect them both there really aren't many glimpses of hope in this film for either character but the hard realities that beset them both give the film its own type of optimism that these men can at least find humanity within each film features jon finest performance and probably dustin as well the rest of the cast is made up of unknowns though it is rounded out by a fine series of character actors including the cowpoke on the bus at the start of the film also for those interested andy apprentice paul morrissey shows up briefly during the party you haven't seen this movie it is essential check it out
i had the pleasure of seeing this film at the rhode island international film festival and was very impressed tess nanavati is clearly a great screenwriter and i would love to see more of her films if she could do what she did with the budget of this film i'm very anxious to see what she can do with a major picture kudos to the cast for their terrific performances little girl was gold and to whoever composed the music the warped row your boat blew me away very creative film all really hope to see it come out on video or dvd because i'd buy it in a second if you get the chance you should definitely see this film
i caught this movie late at night on cable and i was pleasantly surprised i can only imagine the reason this movie was not better known is because the subject matter is very disturbing but if you can handle the sexual abuse topic it is a well acted suspenseful and very interesting movie both richard gere and claire daines are very good in it and although the subject matter is not for the faint of heart the movie doesn't go out of its way to be brutal either for highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys serial killer and suspense type movies
a well cast summary of a real event well actually i wasn't there but i think this is how it may have been like i think there are two typically american standpoints evident in the film communistophobia and parallels to adolf hitler these should be evident to most independent observers anyway boothe does a great performance and so do lots of other well-known actors the last twenty minutes of the film are unbearable and i mean it anyone who can sleep well after them is abnormal why so terrible it all happened and it probably looked just like that but actually did that last scene on the air station really take place
this episode is certainly different than all the other columbos though some of the details are still there the setup is completely different that makes this columbo unique and interesting to watch even though at times you might wish for the old columbo i liked it a lot but then i like almost any columbo
as in amelie recent french films seem to be taking a stereotypical male-female relationship slant centered on a female finding her one true love in this case desperation leads to a convict which leads to her evolution into a mob prototype clever and surprising story in many ways except that the female is there to support the those of us that don't speak french the subtitles are a little quick but not soundtrack as seems to be increasingly the case with european films is great and in perfect sync with the variations nothing seems forced visually it reminds me of various urban horror movies a wes craven in chicago feel to it
simple meaningful and delivers an emotional punch i regularly trail through dull short films and always nice to come across something that has a simple and enlightened message without pretensions or self indulgent boy at school has to attend a lesson when his friend plays truant and is given the most important lesson of his life only to find that when there are not enough copies to go around he has to share with the school most short films featuring children or actors these kids hold their own and believable the soundtrack nicely complements the emotion of the piece and the punchline of the film works well
la teta y la luna is a symbolic spain film everything that in this film occurs has a symbolic meaning it is totally different to the usual movie that one has film is good but it will be good only for the people who want look for the meaning of everything in the tale i must advice that this is not a sample enjoy
many of these other viewers complain that the story line has already been attempted that may be so but the addition of the narrator and like scenery makes this show a must watch with adult innuendo throughout the series and a touch of childhood through the set the show is both reminiscent and invigorating the investigative portion of the show is not what drags viewers in the twisted plot and love lines scattered throughout this seeming paradise are what keep loyal viewers coming back for more this is a success that abc should never let go of bravo abc lost was getting old way to revitalize prime time episodes prior to the writers strike left audiences wanting more
that movie was awesome i can't get over songs i think i'm a little too old for musicals but that movie deserves some credit here guys my especial favorite was jack wild me being a british actor lover you can't restrain me from all those nice-looking fresh faced young men i never knew that when jack was doing that movie he was sixteen he looks like an year old short what helps try posting up your replies fellow posters so i can relate to your experiences oh and about oliver reed that guy bill sikes i think that drone look is really familiar any idea where starred in before if so post it up i'd really like to know
my personal feeling is that you cannot divorce this movie from its underpinnings like so many reviewers tend to do this is not about growing up on main street usa it is about growing up in yugoslavia at a time when it was torn between the east and the west just like the guys are torn between esther and everybody else and esther is torn between the tovarish joe and the guys there is shame in certain situations that is lost on an audience that has never lived under tito i feel the movie is under-rated and it is too bad we have lost the director movies like this make freedom feel more important it is not just another eastern european coming of age is a sensitive portrayal of teenagers walking a fine line that might eventually lead them to real freedom
this film to me is a very good have a german shepherd myself and i wish to god he was like jerry lee i hope too that there is another in the running with jerry lee and dooley in them i don't care what any one say these two films were excellent
even this early in his career capra was quite accomplished with his camera-work and his timing this is a thin story and quite predictable at times but he gets very good performances out of his cast and has some rather intricate camera moves that involve the viewer intimately the first part looks like a cinderella story though anyone with brains can see that the bottom will fall out of that the rich prince will lose his because of his good cast and fast pace easy to get caught up in the clichés then the movie does become more original as the married couple have to find a way to make a living the ending is very predictable but satisfying i also want to compliment the title-writing very witty and fun
this is definitely one of the best movies i've ever it has a genuinely touching screenplay fine actors that make subtlety a beautiful art to watch an actually elegant romance a shame that that kind of romance just doesn't seem to exist anymore lovely songs and lyrics the final song an artistic score and costumes and sets that make you want to live in them the ending was only a disappointment in that i was expecting a spectacular film to have a brilliant but it was still more wonderful then the vast majority of movies out there definitely check this movie over and over again there are many details you miss the first time that deserve a second look
wow i loved this movie and love judy marte this girl isn't just an awesome pretty face funny and really really talented she made me laugh many times just by being very naturally rough with victor who was desperately hitting on her we'll be seeing her a lot in the next coming years and probably also from director peter sollett and co-star victor victor vargas is one of the best film i saw in a long time very refreshing true nice funny well filmed it got it all good story good actors good film you like simple slow paced real life urban movies like maybe jersey girl from kevin smith you'll love victor vargas better
this movie is very great the acting is fine with excellent casting of corbin bernsen as the perfectionistic dentist who freaks out and tortures his patients in the beginning he sees his wife with the poolman and then he goes crazy he also takes revenge on his wife and the poolman beside the patients he tortures the most special effects are also beautiful although some are really fake a drilled-out tongue that has laid for night outside and is still red in the morning but the torture scenes are absolutely well-done though this movie has the weak point that it is very slow between the heavy parts are sometimes just extremiously boring parts but for the real this is a must-watch
will smith is one of the best actors of all time i don't know how he does it i read books constantly but if there is a movie with will smith i will watch it he has a rare gift of pulling you into the movie and holding you there this movie is one of the best movies i have seen yet i watched it on saturday and i still cannot get it out of my head amazing and sad all at the same time thanks again will you must watch this movie from beginning to end to understand every part of the movie you cannot miss a thing make sure you have plenty of kleenex and your sitting next to you so you can cuddle well worth the money that you will pay to watch it don't wait for it to come on tv
i remember originally seeing this film at radio city music hall when it came out i didn't really understand the humor back then but this movie can make me laugh out all due respect to george burns walter matthau really deserved the oscar for this film his performance is the fact that he was years younger than his character willie clark his mannerisms are first-rate know what kind of songs he wrote and when speaking to the spanish-speaking guy at the front desk no no no enchilada absolutely to richard benjamin who played straight man to just wish this was on dvd because my vhs recording is getting a bit had no interest in seeing the remake with woody allen because in no way can it match the original
this is a lovely tale of guilt-driven on a lonely night stroll in riga passes by a woman on the wrong side of a bridge railing he passes by without a word only the splash in the water followed by a cry for help causes him to act and then only too little and too film chronicles his efforts at finding out more about the woman on a troll of local bars he finds her pocketbook he pieces more and more of her life together his look changes as his obsession grows he has to make things right in a marvelously filmed dialog with the bastard ex-boyfriend he forces alexej to face up to the guilt that both long takes a gritty soundtrack to accentuate the guilt barking dogs footsteps lovely film noir with a lovely twist a good indie ending
i must say i was surprised with the quality of the movie it was far better than i expected scenario and acting is quite good the director made a good job as well although some scenes look a bit clumsy it is a decent movie overall the idea was definitely brilliant and the truth did not reveal itself till the very end the mental hospital atmosphere was given quite good the plot was clear consistent and well thought some people may find it a bit boring though since the story line is very focused and they take their time for character and story development moral of the story it is a decent movie for its genre and it is astonishingly good
danes and beckinsale have been best friends since forever and after they graduate they decide to take a trip to thailand due to a incident they meet a young attractive mysterious stranger who invites them to go with him hong kong for the weekend but at the airport alice and darlene are mistaken for drug smuggling heroine and they are sent to prison now time for ultimate survival and true friendship this was a pretty good movie i've seen it a couple of times and after a while you notice that they are a few holes in the plot but the movie still keeps you entertained claire danes did a great job as usual she is a great actress i would give brokedown palace
by hook or by crook is a tremendously innovative film from a pair of immensely smart and talented filmmakers harry dodge and silas howard they manage to tell an original story in a distinctive cinematic style and beautifully shot by ann t rosetti and wonderfully written truly poetic lead characters are true heroes and serve as a rare kind of role for butch dykes and trannies everywhere this film has so much energy so much poignant passion and scruffy san francisco heart to it i can't recommend it highly enough best butch buddy movie of all time

this movie is why i found this website i couldn't find this movie anywhere else i am so glad we found it here we have seen it on tv before and wanted desperately to find it and buy and have several friends interested in buying it one other poster commented that it is was boring though i must say that it is not especially if you are a horse person you will love this movie the horses are awesome well trained and the movie is well done it is certainly one we will be purchasing for our home dvd library we will be recommending it to our friends the bond made between man and horse in this film was so inspiring and made you want to spend more time with your horses this is certainly a movie that we will watch several times
this film caught me off guard when it started out in a cafe located in arizona and a richard decides to have something to eat and gets all hot and bothered over a very hot sexy waitress while rex steps out of the cafe he sees a state trooper and asks you fast and then all hell breaks loose in more ways than one nancy allen to is a tv reporter and is always looking for a news scoop to broadcast maggie winds up in a hot tub and rex comes a calling on her to tell her he wants a show down western style with the local top cop in town this is a different film however nancy allen and richard grieco are the only two actors who help this picture together
splendid film that in just eight minutes displays an unusual genre mix mystery thriller musical briefly we are allowed to tell about the story a girl comes into a european cafeteria and then soft transit from nonsense mystery to narrative logic in a no time no place way vigalondo managed a delight in by means of imagination and despite to the tightest of of the unity of time-space the film reaches the intensity of a short poem a haiku spain land of quick poetry in the early must see for reassuring our belief in young cinema outside the states
strange yet emotionally disturbing chiller about fed up middle-aged man h macy who finally decides to leave the family business for hire run by his quietly over-demanding father sutherland while seeing a shrink ritter and flirting with another patient about a major dilemma but panic is a top-notch thriller that looks like american beauty meets the professional macy and sutherland are the stand-outs here remarkable debut for first-time henry bromell i'm surprised that this movie didn't get a chance to stay in theaters for more than a couple of weeks
well when watching this film late one night i was simple amazed by greatness fantastic script great acting costumes and special effects and the plot twists wow in fact if you can see the ending coming you should become a writer i would recommend this film to anyone especially if i like them
i'm italian and when i've recently looked again this film i astonished for its beauty the first time i was years old and i liked it but today i can appreciate it with adult mind and feelings now i can understand it was a masterpiece of a special season of the italian cinema etc by that time gone hollywood epic films are fun perhaps this odyssey had no english version because is not enough funny not suitable for pop-corn and coke audience however suitable for homer pathos and existentialist italy was recently released a very good dvd version integral with excellent colors you can find it in some file sharing but italian only and without subtitles too bad also the dialogs and the voices of this film are remarkable
grand canyon falls under a very scarce category it is a very clever film with very clever dialogs and food for thought everywhere from start to end i have the impression that it never made it to deserved ranking never will because of simplicity this kind of flick needs sensitive watchers pity thought that imdb makes me write ten lines because this is in no way necessary in this particular case anyway in order to fulfill this request i will tell you that the weak point of the film if any is in the acting not that it is bad but it could have been done much better exception made for kevin kline who was perfect go ahead and watch it
a lot is dated in this episode like most twilight zone episodes such as the incredibly sexist military uniform and some things are so unbelievable like the easy availability of clean water still consider the year this was made and the time and you quickly understand why this episode is so special as you watch it has a nice sense of hope something missing from a lot of twilight zones as well as an interesting female character the fact that she rarely speaks something else rare on the twilight zone two is a great example of how the twilight zone in just over minutes could pack more emotion and drama than most two hours movies today and great to see two people who became american icons so early in their careers
best out and out action film it is a superbly enjoyable movie with some interesting characters solid performances and renny harlins direction is stylishly assured stallone is rarely this interesting in his action films and he certainly looks the part in terms of the action scenes this was one of the best action films of the year and one of the most thrilling and enjoyable of the a definite genre classic as a stallone fan this is one i look back on with fond memories plenty of superb action and sly in prime action man form action lovers appreciate this film because it has all the hallmarks that make a good aciton film the film looks great and there is great support from janine turner michael rooker and john lithgow
whether this movie is propaganda or not firmly believe it is not it really shows the power of media the importance of this documentary is not to show how good of a man chavez is it is really to demonstrate the way the bolivarians saw how it happened the chavez way of seeing it although it may seem wrong and bias to support a film i think the point of view shown in the movie is utterly legitimate the venezuelian people via the private media corporation of venezuela only saw a one side perspective of the coup the neo-liberal side this movie shows us the way the bolivarians saw it call it propaganda i say a judgment call on your part
i really don't understand why people get so upset and pan this movie remember folks this is an snl movie not anything that is supposed to be unpredictable and original in plot or direction the ladies man is a hilarious movie albeit stupid at times with a wacked-out cast and as usual wonderful performances by will ferrel and tim meadows yes some of the jokes are stupid and yes the characters are unbelievable but its comedy i really don't understand how anyone couldn't laugh a lot during this hilarious film anyway all i ask is that people take this as it snl silly and irreverent comedy nothing that will win awards but nonetheless some modern comedy gold apricot
the movie is great like every other international project that includes strong impressions three of them bosnia and egypt should've been cut out especially bosnian clip which is pathetic beyond all reason and doesn't contain a single original thought or element on own everything else is really great unrecognizable for most of americans known for the rest of the world unfortunately clips speak about misery of the people all over the world and as i see it there are so many of those who won't give a damn about loach penn inarritu lalouche imamura
of the elements that make this the best at this point i have to say is christine mcintire scene when poisoned and her reaction are truly magnificent i imagine that as one poster suggested christine was trying to hold back laughter during that scene but it actually made her seem even more deliciously evil to be smiling at possibly character who helps this stand out is the goon his look was a great cross between horrific and comedic goof-ball hardly a character i would choose to meet in a dark alley or for that matter anywhere i would have preferred a bit of true whodunit mystery in this but hey when a short is this good going to complain not i
superbly developed characters into the lots of funny situations full of spirit absurdness and serbian mentality movie is a great comedy enjoyable interesting unpredictable best point in a film characters then humor itself story and dialogs humor has inner development rare in serbian movies so it is consequence of characterization is well motivated spontaneous and cogent also it is sharp intelligent and lucid most of the movies unfortunately had constructed humor a joke and put it into a mouth or ordinary situation comedy burlesque farce some of the art immortality are incorporated in this movie little masterpiece hardly reachable
this is an absolutely charming film one of my favourite romantic comedies extremely humorous and the cast is wonderful though laurence olivier is mostly associated with his shakespearean work he shows in this film that he is by no means restricted to play only classical theatre he manages the transition from the cynical divorce solicitor who tries to avoid women and their traitorous ways to the lovesick puppy that falls for lady x played by merle oberon effortlessly the dialogue is wonderfully witty and refreshing and the atmosphere enchanting ralph richardson was a delight to watch as well i highly recommend it
this film is harmless escapist fun something the recent tomb raider film lacked i can't wait to get the dvd how can people give this a low score and still go and see titanic without a guilty conscience i do not know anything with karen kopins in her underwear has got to rate an extra point or two
when i was a kid i totally loved both bill ted movies the other night bogus journey was on and since it was at least years since i last saw it i decided to tune in and i loved it all over again this film is still funny after all those years excellent adventure is better but this one rocks just the same sure some of the perfomances are a bit cheesy but hey this entire film is cheesy in a cool way plus it features the coolest personation of death ever in a movie concluding totally like non bogus movie dude way excellent station
a great story based on a true story about a young black man and all the difficulties along the road being that this is denzel first ever movie that he himself was gonna direct i have to admit i was a tad sceptical but who wouldn't be but then again a great actor with plently of years of experience and the end result turned out great the story is told in a great way making you that has had difficulties during your childhood and young adulthood see yourself in those situations so it hits you hard letting you know your not the only one going through hell in all a touching story about a young man trying to make it in this up world story is based on the life of antwone fisher born august cleveland ohio usa whom was also the writer of this movie strongly recommended
this film makes a strong comment about the italian people of the time the use of the mirrors to enhance the revelations of the characters is lovely and i can't not mention the beauty and magnificence of sophia loren and mastroianni i love them both their way of interacting is so beautiful and natural that you may question whether or not the camera is actually there the husband in his brief role is also excellently portrayed as the fascist italian who commands his wife and children but in his own way a loving father the beginning scenes with hitler at piazza venezia with all the italians is incredible and really places the film historically i loved the film and i also agree that it is funny it isn't more renowned
excellent film the whole picture was filmed in budapest so i feel proud my little problem was that the trains in the film belonged to the hungarian state railways and it is plain to see that they were used in big train not in the local railway according to the story chikatilo picked up his victims in local railway stations apart from this the film is superb
these are one of the movies that don't require any brain or thinking a very funny time pass which you forgot in the next hour or so i was really surprised with john acting he usually playing the gangster like character with the emotionless from that to playing the complete opposite and does it managing to shine amongst the comic geniuses such as paresh rawal and akshaye kumar i was also quite surprised with the girls because there roles don't require much talent but mostly moaning about the other girls i was surprised as they managed to establish and actual persona and you could differentiate between them which is a good thing also majority of songs are is colourful and fun so on a boring sunday evening this will sure lighten your mood
actually i liked this movie very very much not because of plot acting jokes no i liked it because one of the worse movies ever created so lame so bad that it becomes terribly funny some jokes are actually cool but the rest makes me pray for unemployment for the scriptwriter men in white are so dumb and stupid that you can do only two things turn the tv off or roll on the floor laughing helps a lot i chose the second option
this film is one of the finest american b-movies of the if you're looking for a serious film look elsewhere however if you're looking for some action a lot of laughs and a tongue in cheek variation on cops fighting gangsters this is well worth watching everyone chews the scenery a bit but really what the film is all about and everyone is quite funny donald sutherland and john lithgow have great chemistry and need to do another film together
if you lived through the this film can be at times painful and other times quite joyous all there but the small print in the counter culture tabloids prevalent at the time these are the roots of a social revolution that is still playing out don't speak too soon for the still in spin for the times they are a-changin while the film focuses on the revolutionary nature of lsd and dissemination at the time that alone played a tremendous hand in the evolution of the intelligentsia influencing engineers scientists and aiding in the hyper-development of computer related activities a salute to the filmmakers from one who was there you've captured the era better than i've seen before
wonderful romance comedy drama about an italian widow planning to marry a man comfortable with aiello until she falls for his headstrong angry brother cage the script is sharp with plenty of great lines the acting is wonderful the accents been told are letter perfect and the cinematography is beautiful new york has never looked so good on the screen a must-see primarily for cher and olympia both fantastic and richly deserved the oscars they got a beautiful funny film a must see
i've watched a bunch of episodes of cold case since its premiered now that it immediately follows the amazing race but this was one of the best instances of writing and acting i've seen from the house of bruckheimer the casting especially of the younger officers was spot on and the script and editing the soundtrack and the acting made this episode a tour d'force if i were the producers i would submit this episode for emmy consideration it amazing how complete a portrait was made of coop and jimmy within the confines of s minute episode that takes a lot of talented people doing their best i hope is advance warning of when this episode is repeated because i'm sure i'll notice a lot that i did not notice the first time around
put quite simply this film is starts off simply looking like a study of a rebellious young girl and goes on to become a beautifully crafted horror expect gore or zombies this is psychological and just as he would also do in candyman bernard rose manages to convey the horror that is not being time you watch this film you realise more about happening and about how the two worlds in this film have never been scarier
this film is amazing just like a nightmare the bizarre story the dark decors the swarming insects everywhere the idea jumps and the surrealistic dreams really great people who love cult movies or very dark thrillers will find this fantastic it seems a little to the films of david lynch the strange story the bizarre dreams the red curtains nuit noire contains almost no plot rather a succession of surrealistic happenings nightmares and meetings a drawback if the film had a really fascinating plot full of tension with a captivating denouement i would give it a out of but missing and why i gave the movie an nuit noire is a film worth watching search that dvd and you'll be rewarded
even though this was a disaster in the box office it is my favorite film it gives a powerful message of family it has a lot of violence and has one song with a bunch of girls in bikinis compared to other bollywood films the action scenes in this movie are more realistic it is an incredible combination of akshay kumar and amitabh bachchan if you want to see the indian godfather amitabh portrays that in this film don't read reviews by critic they're just ignorant this movie has good mix of comedy romance drama and especially action so if you want to see action more realistic than main hoon good movie this is the movie
a life is a very good animated feature this movie is for younger children but it is also a great movie for people my age the story is about an ant named flik he brought havoc onto his colony when he destroyed the food that were for the superior grasshoppers he gets banished and he must find bigger bugs to fix the mess this movie is a classic because it is a good movie and it is a pixar movie the animation is brilliant especially for the late the story is good but a little more detail would be suffice the voice acting is good as with most animation movies the music is nice to listen to nothing special but it earned an nomination for one of the music categories overall this movie struck me as awestruck this is a good movie for all families i rate this movie
the contaminated man is a good film that has a good cast which includes william hurt natascha mcelhone peter weller katja woywood michael brandon nikolett barabas hendrick haese désirée nosbusch arthur brauss and christopher acting by all of these actors is very good hurt and weller are really excellent in this film i thought that they performed good the thrills is really good and some of it is surprising the movie is filmed very good the music is good the film is quite interesting and the movie really keeps you going until the end this is a very good and thrilling film if you like william hurt natascha mcelhone peter weller katja woywood michael brandon nikolett barabas hendrick haese désirée nosbusch arthur brauss christopher cazenove the rest of the cast in the film actio thrillers dramas and interesting films then i strongly recommend you to see this film today
only seen season so far but this is just great a wide variety of people stuck on a island nobody are who they seem to be and everybody seems to have loads of skeletons in their closets it sounds like melrose place meets the crusoe family and why is that so great it probably is not but then ad a spoon full of x files a dose of what and a big hey and a island that is everything you ever dreamed of in your freakiest nightmares and you'll be lost to the story got so many twists and turns it is unbelievable great set up solid acting with a liberating acceptance that at the end of the everybody is human almost everybody i think with good and bad sides but weird oh so weird
the good earth is a great must is tear-jerking and very heart warming it caters to the enhancement of values-formation on perseverance humility and the love of story can be related to our life today especially that poverty is at the threshold the way on how we respond to such problem is very crucial and if a person is not strong enough to face such he may be left defenseless and useless i am very pleased on how the characters justified their roles even the young emotions has captivated the audience the movie may have been done in black and white but the story is so captivating that you do not want to end that makes it really great there should be a re-make for this very nice movie
i first saw breaking glass when it was released in england in loved it then and having just caught it in august on a canadian station it still is great the only thing i regret is i can't find the sound track or the dvd in the care to shed some light or must i order it from some over priced internet company but getting back to the film the music stands up to the test of time had something to say about it was the same decade i moved to canada for some of the same reasons one being thatcher and what she was doing to the country at the time please if you get the chance watch this movie you won't be sorry
this movie is fun to watch doesnt have much of a plot there isn't a plot but there are good jokes and situations that you will laugh at the basic storyline is cheech is trying to have a nice date while chong is partying with cousin smoke dope go in a music store a massage parlor a comedy club and even go into someones house they don't even know rated r
this movie is directed by renny harlin the finnish miracle stallone is gabe walker cat and mouse on the mountains with ruthless terrorists renny harlin knows how to direct actionmovie stallone needed this role to get back on track snowy mountain is very good place for action movie and who is better to direct movie where is snow ice cold and bad weather than finnish man action is good music in the film is spectacular the bad guy is john litghow other stars micheal rooker the portrait of serialkiller janine turner strong medicine the is placed in beautiful place and it is very exciting movie overall good movie extreme ääliöt special collectors edition with good extras comig soon in finland straight to video
my grandmother bought me this film when i was always love scary movies and even then i enjoyed it the atmosphere is awesome and the story original and entertaining i especially love the scenes where the rv is under attack in the desert the rocks are actually convincing for such a low-budget flick the acting is above average for these kinds of films and the music is eerie this is definitely an uder-rated gem i recommend it to anyone who likes these strange films from the late seventies early eighties such as alice sweet alice poor pretty eddie nightmare hospital massacre and return of the aliens the deadly spawn definitely a classic
i had no idea that mr izzard was so damn funny it really boggles the mind that he is not more well known his command over the crowd and his timing is monologue about star wars will kill ya too if only all the stand up performers had his wit
what a fun movie experience i was expecting a sappy kids movie and found that i enjoyed it more than my teens take a tissue not sad just moving in parts finally its a feel good flick for the whole family note hours so consider leaving the littlest home for this one ap
the makers of this fine film did a terrific job of getting you involved with the they suffered through this horrible horrific scene in the woods was done so superbly that you forget that these men were just have never gotten so immersed in a film as i have this reynolds and jon voight were never better on well as fine performances by ned though he appeared only man who authored the book upon which the film is the sheriff of is somewhat be shielded from this is cinema
i voted this a out of simply because it is the best animated story i have been able to see in quite some time the animation is stunning the artwork behind each and every landscape was beautiful from the colors to the lighting to the not standard fare of artistry i was amazed moving beyond the beauty on the screen you are immersed in a storyline that is at once timeless and at the same turn fresh character development is brief yet these touchstone moments are exactly what is needed to clue the viewer in to what and why and how the character has come to where they stand i'm impressed with the entire affair and think this is a must see for the entire family
this movie really kicked some ass i watched it over and over and it never got boring angelina jolie really kicked some ass in the movie you should see the movie you won't be disappointed and another reason you should see the movie is because the guy from the x-files is in it david duchovny
this has just been broadcast on bbc and i am absolutely delighted to have seen it as the credits rolled the cast alone made certain that i would give it a go after just five minutes i was completely immersed in this beautiful it was formulaic and predictable but that somehow added to charm the flashbacks to the forties were wonderfully placed and captured a feeling equalled in few real feel-good film punctuated throughout with outstanding music when released i'll buy it
i've seen hundreds of silent movies some will always be classics as nosferatu metropolis the general and wings but among them my favorite is this film may not be the a favorite yes in fact when i looked it up on imdb i noticed i immediately laughed to myself because the movie was so gosh-darn cute and well-made marion davies proved with this movie she really had great talent and was not just william randolph story involves a hick from georgia coming to hollywood with every expectation that she would be an instant star her experiences and the interesting cameos of stars of the era make this a real treat for movie buffs and a must-see
series has got off to a great start i don't think you need to have watched series to get a grasp of whats happening but like any series its nice to feel some sense of the characters and to care about what happens to them and this show makes you think like that these women seem to lead glamorous and exciting lives yet the premise is believable and realistic so the twists and turns that arrive thanks to their love and sex lives are exciting to watch but you also know that these are problems that happen to real women too its about the decisions we make as women and how sometimes we are led down certain paths in our lives rather than consciously making those choices
this is absolutely one of the best movies i've ever seen it takes me on a a roller-coaster of emotions i laugh and cry and get disgusted and happy and in love all this in a little over two hours of time actors are all brilliant i have to mention the leading actor of course michael nyquist he does a remarkable job i also admire the actor who plays tore who plays this mentally-challenged young man in such a convincing way he sort of reminded me of leonardo di caprios roll in gilbert grape and then there is the most beautiful song in the world recommend this for everyone to see and enjoy
i saw this film last night on cable and it is extraordinary what i love most about it is that it is understated and low-key but deeply heartfelt henry thomas played the child in performance is masterfully inarticulate is supposed to be a man of few words david straithern is a wonderful crazy villain and miraculously that we're talking about a hollywood product here a baby serves as a main character but one who doesn't act or have lines but rather just is is luminous at that interesting to note that thomas mysterious relationship w was the core of that film while his bond w the baby serves as the core of a good there is the what music gillian tunes are wonderful the entire score is gorgeous hill country film is wonderfully atmospheric i recommend it highly
i think the movie was pretty good will add it to my clasic collection after all this time i believe i saw other posters who reminded some of the pickier people that it is still just a movie maybe some of the more esoteric points defy logic but a great many religious matters accepted on faith fail to pass the smell test if you're going to accept whatever faith you subscribe to you can certainly accept a movie is it just me or has anyone else noticed the aja-yee dagger is the same possessed knife lamonte cranston had so much trouble gaining control of in the shadow no mention of it in the trivia section for either movie here but i would bet a dollar to a donut the same prop
i participate in a symposium and this film was shown after we had already seen a not so great film and participated in a minute discussion even though it was incredibly late and we were weary the entire audience really enjoyed i thought the film was hilarious in all the right spots and i loved the quirky cast of characters they really grow on you in the film
can any one help find out the title and artist of the song that was played at least halfway through the movie i can't remember what scene was playing the words in the song are of a ballad some of the lyrics go like natures way of telling you somethings wrong natures way of telling it in a song natures way of forgiving you please help me with this question thanks so much i have been searching the internet for days i can't get this song out of my mind so now this will challenge me to find some one out there who may be able to help mer with this matter i wish i would of been paying attention to the scene when it was playing
dreamquest is by far the best porn movie i've ever viewed this is a must see and if you're skeptical about your little ones watching it just skip over the naughty scenes of course this shortens the movie to a length of about minutes but even then enjoyable this movie is quite excellent and beats out almost any shawshank redemption
when i was a little girl my dad owned a video store this was among my favorite movies i hadn't heard much about it since then nor did i really remember anything about it it having been forgotten in the wake of don other probably better films i managed to track it down a few weeks ago however and was pleasantly surprised again set in new orleans in the the animation is delightful and the songs are memorable there are a few goofs in continuity if you look hard enough but they generally don't detract from the storyline which leaves you smiling maybe even a little misty-eyed if you are a lover of animals the characters are believable even a little too grown-up for younger watchers as well two paws up and for those of you who haven't seen it in a while definitely worth a re-watch
this movie is an incredible piece of work it explores every nook and cranny of the human mind focusing on the characters relationships with the people around them stellar performances all around this one had me weeping for about half an hour straight spend some real time with this one
the premise of this anime series is about bread of all things to base a plot on i truly laughed the main character has a special bread making power that he was born with and he goes off to bread baking school i wish it were available on dvd and it doesn't matter if subtitled or dubbed that good even the theme song alone is funny at one point in the theme song an african-japanese man with an afro on horseback wielding a french baguette as if it were a samurai sword these images will not make sense unless you see the anime you'll laugh until your sides hurt it is definitely the most unique anime i have seen thus far
very good was the first time writer richard wilson directed a film also this was a first for samuel goldwyn junior as a producer it is a pleasure to see a very young and pretty angie dickinson as a saloon girl robert mitchum comes to this town dominated by outlaws and is hired as a town tamer but people are worried that he will go too far also about the harm that he will do to the businesses there are some similarities in the story with warlock which was made in this film keeps a very fast and exciting pace it really keeps you on the edge
this is what we can do to each other this is the sort that everbody should see at least does not glorify world it shows that it is the everyday person who is killed mained and debased by war the person on the other side eats sleeps laughs and cry just as we do
this movie is sort of a carrie meets heavy metal about a highschool guy who gets picked on alot and he totally gets revenge with the help of a heavy metal ghost it is such a classic the soundtrack is you've got living legends of metal in it and marc price was great in this film this is a must have for metal fans
this is an important film it challenges the viewer and encourages you to pay attention a lot to like here the director seems interested in taking apart some of the more tired cinematic conventions unlike a lot of recent american cinema this film takes an interest in what it means to make a movie in the first place the dvd includes a lot of bonus features and there are two commentaries that explain the movie for the viewers still befuddled after an initial viewing when the film screened at sundance it made more than a few audience members uncomfortable and angry this is a sunday morning coffee movie not a friday night party movie for the dedicated viewer a treasure trove
it was the night he came home warned the posters for john career-making horror classic set in a small american town halloween centerers around serial killer michael myers attempts to track down his sister laurie strode and in the process eliminates all her friends in rather brutal poor laurie to fight against the seemingly indestructible michael this plot out-line inspired countless horror knock-offs throughout the and continues to do so today as well as a poorly received remake the difference between them and this is quite simply that halloween is the on a very modest tight changed the face of horror in and spawned the sub-genre of sexually promiscuous-teens getting stalked by a wielding psycho
personally i find the movie to be quite a good watch it outlines the actual situation of triads in hong kong and gives the viewer a glimpse of how triads are only that it also shows the viewer how the hong kong police control the triad situation and why the police don't just go all out and wipe out the movie is rather violent due to the gangland methods of killings torture nevertheless the movie stays true to the real world thus the violence on screen is just a reflection of what really recommend this movie to any movie fan another good watch would be dragon squad that movie has more guns than this as in this movie more knives than guns fact i don't remember seeing a single gun
while i had wanted to se this film since the first time i watched the trailer i was in for a deep surprise with this film while some of the elements and actions of the characters seemed a little too the dark nature of the film really makes this a much different experience instead of the feel-good-happy-story this film takes you in another direction that proves to be uplifting but also disturbing most kids won't understand some of the darker moments in the film which makes this film rather watchable for adults i was also impressed with the cinematography using animation and digital animation to create a seamless network of pans and tilts the musical score was once again solid proving hans zimmer is the go-to guy when it comes to animated scores and i never thought i would say i actually enjoyed brian adams music
i consider myself a huge movie buff i was sick on the couch and popped in this film right from the opening to the end i watched in awe at these great actors i'd never seen say great word the filming was beautiful it was just what i needed i hope that this message is heard over any bad comments written by others the director has a heart and it beats with his actors throughout thanku for making a film like this one just wonderfully awkward beautiful kind characters who are flawed and graceful all at once just great i can't submit this without lines in total so i will simply go on to say that i wish for more from this director more from all the actors in this film and more from the writer i didn't want it to end the end
after just having watched the deer is a movie jacknife had big shoes to has same themes as the deer devastating effects on a person after the vietnam de niro is in this in the deer hunter and is very good is kathy this movie belongs to ed gives a and impactful movie is based on a stage there are one or two scenes where that felt obvious to that i just mean that for those one or two scenes it felt like i was watching a stage was not that big a doesn't really diminish the actually really liked this not an epic like the deer are about similar era and have similar they are two very different thought the deer hunter was i also think this movie was the acting in this one that makes it so is a
clever gritty witty fast-paced sexy extravagant sleazy erotic heartfelt and corny footlight parade is a first-class entertainment what the movies are all realistic satirical treatment gives a fresh edge to the material and its pace and line delivery are breathtaking to think that they only started making feature talking pictures years before this the brilliance of the dialogue cannot be matched anywhere today especially considering that realism has taken over and engulfed contemporary film was made at a time when the hayes code restricting content was being ignored and the result is a fresh self-referential critical and living cinema that spoke directly to contemporary audiences suffering through the depression and the general angst of the age i'd recommend watching any film from this period that is for a vision of what popular cinema can potentially be
people expect no less than brilliant when steven spielberg directs a movie and this movie is no exception some movies i love did poorly at the box office but i'm glad to say this movie isn't one of them nine million dollars which i don't think was bad for back then the characters were fun the animation was clear and not fuzzy and the music was modern too which is unusual for an animated movie i didn't think professor screw eyes or his scary cirus was too scary for little kids targeted audience for this movie but i thought what happened to the creepy professor at the end was a little too dark for a kids movie overall this movie is a fun and enchanting classic that i have loved dearly for years
i have seen just about all of films and they are all beautiful and captivating but this one rises above the rest this movie totally impressed fell in love with pazu and sheeta and their sweet caring friendship they were what made the movie for me of course the animation is also superb and the music captures the feelings in the film perfectly but the characters are the shining point in this movie they are so well developed and full of let me clarify i'm really talking about the japanese version of the movie english subs while the english dub is good it simply pales in comparison to the original language version the voices are better the dialogue everything so i suggest seeing hearing the movie the way it originally was
this may not be one of the best movies ever made but overall a very enjoyable light-hearted piece of froth in which everyone involved seems to be having a good time highly recommended for feel-good factor alone ok so frank acting leaves a lot to be desired but his singing is a great redeeming feature and the songs fit in perfectly with the romantic atmosphere of the film sinatra went on to make many more films where his undoubted acting ability shone through but in this his first venture into hollywood his voice not his acting is his main contribution to this movie i've just watched it again on tv and it still lifts my mood as much as it did the first time i saw it many many years ago
despite its budget limitations this is a great film proof that effort and imagination can overcome lack of cash the opening in which cave-paintings seem to show how some dinosaurs at least survived into the age of human beings is a nice red herring after that a meteor comes down into a lake and causes heat which in turn causes the hatching of a frozen dinosaur egg the cave-paintings suggest instead that this isn't the first time such a thing has happened when the prehistoric beast appears a well-animated plesiosaur which is soon causing disappearances in the local area alright so not jurassic park but still genuine entertainment for fans of monster movies
i admit i've only seen about three of plays juliet macbeth of course hamlet one i liked the other i found so-so and hamlet i just found a masterpiece i'm pleased to tell you that this adaptation is every bit as good as the intense and dramatic play the acting is extremely strong a cast that features kenneth branagh robin williams and billy crystal how can you lose and the change in time period like somewhere between the and plays off beautifully as the characters move about and say their infamous lines straight from the script itself that any fan of the shakespearean play will get chills from if you're into this popular drama i highly urge you to watch this powerful adaptation from shakespearean admirer kenneth branagh
the thing about my folks is a wonderful film about relationships first and foremost an adult son and his father but also that son with his wife his sisters and his mother paul reiser has written a semi-autobiographical movie about his relationship with his father the movie is funny poignant and thought-provoking it led me to re-evaluate my own relationship with both my now-deceased father and my adult son peter falk is excellent as father the role could not have been better cast i hope that both mr falk and mr reiser are recognized in next movie awards for their efforts falk for his performance and reiser for his script
like his early masterpiece the elephant man lynch proves to his detractors that he can tell a straight simple story without losing his artistic touch this is a true story of an elderly retired man played by richard farnsworth who decides to ride a tractor across a few states to pay a final visit to his estranged brother who now stands at door a beautiful score from badalamenti exquisite photography of rural life those aerial corn-field shots and a sly hand that reveals basic humanity this is a beautiful slice of life film its extremely slow pace may lull some viewers to sleep but those who stay for along for the ride will be well rewarded in the end
an excellent movie superb acting by mary alice phillip m thomas and a young irene cara tony king was very realistic in his role of satin this movie was one of the last predominately all black movies of the and unlike the blaxploitation movies of that era this movie actually had a plot and was very well done the movie soundtrack sung by aretha franklin was popular on the charts at the time
i loved this flick when it came out in the and still do i still quote classic lines like say it again and you said you'd rip my balls off sir ron leibman was hot and very funny although it was underrated and disowned by mad i have to say that this little gem will always be a treasure of mine and a movie that i would take with me if sent to a deserted island i only wish that someone would release the dvd because my vhs tape is about worn out if you like cheesed out comedy this is definitely for you and should be considered a cult classic it is military humor at best and worse rent it if you can't own it
while the story is sweet and the dancing and singing in the main part of the film are a joy the uniqueness of the film what makes it a masterpiece is the dream sequence it features the combination of the highest form of truly american music the engaging beauty of french impressionistic art enthralling choreography his rapturous pas de deux d'amour really a separate genre with the most magnificent palette of color ever devised for the set matching the surging music and the visual explosion with those dances was a true work of a creative genius and a great artist
i don't know what movie some of these other people watched but they must have seen a different joseph smith prophet of the restoration than the one i think the movie was both well-done and inspiring i think definitely worth watching apparent from the outset that a lot of care went into the making of this film the background scenery is think the film does a good job of portraying joseph smith both as a man and as a prophet spiritual experiences are portrayed with taste and would definitely recommend watching this movie
this movie gets it right as a former usaf aviation cadet i can tell you this movie has it all the tedium of the application process the waiting for word the joy of acceptance the worry about making it through the course the sorrow of watching buddies the best of out the anguish of paying the ultimate price the death of fllow student airmen the glory of graduation always the flying the flying the flying many are called but few are chosen we did for pay what we would have eagerly paid to do
in one of neil best plays creaky cranky ex-vaudeville stars played by walter matthau and george burns are teaming up for a tv comedy special the problem is they haven't even seen each other in over a decade full of zippy one liners and inside showbiz jokes this story flies along with a steady stream of humor good work also by richard benjamin as the harried nephew rosetta lenoire as the nurse and howard hesseman as the tv commercial director steve allen and phyllis diller appear as themselves trivia note the opening montage contains footage from hollywood revue of and shows marie dressler bessie love polly moran cliff edwards charles king gus edwards and the singing brox sisters
the animation was fab and the film funny the two circus bugs were very funny if you waited till the credits at the end you saw a very funny sequence of film where they showed the bugs pretending to do things wrong like in other movies that was clever as it made the characters more human and beliveable
i found this movie hilarious the spoofs on other popular movies of that time were some of the funniest i have seen in this sort of movie give it a try if you saw the movies that this movie is spoofing and you get the humor you should enjoy the the others who watched the movie with me felt the funniest part in the movie is not a spoiler because i will not tell you what actually happens was a scene with the flashy thingy from mib when they first discover the device and do not know what it is does and then again later in the movie you'll understand when you get only complaint about the movie is that i have never been able to find it in dvd so that i could buy a copy
in another one of bugs hare-raisingly wacky shorts the famous works in a department store display case when owner gildersleeve decides to stuff him of course this proves nearly impossible as bugs apparently knows the store better than gildersleeve knows when to cross-dress as always they keep everything coming at top speed and so you have to wonder how hilarious this cartoon must have seemed when it first debuted among other things hare conditioned is a fine example of how the looney tunes looked in the before the termite terrace crowd polished them but don't get me wrong the cartoons were still really good after the refined forms this is a great are rabbits and hares
this was a personal favorite of mine when i was young it had everything that was great with kids movies lovable dinosaurs cute kids an eccentric villain and a few great songs not the typical little and the beast type songs but ones that are atually entertaining i ran into this movie again recently and i still love it as much as ever i recommend that everyone of every age should see this movie and i definitely think that it should be introduced to the younger generations sorry not the most informative i'm in kinda a rush just please trust me all who go against this movie are killing their inner child
i had nowhere to go i was on a flight to vancouver i would probably have missed this film if i hadn't chosen air canada watched on a small screen in the back of the seat in front i found this captivating and mesmerising i did drift in a couple of places and had to skip back but i had to watch to end now i'm looking forward to the dvd release in europe though whether i'll be quite as transfixed when i can walk out the door is yet to be photographic composition is stunning and the film gives so much insight and fills out the story the photographs you have time on your hands
we so often talk of cinema landmarks kane the godfather a bout de souffle one film however is too often overlooked by serious film critics i am talking of course about the classic doc savage film is not only exciting but also seriously explores the issue of exploitation of the developing nations by us imperialism not to mention also possessed the greatest soundtrack in film history of course breathtaking work on flash gordon although a bit of a rarity this film is well worth seeking out it will repay the effort of your search ten-fold
after all these years i still consider this series the finest example of world war ii documentary film making the interviews with the many participants from all countries set this apart from any other project it would be great to see a contemporary burns take on this topic and try to gather information from veterans before they are all gone with modern technology to improve old archival footage and lots of information that has been unearthed since when the world at war was produced an updated version of this series would be welcome the history channel has made some fine shows dealing with many aspects of wwii but an expansive series such as the world at war has not been successfully attempted since the original if you are interested in this era don't miss this series it is required viewing
very nice action with an interwoven story which actually doesn't suck interesting enough to merit watching instead of skipping past to get to the good parts having jenna jameson and asia carrere helps liven it up too jenna in that sweater and those glasses is just astounding worth picking up just to see her
what is contained on this disk is a first rate show by a first rate band this disc is not for the faint of music is incredibly intense and very cool what you will learn when you watch this movie is just why the who was so huge for so long it is true that their records were great but their shows were the top of the heap in when this concert was shot the screaming teenie boppers that threw jelly beans at the beatles were gone and bands audiences had settled down to long and often amazing displays of musical that few audiences have the intellectual curiosity to pursue in the age of canned music by britney and christina what you especially learn here are the amazing things that can happen when gifted musicians are encouraged to improvise try the concert out it really is amazing
in this movie the year looks much like the seventies this is amusing at first but soon the viewer perceives how very different that decadent futuristic world is despite the appearances how many things that we take for granted could become often interact in a peculiar way with no tact or manners or respect i believe this is intentional not bad acting after all who witnessed the social changes in the and may well assume that by an overpopulated inhabitants behave like didn't like most of the action scenes apart the death of the priest too cheap even for the seventies the plot isn't too polished but the great scenes and ideas like the death of sol the way rioters and dead bodies are dealt with the furniture outweigh the shortcomings of this out of
i have seen this movie many many times and i will never get tired of it it is a classic in every sense of the word the movie is hysterically funny and yet quite touching all at the same time for those of you who are not a fan of subtitles or of foreign film in general open your mind this is a great movie for the beginner because the story is so entertaining don't get me wrong it is japanese that is what makes it work but everyone will get something out of it if it is just a great laugh at one of the main characters called mr aoki one of the funniest characters i have ever can't even think of this movie without smiling i love it and i think most people will too
of course you could never go into a theatre and witness the types of sets you get in this film from that point of view it is utter fantasy but who cares it is certainly true that you will not find this film listed in with citizen kane battleship potyomkin and all the other films the pseuds tell us we should be watching films like this are worth a hundred citizen is about what cinema does best great camera-work great settings and great three spectacular scenes at the end are probably best in the order they are presented keeping the best till will gladly watch this film again and again and again and
i was around when i saw this movie first it wasn't so special a few years later i saw it again and that time it made think the best parts of the film are body language and the special effects you wanna watch this movie don't wait for a hollywood made this film was made from approx dollars a copy of and video version as i don't think it had been ever shown in for ever
endearing tale voted ten against all averages for my age and sex not all that much comedy to a i almost wet myself movie although funny enough not a fan of musicals at all so probably a little too much for me but they do give you time to grab a drink or soda without missing anything important maybe a fifties version of when harry met sally ahab no not really but if that is in your top ten like it is mine you will like this movie really it just leaves you with a warm fuzzy feeling reminding you of what romance could and should be like something to shoot for my summary describes it best in very few words quite charming
well this might be one of the funniest movies of all time and sandy gives a tour-de-force performance alas her career never quite took off but at last she will always be remembered for her three first-rate pictures the king of comedy dallas doll and without you i'm nothing she dons into different personas from new york socialite to diana ross to create a biting and hilarious critique of popular culture in america sexy and fierce tender and sensual philosophical and melancholic she convinces the audience in every scene and she actually is really pretty watch this one you're not from iowa you'll certainly enjoy it
this is one of those movies that after watching it you will keep thinking about and coming back to even months after viewing the acting is spectacular for starring two children usually hate movies with whiny kid acting bill paxton is awesome his directorial debut is even better than what i expected of an actor whose most memorable line is game over man game over the movie best part about the movie is the dichotomy between those scenes where the actors play a family and when they are doing their work it really makes the movie believable and it up bill i'll be waiting for more movies sure to love
ice age is not only animation of the year my eyes also the best animated feature i've ever teaser excited me last year and i've spent many happy hours on the website scrat is cool and so are the rest of the sub zero animation is superb your heart really goes out to the characters in this film they have good lines of dialogue and are well developed hard to say which one really steals the experienced their journey with laughter tears and amazement nothing was forced or over done the emotion was genuine especially in the dramatic second half the last film to affect me this deeply was anastasia in also a fox production and before that it was the land before time all possess real charm and seek to entertain all the audience not just the cynics
i first saw this film when i was about it blew me away then and in many respects it still does now but i am less inclined to see it as an accurate historical piece now there is precious little effort made to examine and interact with the racism and thus fails to recognise that the most potent anti racism weapon is to understand it at its very core in those who commit it what we get instead is a dichotomy on the one side beko and woods in panoramic rainbow vision on the other two dimensional characters are portrayed as unapologetic unthinking all makes for a great film story but it worries me that people see the portrayal as accurate
my favourite police series of all time turns to a tv-film does it work yes gee runs for mayor and gets shot the homicide hall of fame turns up pembleton and nearly all of the cops who ever played in this series a lot of flashbacks helps you who seen the tv-series but it amuses the fans too the last five minutes solves another murder and at the very end even two of the dead cops turn up and a short appearance from my favourite coroner juliana cox this is a good film
i also viewed this film at the santa barbara film festival it was an excellent film about adult family relationships paul reiser wrote the film and included some similarities to his family it was funny warm poignant and moving as well as entertaining a film like this would do very well with the word of mouth reviews i would definitely tell my friends and family to see this film only hope they'll have the chance i would rate this film as one of the best movies i've seen in a year it contains no violence action scenes murders sex so evidently distributors question whether or not to pick it up believe me there are people out there who would love to go see a movie like this that has redeeming value instead of the many typical big box office blockbusters we are usually given
after realizing what is going on around us in the news in our homes the whole new world i remembered this show and how obsessed i was watching it every week my town started looking for this series days ago have luck till this moment and i was shocked when i read about it and about cbs i believe they stopped the show because talking about something way ahead of our understanding of the new world it was trying to deliver a hidden message about something terrifying people who stopped it are the same who are controlling the world now i remember in one of the episodes it was talking about the one dollar and the pyramid with the one eye
this documentary is incredibly thought-provoking bringing you in to the lives of two long-time lovers who are in the final stages of aids the past footage of their twenty-some-odd years together really brings their final moments this movie doesn't make you feel the pain and agony of these two fascinating people you don't have a heart
i absolutely loved this film i do not at all relate to all the other comments i have read about it i was completely enthralled through every second found the story gripping the acting intense and the direction spot-on i would literally jump every time the phone would ring close to the end of the movie even though there was nothing scary about the story itself i was soundly on edge through the whole movie and for the rest of my evening found that there were so many perfect choices casting the script the little bits of humor sprinkled in it there were so many points where the film could've gone for the cheap thrill but it never did and that for me put this movie above so many of the mediocre thrillers that have come out for the last number of years
finally a thriller which omits the car chases explosions and other eye catching effects the movie combines a simple plot of a french president with an excellent background it takes a look behind mans behavior with authorities and explains why we would obey almost every order murder which would be given to it shows us how secret services can manipulate the run of history and how hardly they can be controlled the best thing on this movie is that there is no classic hollywood end which can easily be predicted
interesting mix of comments that it would be hard to add anything constructive to however i'll try this was a very good action film with some great set pieces you'll note i specified the genre i didn't snipe about the lack of characterisation and i didn't berate the acting enjoy if for what it is people a well above average action film i could go on but i've made my comment
after you've seen this small likable and comical film you will for sure feel better cheer to yves b pelletier to have given birth to this small magnificent movie moment that according to me will be recognized as a marking movie of year for the quebec the actors isabelle blais emmanuel bilodeau sylvie moreau and stéphane gagnon all deliver a touching performance i would compare the feeling that this wonderful story gives you to the ones that le fabuleux destin d'amélie poulain have given me so if you've like the jean-pierre jeunet magnificent film i would say that you should also like the first movie from yves b pelletier les aimants
a laurel hardy comedy short the boys arrive to sweep the chimneys at the home of professor noodle a mad scientist just perfected his rejuvenation serum stan ollie proceed with their dirty work spreading destruction inside the house and on the roof then the professor wants to try out his new very funny little film the ending is a bit abrupt but much of the slapstick leading up to it is terrific especially good is stan contest of wills at opposite ends of the chimney lucien littlefield as the professor
actually they could not have chosen a better diversified actor to portray little richard than leon he captures little richard to a most believable essence the outfits where wonderful and any person watching this movie will definitely keep a smile on their face through the entire movie although the movie is a little long it keeps your attention with the personality and outfits of little richard in mind the ending should have taken a direction of moving little richard more into the present where you could see him as he has aged into this new millennium he will always be the king of rock-n-roll as far as i am concerned regardless of what the other media says
well not actually this movie is very entertaining though went and saw it with the girlfriend last night and had to use the i think there might be something in my eye routine the movie is a great combination of comedy and typical romance jim carey is superb as a down on his luck reporter who is given the power to change himself and the city in which he resides in fact all the characters are great the movie is not overly funny or sappy good flick to go see with the in all i am not an easy grader thats all from bigv over and out
in my opinion this is a pretty good celebrity skit show i enjoyed seeing greg kinnear as the host there are many reasons why i said that even though hal sparks was an okay host i sometimes wish that greg kinnear hadn't left if you ask me it seems that nobody stays with a tv show throughout its entire run anymore still i enjoyed seeing the various hosts and other people spoofing celebrities if you ask me that was pretty darn funny before i wrap this up i must say that i kind of miss this show now in conclusion i highly recommend this show to all you die-hard sketch show fans you will really enjoy it
the film really challenges your notions of identity and the society we live in it is well made and very powerful the persons in the film are honest and revealing about the world that exists outside of the normative ideological perspective i believe it give great insight into a sub-culture who shakes the very ideas that the viewer has of society it is shocking at times and more powerful because of it some parts were difficult to watch as most reality is but it is not over done its good the first time you watch it but it becomes even better the second or third time around because you have had the chance to wrap your mind around the very topics they discuss and challenge
the second official episode of the columbo series by the book filmed later hit the airwaves first robert culp who would match wits with peter detective in several future installments is terrific as the short-tempered head of a sophisticated private detective agency who murders a wife when she refuses to cave-in to his blackmail schemes the two stars are well-matched in this clever cat and mouse exercise that is one of the best in the series
the club gives a great perspective on world events some have described it as disingenuous or cheesy i find the program to be informative and inspirational it is only natural for many to throw mud on a program that has proved to be so successful there are very few shows that can point to a year track record of success in the world of television media and the club is one of them while mr robertson may have been wrong to say that someone should be assassinated i find it curious that so many people will literally trip over themselves to hop on the bandwagon of criticism i have certainly said some foolish things in my life i would certainly be willing to forgive mr robertson since he puts out a great show
ok i'll be honest when i first saw the trailer for the programme i thought it was an advert for some sun-screen product with all the people walking around on the beach despite this i decided to watch it thinking it would be some new show i could laugh at but i was seriously the first seconds of the program i was hooked why is he lying in the trees why did the plane crash etc not everyday that a show comes along which combines intelligence humour action and suspense but lost manages all of this with a great cast and crew beautiful locations and pretty decent special effects lost will catch anyone who tunes in and is a must see for anyone sick of cheesy sitcoms and crappy reality is on tuesdays at on channel
clint eastwood returns as dirty harry calahan in the movie of the dirty harry series clint is older but still got it harry was told to have a vacation after some trouble that happened because of a robbery the memorable make my day catchphrase comes from but the city he took a vacation was worse a woman turned vigilante after a rape attack in a funfair and starts getting the punks one by one the last movie to see sandra locke in a clint eastwood movie an improvement after the enforcer which was a bit more of a comedy and less serious clint sunglasses were gargoyles which are best known for the sunglasses that are worn by arnold shwartzeneger in the terminator worth a watch if you like clint eastwood the dirty harry films or like action crime thrillers
the film gets my stamp of approval the scene in the museum demands acting without dialogue this is one of the most interesting and unique scenes in the history of film character kate is very well developed and her performance is felt throughout the entire film the best work angie dickinson did since point blank
a top notch columbo from beginning to end i particularly like the interaction between columbo and the killer ruth an avid columbo fan i can't recall another one in which he doesn't set up the killer at the end as he does in other episodes in this one as trying to determine the correct sequence of the boxes and the message that the nephew left behind it finally dawns on music in this episode is very good as well as it is in many of other ones
this movie was excellent it details the struggle between a committed detective against the dedicated ignorance of the corrupted communist regime in russia during the i give this movie high marks for no-holds-barred look into the birth and development of forensic investigation in a globally isolated to the regime community this is a graphic movie it presents an unsensationalized picture of violence and tragic remains nothing is candy-coated with overdone blood or gore to separate us from the cruel reality on the screen this movie is based on russian serial killer andrei chikatilo i'm familiar enough with the true story to have a very deep appreciation for how real they kept the film not a comedy but for those who appreciate dry and dark humor this movie is a must-see
the choice to make this snl skit into a movie was far better thought out than other recent ones the humor involved in the character is not annoyance humor and is also character driven enough to be stretched out for an hour or enough the sexual content seemed like it could be avoided but that may have been because the constraints of live television schooled me to not expect it i suppose i was thinking more leisure suit larry risqué than the producers not a movie which will probably hurt it from ever reaching the heights of its more successful predecessors but still better premise and writing than its more dismal liked it but i doubt it will be a smash hit is sad as tim meadows tends not to do characters that annoy me with quite the frequency other snl alumni tend to
this is one of my all time the movie has a flaw that it comes at you like a raging bull it doesn't so much engage the viewer as assault him scarface is as voracious and unyielding a production as tony montana himself nothing is left to the languorous synthpop fits the action to a tee like the chorus in a greek tragedy it wails and gnashes broods and tugs a constant reminder of inexorable so much a tale of caution as a disaster in progress scarface rips across the screen with the unstoppable force of a runaway train
okay this movie fine like i said but you surely need to watch it as its worth a watch about two boys mac and sam who are great friends and work as fashion photographers and the laughing time starts when mac akshay kumar starts dating with air hostesses at the same time leaving his wife suspicious sam attains fortune and almost forgets his friend but not completely but mac thinks so and so he starts dating with air hostesses garam masala at every step of the movie songs rock but somethings lacking the not up to the mark and deserves an award its nice but not all that excellent some people laughed till their stomaches ached but it didn't deserve that many laughs but of course opinion is different so if you wanna watch the movie you're welcome to do so
i thought that this film was very well made heath leger was very convincing and his irish accent was flawless orlando bloom and naomi watts were also really good and believable how true it is to what really happened i have no idea but it did portray why people sometimes become what they do maybe those in authority have always been corrupt and i did find it interesting that over signed a petition for ned kelly not to be hanged so maybe there was more truth in this film than at first thought in many ways it reminded me of cold mountain which was another good historical film all in all i would highly recommend this film and i am somewhat baffled why it didn't do better in the cinemas
this flick is sterling example of the state of erotic b-movies bad porn movies without the hardcore sex the plot in this one isn't so bad as these things go it involves a female lawyer trying to prove her lover is innocent of killing his wife the rest of the movie however leaves something to be desired bad acting bad direction bad looking woman bad sets bad cinematography bad sound and bad sex scenes the filmmakers should learn the difference between raunchy and erotic they don't even have the common sense to have gabriella hall naked or in a love how dumb is that
i have bought the dvd of this version to compare against the current bbc version is brilliant the was adapted by arthur hopcraft who adapted tinker tailor soldier spy for tv and who died this year i remember great acting especially from rigg and elliott and moving music in the version is far more understated but very telling just to pick up other commentators on a couple of points richard carstone is ada boyfriend not esther had no uncle charlie drake never played krook in either version nor did he play toby esterhase in ttss krook is played by comedian johnny vegas in the version toby was played by bernard versions are honourable and admirable adaptations of dickens great novel now read the book not perfect and the sentimentality may make you wince at times but i defy you not to cry and laugh
i had never heard of this flick despite the connection to george clooney company produced and he appears in a very funny supporting bit and his director steven soderbergh worse we picked this up in a discount bin for dollars at that what a grand and pleasant surprise but then i'm of the opinion that if william h macy is in it you can't be disappointed this was very reminiscent of those ealing comedies from england in the ok with more profanity this is an oddball and at times gut-splittingly funny film the actual heist made me laugh so hard i was crying perhaps the funniest use of underpants in movie history maybe it was the low expectations i had going in but i watched with a group of people and we had a blast best i've spent in ages
dark angel is a futuristic sci-fi series set in post-apocalyptic seattle centering on max alba a genetically enhanced young woman on the run from her dark angel universe is absorbing as much as say buffy but absorbing nonetheless with an interesting and believable set of characters certainly it is not for everyone but those who give it time will find themselves watching one of the most enjoyable series out there dark angel is criminally overlooked and under-rated and was unfortunatly canceled after only series which was a great shame as this had the potential to become a great series although its episodes are only shy of long running bbc sci-fi comedy red dwarf as it is dark angel remains unfinished so seek it out and if you want more lobby fox to make another series
this is by far one of the better made movies and didn't leave me disappointed at all the sound track along with finely shot hand-held camera work was exquisite the are always chances a movie won't hold ones beliefs as well as another but i felt that rhythm of this picture and the timing was excellent dakota fanning is rapidly becoming a staple in movie that require a child with an old soul personality and she has never disappointed me with her talent as for mr washington and of course christopher walken they both exceed the challenge of showing the darkest sides of humanity trying to move to the light
if you haven't already seen this movie of mary-kate and then all i can say is what are you waiting for this is yet another terrific and wonderful movie by the fraternal twins that we all know and love so much fun romantic exciting and absolutely breath-taking of course as always mary-kate and ashley are the main scenery here anyway would any true fan want it any other way of course not anyway a great movie in every sense of the word so if you haven't already seen it then you just have to now i mean right now too so what are you waiting for i promise that you won't be disappointed sincerely rick morris
i first saw this film when i was flipping through the movie channels on my parents directv it was on the sundance channel and was just starting i love music especially late and this is what the bjm sounded like dandys are alright everything about the brian jonestown massacre intrigued me from the music to anton and personalities to the illicit drug use it was funny because as i was watching the first party scene when everyone is doing lines my parents walked by and decided to watch look on their faces were priceless anyways this is definitely one of my favorite movies because it introduced me to the brian jonestown massacre who is now my favorite band of all watch it seriously
richard beautifully directed mixture of youthful romance and paris travelogue is one of the best thinking romantic movies julie delpy turns in one of the most engaging performances as the parisian lass who spends a day with stranger-on-a-train ethan hawke the dialogue there is oodles of it is sometimes meandering and overly precious but this portrait of two young wannabe-lovers making a romantic intellectual and spiritual connection to one another is full of wonderfully amusing touching and insightful moments
one woman by herself in a house for of screen time doesn't sound like a formula to hold you on the edge-of-your-seat but future shock is truly as thrilling as they come writer star vivian schilling takes on those little fears we all suppress and enlarges them to terrifying proportions so don't watch this film alone
i swear that zombie was killed like twice and kept coming back i gave this movie an face it folks this is exactly what the other reviewers are saying a handy-cam shot film hey hey hey welcome to total indy film making the fact that todd sheets got over zombies to appear in this movie is a tribute to his talents yes the story has gaps yes we see the same zombies over and over again but who really cares take it for what it is a fun and gory horror film one to share with your buds or to gross out the people you really care about lol mellow out people i suppose you all liked hunks of garbage like titanic or twister instead peace and support independent film making
i've just finished listening to the commentary for this film and i think the one big thing i got from it that i agree with is that this film like the insider is completely subjective from pov so any review or attempt at contemplating a set of comments about it as ebert did is really about character actually if you feel as he did that the film does not work then you're saying i think that howard does not work and to be frank you might be right reasoning and personality really wouldn't stand up to professional mental treatments and hey the nature of

this is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen if you know the real world and the people from those shows this movie will be top notch if you have never seen the real world you will still think it is an extremely funny movie but you won't get some of the inside jokes about the actors and the tv show
i dont know why people think this is such a bad movie its got a pretty good plot some good action and the change of location for harry does not hurt either sure some of its offensive and gratuitous but this is not the only movie like that eastwood is in good form as dirty harry and i liked pat hingle in this movie as the small town cop if you liked dirty harry then you should see this one its a lot better than the dead pool
i went into this movie knowing nothing about it and ended up really enjoying it it lacked authenticity and some of the things that the characters said and did were completely bizarre and a lot of the script seemed like it was ad-libbed this is typical of woody allen excuse my ignorance but the whole audience in the theater was laughing so hard it wasn't even at the jokes in the movie per se but at the whole movie itself the acting reminded me of acting where he tries not to laugh at his own they are corny but if you don't take the movie too seriously you can really appreciate the humour of the actors not the characters if you're looking for a random movie and you like woody allen i'd definitely recommend it
i loved this movie chris showerman did an amazing job not only is he an incredible actor but he is gorgeous with an awesome physique he did a great job on the delivery of his lines plus transformed into george better than fraser did a great performance for his first major roll this movie is full of hilarious scenes that every child will love my kids have watched this movie numerous times since we purchased the dvd the day it came out in addition to the movie the extras on the dvd are just as hilarious two thumbs up on this one i highly recommend it to everyone
a haunting piece that the discerning horror film fan will fall upon with gratitude keep your freddys and your jasons this film is in the same company as the haunting original lyrical and truthful it stays with you long into the night much like those terrifying cbs radio mystery theatre shows a smart rent
i thought the movie was extremely funny and actually very interesting it was raw and honest and felt as if i was really watching the real people not actors great entertainment it also painted the people as human on our level not below us it is a very good film
capitães de abril is a very good the story isn't a documentary about the revolution in portugal but it gives us an idea of how it was like the fiction of the story isn't of great interest but it doesn't spoil the movie the heroic actions of captain salgueiro maia aren't exaggerations and the film is also a tribute for his deeds captain salgueiro maia remains one of the greatest heroes of the of april the actors are very good and even the smallest roles are played wonderfully lisbon looks beautiful as ever don't miss it i liked this film very much
out of this brilliant super documentary is a must see with film clips from the war which people did not seen for years untill this was screened in the film clips in this documentary from the war doesn't miss out anything some of the clips left me dumbstuck the whole series is over episodes long and sir lawrence olivier is the narrator and tells a stunning story of war simply this is still probably the best documentary of war still and now over years old still is able to pack a tremendous punch you must watch this at some time even if a few episodes even at that you will still be blown away at the impact this documentary means to those who have been there suffered and died in the name of war in a world at war
very good drama about a young girl who attempts to unravel a series of horrible crimes she enlists the aid of a police cadet and they begin running down a series of clues which lead to a traveling carny worker with a long police record an ending which is guaranteed to keep you on the edge of your seat
this movie is not schlock despite the lo fi production and its link to troma productions a dark fable for adults exploitation is a theme of sugar cookies and one wonders if the cast has not fallen prey to said theme a weird movie with enticing visuals shadows and contrast are prominent definitely worth a look especially from fans of warhol and stylish decadence through all the cruelty and wickedness a moral albeit twisted can be gleamed
i liked this movie very much although this movie doesn't boast of big even known names its very charming its one of those feel good types where you know that everythings gonna be just fine in the end my favorite scene is with the baby elephant part i rate this movie at
cut a long story short i loved every minute of it a lavish fantasy in true arabian-nights style an evil magician a pretty princess a djinn and everybody lives happily ever after modern hollywoond sure does have one or two things to learn from this classic only quibble the special effects are pretty dated sabu with the foot though
easy to make really general comments about a film like this the fact that one of the only remaining japanese films from this era causes people to say that it started japanese cinema and was unlike anything the west ever made the latter of these two comments is particularly false as kinugasa himself admitted to ripping off caligari on more than one occasion but style was meant to be imitated and doesn't take away from this importance what we have here is experimental themes and composition built on already established visual styles opening the doors for a truly brilliant layering of narratives and realities for this purpose the madhouse is the ideal setting and the writers knew this this is a landmark film and every effort should be made to track it out of essential
i bought dark angel seasons two weeks ago after catching a couple of season episodes on channel nothing prepared me for how brilliant the show is i haven't enjoyed anything as much since firefly and amazing show i'll admit season wqasn't quite as good but there are still some amazing episodes designate this bag em the berrisford agenda harbor lights freak nation etc and alec is great i've heard some of the plans for the would-be season and i have to say i can't believe it was cancelled i won't spoil it for you but it would have rocked i also think it has a lot of potential as a movie at the moment it seems highly unlikely as proof of my obsessiveness barcode number is and in the two weeks i've had it i am episodes away from having watched both seasons twice just too good
difficult film to comment on how do you say bad well it isn't but then equally difficult to say it is good what it is is compelling viewing it is as close as you will get to utter devastation without being there it is the photographs of the tsunami approaching the coast of thailand brought to life you know you want to turn away but you have to naudet brothers handle the commentary very well even in the most tragic of circumstances there view on something which is happening in another country neither panders nor insults the facts are on the cellulose and little is needed for the viewer to understand or comprehend what is going can't change history and you should not want this film stands as a testament to humanity in its darkest hour
this is the only david zucker movie that does not spoof anything the first of its kind the funniest movie of with night at the roxbury right behind but i did not think theres something about mary was funny so that doesnt count except for the frank and beans thing he he dont listen to the critics especially roger ebert he does not know solid entertainment just look at his see it you wont be dissapionted
i watched this movie every chance i got back in the seventies when it came out on cable it was my introduction to harlem which has fascinated me bill clinton ever since i was still very young and the movie made a big impression on me it was great to see a movie about other young girls growing up trying to decide whom they wanted to be and making some bad choices as well as good ones i was dazzled by lonette beauty the great dresses they eventually got to wear and the snappy dialogue as someone being raised by a single mother as well i could really identify with these girls and their lives funny these characters seem almost more real to me than beyonce knowles
lily powers works at a speakeasy until her father then goes to new york to work at an office she notices that if she wants to get any higher she has to give the men what they what men want is you baby face is a movie of high sexual a movie of that era was one of the last pre-code films that were stanwyck gives a very sexy performance as actors of this film include george brent trenholm donald cook stevens alphonse ethier cragg henry kolker margaret lindsay carter and theresa harris young john wayne is seen as jimmy mccoy movie deals with a brave topic and it does it face is historically significant movie and therefore good to watch
i love this episode of columbo maybe because ruth gordon is in it and she is wonderful as successful mystery writer abigail mitchell an american version of dame agatha christie she is delicious to watch as the perky lovable author who suffered a terrible loss when her niece died in a drowning accident she blames her husband the nephew she plans to kill him to avenge her death since the police have abandoned her i would have loved somebody else than mariette hartley to play veronica i never really like hartley in anything personally and of course with columbo there are some laughs like when he questions veronica at a belly-dancing class abigail is a smart sleuth herself and she matches wits with columbo always played wonderfully by peter falk
my short comment for this flick is go pick it up chances are you are going to be positively surprised by a diversity of elements superbly explored in this criminal thriller there is no way the character of miklos claiming and pushing for room in every way possible wont push your nerves to the thumbs up
shall we dance is an excellent film because it shows how something like dancing can rejuvenate the life flow in the human is seen as the expression of existence and the birth of individuality the is certainly the case with aoki at work he is a humble office denizen but place him on the dance floor and all his bottled up intensity is released surprisingly this release is frowned upon in japan due to the rigid culture of conformity at the start of the film all the characters are ashamed or frightened of their desire to dance they will be scorned or deemed perverted for expressing their passion through film is well worth watching to witness the rebirth of human emotions and passions it will leave a smile on your face for days
i'll be honest with liked this movie a great zombie flick that is packed with action original ideas good acting but is also packed with bad zombie effects part iv entitled after death is also good i would recommend this movie to horror fans out of of horror movies like this should check out puppet master skinned alive slumber party massacre sleep away camp and other full moon pictures flicks for other recommendations check out the other comments i have sent in by clicking on my name above this comment section
this is another great movie i had the good fortune to see for the first time on the big screen to rick baker et al back in the late i was a relative newcomer to the genre and only really new about the big three jc sh yb i wasn't sure what to expect when i payed my hard earned money to see this in a triple bill of classics at the old scala i need not have worried i was left breathless by this movie if you're a fan of hong kong action kung fu movies and haven't seen this movie do so now
i really in enjoyed watching this movie like most of the people that watched it i wasn't sure that i was getting whoopi goldberg is a very funny comedian and she has done a lot of funny movies sister this was not really comedy it is a drama with comedic moments so if your looking for a laugh riot then keep movie is about a black family moving up from a nice neighborhood in the city to an upper middle class neighborhood i would say more but it think it would spoil the movie this movie does not just deal with race relations between whites and blacks but also about relations with in the black community i do think that it is worth a chance if your not really interested in see another movie about race relations then this movie isn't for you
rated e never actually owned a nintendo but i have played one many my opinion along with conkers bad fur day super mario is one of the best video games for the nintendo have played this game plenty of times and its good every you have an and don't have this game you should try to find original super mario bros games were side scrolling video games but super mario has a mario in a nice game is sort of weird but there is plenty of things you can do in the play as super mario and once again you must rescue princess and the power stars from you can do it in a mario is a very fun and good game and i recommend
i love tudor chirila and maybe why i enjoyed the movie so much two days before the movie premiere i went to see his concert i saw the trailer and the video zmeu before the movie and i thought i had it all figured i was wrong instead of a good movie i assisted a great one i felt the movie it was sad it was funny but most of all it pictured love i can't even begin to describe the soundtrack so i won't i'm not a movie critic i can't describe it in more words my kinda vague description is all because the play left me speechless thank god for the keyboard thank you tudor giurgiu thank you maria popistasu thank you ioana barbu and thank you tudor chirila encore
i remember watching this is its original airing in as a five or six year old and really enjoying this i recently had the opportunity to watch it again for the first time since then as it was aired on walt disney presents on the disney channel i'd forgotten most of it and some of it was geared towards kids but it was still enjoyable i can't wait to show it to my niece and nephews
anne brontes epic novel the tenant of wildfell hall should be studied and read throughout schools and libraries and peoples living rooms its a fantastic story and tells the real truth on alcoholism and ruined marriages and a mothers fight to keep her son away from her brutal husband its so alike todays stories that we see and hear and i believe people can learn a lot from reading this book based on possible true experiences that the author had back in the watch this film its a great version of the book and very moving indeed i'm sure anne herself would have been happy with the way it was acting and great locations
this entire movie is worth watching just for the magnificent final moment its the best ending of any movie i've ever seen perfect beautiful funny simply found this movie delightful even with french taking-itself-too-seriously deep meanings thing going on i loved it a great love story and i loved the way algerians were woven in and by the way the music during the final credits is great i want the cd
and i am a nicole kidman fanatic i would pay to see and hear her read the moscow phone book which for all i know she may have been doing when she was speaking russian in this movie four of the principals are excellent but the movie itself is a number of good images and better scenes held together by one is always ready to suspend disbelief while watching a movie this one asks too much of the viewer could have been very funny it is in parts or quite frightening it is in one scene but the director didn't seem to know which way to go
tho years old groove tube looks a lot like actual tv today specialty niche networks sports a tv show about stoner drug dealers called the dealers weeds and even predating cheech chong up in smoke weird beer commercials beer no less bizarre than bud bowls dirty-minded clown koko of pee wee herman even chevy chase doing slapstick humor violent barbershop vocal duo a year before his debut on saturday night live and thanks to the infamous opening sequence that earned groove tube an initial x-rating i still can't hear curtis move on up without thinking of naked dancing hitchhiking hippies for similar sketch-style movies see tunnelvision kentucky fried movie amazon women on the mood monty beyond the fringe dynamite chicken and the firesign everything you know is wrong
what can i say about this film that hasnt already been said well to tell the truth alot of it looks very fake like some of the slaps and the kicks how charlie sheen though this was real i dont know im sure they would be hitting and kicking her alot harder if it was however the scenes with the pinching and the hot oil look very real and the final needle in the eye scene is amazingly done and is probibly the only thing on film that has ever shocked me
this movie is awesome sort of it dosent really say much or do much but it is an awesome movie to watch because of how stupid it is the high school is taken over by evil that hates the one thing that all the students love roll riff randle get everyone tickets for the ramones show and this movie peaks with a take over of the school led my riff randle the ramones this movie has everything a bad script questionable directing bad clint howard soles an awesome campyness these elements much more come together to make this what it during the live ramones set notice that darby crash of the germs is in the front of the crowd neat-o
i watched lion king more times that all my friends put togther having a baby sister you know how it is by now i memorized both the plot and the lines after lion king came out i was like ok well let me see the second one was significantly weaker then i saw an ad for lion king and i was like ok there we go again after watching the i was like wow all my expectations repetitevness were broken a truly lovely and original plot keeps you glued to your seat for the entire time i have noticed that the cartoon was filled with so many comical moments that roflmao will apply here definetly recommend seeing the cartoon
paradise is a combination of neo-shaw brothers action and ringo urban cynicism when one watches the film they might feel the fight scenes are only mediocre in nature but that doesn't matter attitude and atmosphere that counts this great film has both always trying to be different than his contemporaries lam gives us to traditional sai-yuk and hung puts them in a raiders of the lost ark setting however these are not the light-hearted comedic incarnations that you might see in a jet li movie instead these guys fight to the death with brutal results what makes the film even better is that anyone could die at anytime there is no holding back too bad they don't make films like this more often
hlots was an outstanding series its what nypd blue will never be on hlots the plots are real the dialog is real the relationships are real with hlots back as a movie tying up all the loose ends it was good to have all the gang back together even a few that passed away show up say how the storyline was fast paced emotional and full of the spirit the series had week in and week out homicide life on the streets network drama at its best stars thumbs up and all that thanks nbc for giving us the finally we didn't get
i gave this a out of points i love it so much i am a child of the and totally into heavy metal for many years those are the reasons i like this movie so much its so cool to see those posters in the bedroom of that boy priest lizzy borden raven twisted his vinyl the wicked by exciter rise of the mutants by shock metal master impaler and killing is my business by megadeth also the soundtrack by fastway is totally incredible and fits very well with the plot if you are into metal then trick or treat is your friend don't buy or watch this movie for ozzy or gene simmons because they are in the movie for seconds watch it because the soundtrack and the story that will take you back to the glory you will not be the same person after
watching midnight cowboy is like taking a masterclass in writing i was too young to watch it when it was originally released and only saw it for the first time a couple of years ago but it has absolutely stood the test of time and i have watched it several times since about this film is brilliant from the poignant performances from voight and hoffman though i know this movie well i still find myself welling up every time voight flashes one of his innocently pained looks or hoffman coughs in his sickly and ominous way to the stunning cinematography and superbly edited dream sequences a shame that more of our contemporary filmmakers aren't prepared to take a risk on making movies that are as visually and aurally interesting as this one midnight cowboy should be required viewing at all film schools
i can't remember many details about the show but i remember how passionate i was about it and how i was determined not to miss any episodes unfortunately at the time we had no vcr so i haven't ever seen the series again however i can remember strongly how i felt while watching it and how thrilled i was every time it came on sam waterstone was my favorite actor these days think i was almost in love and he remains one of my favorite actors to the day mostly due to his appearance in the series i would gladly this series i think i would go to great lengths in order to see it again and revisit a childhood long gone any ideas does anybody knows of a site devoted to the series or has the episodes on tape from their first airing
soldier may not have academy acting or lucas special effects but it definitely does it for me i won't tell you what its about i'm sure you already read the summary this is a great doomed futureistic fiction movie kurt russell doesn't say much he usually has an eerie or drone look on his face but it fits the character there are great action and fight scenes some of the scenes are unrealistic but thats hollywood make believe land that we should have to escape our normal lives i have not seen soldier but this one it one of my favorites i'm lucky enough to have a wife that digs on guy movies we both love this movie and recommend it to anyone who likes tough movies
first of all that i would like to say is that edison chen is extremely hot and that sam lee is looking much better than before xd this is probably one of the most original movies i have seen so far shows a poverty lifestyle background of a cambodian the aka pang goes around killing people to survive himself has done it throughout his entire life sam duty is to capture the cambodian for good there are tons of violent actions but has a good story to it the movie shows the struggles between those two characters they both beat each other like angry dogs go and watch suggessted hk films
todd rohal is a mad genius knuckleface jones his third and most fully realized short film has an offbeat sense of humor and will leave some scratching their heads what the film is about at heart and he would almost certainly disagree with me on this is how a regular joe finds the confidence to get through life with a little inspiration or not you just have to see for yourself the short is intermittently making rounds on the festival circuit so keep your eyes peeled and catch it if you can you'll be glad you did it is hilarious and check out other short films also popping up here and there from time to time single spaced and slug

absolutely hilarious john waters tribute to the people he loves most is a twisted little ditty with plenty to look at and laugh at like being turned loose in a museum of kitsch i haven't laughed so much in a theater since serial mom i loved seeing old friends from the dreamland days sharon nisep and susan lowe back in front of waters camera the cast is simply wonderful edward furlong and martha plimpton uses the best elements of past waters atrocities the underrated polyester and plenty of new surprises made me sick in a wonderful way thanks john
i had no problem with the film which i thought was pretty good the actual lapd crime scene video that disturbed me i wonder if gate really thought that the general viewing audience would want to see people that were brutally beaten to death and blood all over the place sorry gate this was an incredibly bad back to the film the cast was excellent especially val kilmer as the late john holmes john holmes was a sleaze mistreats the women in his life kudrow as his wife kate bosworth as his he is hopelessly deep into drugs his connection to eddie nash a spiral that resulted in the infamous wonderland murders exactly how much was holmes involved in the murders we may never know the entire truth to the is still alive and a free the film does a pretty good job nonetheless
this was a top-notch movie with a top-notch cast danny glover tony danza joseph gordon-levitt and especially christopher lloyed are well-cast in this charming movie about real-life angels helping the angels baseball team you never know it could happen i loved role in it he was hilarious the story is about turning your life around as the belief in angels helped turn around angry hardened and embittered manager glover see the best in people the movie was well made and also about seeing the best in people and reaching your dreams it was funny charming touching and sad all very nicely done you will like love it i out of
i rented this movie and watched it times before i took it back to the store bill paxton hired some first rate talent to make a good thriller with some interesting twists the story is original and well written powers booth and paxton both deliver good performances the story is told in an interesting manner with both flashbacks years back then spots in the present alternating back and forth this style of storytelling makes for a good thriller that can't get dull bill paxton please make more horror movies you have the talent for it
since educating rita julie walters has been one of my role models and her performance in this as a woman who helps the man she loves get in synch with his feminine side is magnificent i would never have believed her character in the hands of a lesser actress but walters pulls it off with gusto and panache adrian pasdar gives his best performance to-date in the male lead
this movie was so great i am a teenager and i and my friends all love the series so it just goes to show that these movies draw attention to all age crowds i recommend it to everyone my favorite line in this movie is when logan bartholomew says rosy cheeks when he is talking about his baby daughter he is such a great actor as well as erin cottrell they pair up so well and have such a great chemistry i really hope that they can work again together they are such attractive people and are very good actors i have finally found movies that are good to watch lately it has been hard for me to find movies that are good and show good morals and christian values but at the same time these movies aren't cheesy
while many unfortunately passed on the ballroom scene is still very much alive and carrying on their legacy some are still very much alive and quite well octavia is more radiant and beautiful than ever willi ninja is very accomplished and gives a great deal of support to the gay community as a whole pepper labeija just passed on last year of natural cause may she rest in peace after passing carmen became the mother of the house of xtravaganza was in the beach scene and she is looking more and more lovely as well some balls have categories dedicated to those who have passed may they all rest in peace there is currently another project underway known as how do i look you can check out the website at
homicide the movie proved to be a good wrap-up to a well-written well-directed and well-acted series loose ends were tied up that weren't properly addressed at the end of the final season the entire series and especially the movie provided a life-like look at life death in baltimore a culturally unique city with an extremely high murder rate my attraction to the series began long before i moved to baltimore but once i experienced life here for myself i realized how realistic it was and the movie certainly retained that spirit i will certainly miss new original episodes of the series but am very grateful to nbc and the producers and cast for giving us one last glimpse at the dark side of charm city
this one is quite a nice surprise cute little story of the quest very surprising metamorphosis of the four-eye prissy soon-to-be-spinster type into a raunchy dd-cup sex queen a sight for sore eyes not only for two quite stunning actresses but also for of the costumes and make-up of the actors an unnecessary bit of cheapness came in some ridiculous castle to the positives the movie is spiced with some unusually explicit camera-shots which you would not expect in a soft core loved that scene with the icicles absolute classics potential a slight minus only for few odd scenes where bad acting by minor casts shortly suspended the suspension of disbelief including an extra credit for the serious drooling effect
this is an excellent example of what can be done on a small budget movie the acting is excellent considering the script the whole atmosphere of the film is very foreboding the gore is well done and used sparingly out for the excellent barbed-wire death the action is punchy when used true that there are dodgy lines in the script at times but compared to other movies on the same bigger budget hardly noticeable at all overall this is recommended trust me better than it appears
ride with the devil directed by ang tiger is another gem in this fine directors cap for those unfamiliar with the history of the kansas-missouri border wars during the american civil war see this film you will visit a sad piece of americana besides some superb action scenes bloody at times this is a story of love devotion between men one lady in particular it stars toby maguire skeet ulrich jeffrey wright as the young lady jewel i never heard or seen her before i want to see more of acting is top notch superb production values very well written from a this is a long film minutes but well worth my rating is respectively
this was one of my favorite series when i was a kid the swedish broadcasting company decided to broadcast it once again a couple of summers ago when i had just finished my first semester of medical school i was surprised to see the depth in which the organs was explained sure some things are simplified but most of it was correct though it was made years ago and quite understandable i would suggest that all soon-to-be medical student should watch it it is a very good way to learn some of the basic medical words for example now i'm in my semester and i think i'll watch the series once again as soon as i've bought the dvd-box
my mom and i have just recently become addicted to this show laughing our butts off i've only seen about episodes and i am disappointed that i didn't pay attention to this hilarious series before they were canceled the story line is very funny the characters really have great personalities not so great but they're still funny i tivo every episode of what i like about you amanda bynes and jennie garth as well as all of the cast never leave me bored while watching there is some unsuitable language for children and some sexual content but with a parental guide near you shouldn't have too much problems there is some sort of friends type of relationship that attracts me to this show i really enjoy it
this movie is incredibly realistic and i feel does a great justice to the crime that many people do not understand because of a lack of experience the many people who think they could fathom what goes through a mind are arrogant as a victim i feel that dawson did a fantastic job in her role of maya i agree that this is an incredibly brave film this looks at rape from a different more realistic standpoint than any other movie i've ever seen on the subject the end did drag on a bit long but i know that many victims imagine this kind of justice since the chances of an attacker being sent to jail for their crime is around good to see a movie that sticks closer to reality than most would dare to
im a huge m lillard fan why i ended up watching this movie honestly i doubt that if he wasn't in the movie i would of enjoyed it as much or even watched it but once i did watch it realize the story was pretty decent a bad ending i must say but i did see it coming a low budget movie and some of the actors weren't really good but all in all i rated this movie suspense of wondering what lillard was actually up to was what really keeped me interested in this a good
this movie is actually funny if you'd like to rest your brain for an hour so then go ahead and watch it called blonde and blonder so don't expect profound and meaningful jokes what this movie and enjoy all the stereotypes we have about two blondes just a funny movie to watch on a date or with a company of friends if you're not too sober lol pamela and denise are still pretty hot chicks a mistake to judge this movie as a piece of art c'mon this movie is about blondes supposed to be light funny and superficial one more thing i do not think that girls will appreciate and like this movie but guy definitely will
to me the final scene in which harris responds to the press corp is worthy of viewing this intelligent and timeless slice of the campaign phase if only the real-life pols would respond in the intelligent articulate manner as did mr the arrogant self-serving members of the press would perhaps think twice before surfacing irrelevant confrontational garbage that has absolutely nothing to do with a candidates abilities to effectively handle the challenges of the office for which is pursuing
the title says it not a film critic nor will i act like the rest of the snobbish people commenting on this this movie didn't have a multi-million dollar budget but the plot was very well done the acting was awesome and the cinematography was great it looked like you all had a lot of fun making this movie i voted out of as the sound was strong on only one channel instead of both but i imagine this might have been an error in the recording of the definitely be checking out other movies produced by brain damage films o'leary cast and crew i thank you
delirious near plot-less mood piece and if more lsd inspired than the devil then we must remember when it was made after a startling sm opening even itself is not what it seems we move to soft focus and dream or imaginings or remembering lots of literary and cinematic references and indeed this is the franco film that lang himself praised beautiful and mesmerising the film unfolds at a leisurely pace but has a richness within each fold a rare movie to languish within old jess could make em when he tried fine central performances too including the indomitable jack taylor and howard vernon i haven't even mentioned the lisbon locations ah
i just can't believe that these games can get so much better but they do unfortunately i had to rent a dreamcast to play it but even though i did beat it i can't wait to buy it for this is the only series of games that i must own all of them even if i have beaten them many times over i hope they never stop making this type of game even if the series must come to an
i am not a usual commenter on this website but seeing how underrated this movie is i endeavour myself to write some comments and remarks about it i had fun watching this movie perhaps because cat is everything i wish i could be i am not going to post spoilers or reveal plots but are things that i really found amazing the way she manipulates people just so divine this is a very underrated movie i lack of arguments here i usually go enjoy and then speak little about it when you go to the movies is to have fun and i really enjoyed the i stayed in the dark room a must seen over and over again until the delight fades away try not be so critical about it thank you for reading
this was incredible meaning that it was hard to believe that the forgotten tribe would make this astounding migration twice a year and that the filmmakers cooper and schoedsack didn't stage some of the scenes and shots but what shots they are the cinematography under mostly extreme conditions is brilliant and the score of iranian music added to the video release give this memorable documentary an added had the pleasure of seeing this and kon tiki on the same weekend which was a thrill and certainly made me see how tough and hardy and brave people can be whether for primitive survival or the need for adventure or in the name of science
bottom line best romantic comedy ever this movie accomplishes what all great movies strive for the creation of a world and time that we want to re-visit and makes us glad to be part of the human race when i am blue this movie lifts my spirit and makes me laugh that is still true after many viewings always of the actors are in top form the characterizations are so dead on and the characters mesh so well together that you forget the actor difficult to do with matthau robbins and ryan the supporting cast is consistently brilliant fry a total pygmy package jacoby saks maher three theoretical physicists as greek chorus but time doesn't exist durning we can launch from nj shalhoub whaley boss and co-worker at the service station and curits how many comedies have miss this overlooked treasure
hello dave burning paradise is a film for anyone who likes jackie chan and indiana jones the films main protagonist is most definitely the bastard son of these two strange fathers as for the other characters well they are familiar transformations of similar action film stereotypes where this film is original is in the blending of the traditional hong kong movie style with the hollywood action adventure sadly this has not been true of the films he has made in hollywood
i saw this movie when i was a little girl and i have enjoyed it every time sure the graphics are a little cheesy compared to now but back in the it was great i saw it in the original spanish version only and thought it was wonderful that was how i remember my christmases were with my family magical santa claus was amazing and i couldn't wait for him to come back each you have a and speak spanish bring them up watching this old fashioned version of santa claus a different version than we are used to today but who says there is one a fun movie to watch it teaches children good vs bad i don't know how the english subtitled version is or if there is an english one of this but the spanish is the best enjoy and happy holidays feliz navidad
now my friends films like la bête the beast or o can be done in the old continent in this film we see all horses dirty sex nymphomaniac kind off gorilla non sense dialogs etc etc etc in the serious terms an allegory that men sometimes could be bestial visceral and borowczyk director shows us the loss of innocence sexual violence rape and brutality its a astonishing cinematic experience bizarre and full of grotesque scenes for all fans of european shocking exploitation i recommend this you like this one i recommend orloff against the invisible man and alterated states
i agree whole-heartedly with the comments so far i remember this documentary as being one of the most amazing and informative i've ever seen as stated before i recall that i began watching thinking it was just another nature study interesting not necessarily special but i was so wrong not only was the story of the colony incredible but i remember the music as being so much a part of appeal if i remember correctly it was native americn pipes to the music at the end of one flew over the nest i too have been looking for a copy this should be required watching for anybody but especially the schools it should be re-released
i used to watch this show when i was a little girl although i don't remember much about it i must say that it was a pretty good show also i don't think i've seen every episode however if you ask me it was still a good show i vaguely remember the theme song everyone was ideally cast the costume design was great the performances were top-grade too i just hope some network brings this series back one day so that i'll be able to see every episode before i wrap this up i'd like to say that i'll always remember this show in my memory forever even though i don't think i've seen every episode now in conclusion when and if this show is ever brought back on the air i hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good
the performances in this movie were fantastic the dialogue was great jason patric delivered a fantastic performance as kid collins in this wonderful adaptation of the jim thompson novel far superior to the grifters which was a good movie this film really stayed true to the pulp noir roots from which the story came i recommend this movie to all film noir fans
the part where meg visits the mechanic and he says is the piston firing short poor sexual energy on the part of her fiancée was hilarious i love meg ryan and she is as sweet as ever in this wonderful movie very lovable and very intelligent too her innocent indignant expressions have you wishing she was yours the hero handles the garage mechanic to physicist transformation well einstein had a romantic side to his psyche the puzzle round in front of the press and audience was done well awfully underrated and deserves accolades and attempts at a revival it loses out one vote for including the highly improbable far fetched theory being bought by the us govt i don't see why it doesn't figure in the top romantic comedies of the century great movie it has the presidential seal of approval on it
class reunion is a very underated comedy gem and the class of lizzie borden high return for there year reunion among them are the usual stereotypes the hunk babe the fat guy nerd etc but the former students are in for a bumpy night one of their classmates is walter baloer the class wimp who was subject to a comedy prank by the rest of the class on graduation night and since then has been in a mental home walter escapes and now plans to avenge his the dark premise this is really just an excuse for lots of very funny gags set pieces to say too much more would spoil the film but if you enjoyed the naked gun airplane movies you'll love this what other film offers a music cameo by chuck berry a great comedy which deserves a wider audience
this in my opinion is one of the best action movies of the it not only features a great cast but is also loaded with wild shootouts and explosions that are still impressive today the story is about a vietnam vet kristofferson being recruited by his brother vincent to help clean up the criminal element in a small town and what happens when kris starts taking advantage of his position and becomes as bad as the criminals he was hired to get rid of great seeing kris play against type bernadette peeters and victoria principal both offer great support as the respective ladies of the two male stars jan-michael shows real movie star persona in this film i don't think vigilante force is on video but it occasionally shows up on tv a great flick for guys who like movies
judy davis shows us here why she is one of most respected and loved actors her portrayal of a lonely directionless nomad is first-rate a teenaged claudia karvan also gives us a glimpse of what would make her one of this most popular actors in years to come with future roles in the big steal the heartbreak kid dating the enemy risk and the acclaimed tv series the secret life of us karvan as a child was a young girl whose toy panda was stolen outside a shop in the drama going down with tracey mann if this films comes your way make sure you see it rating see also hotel sorrento radiance vacant possession lantana
so when i was little i got this movie as a present and my sister and i loved it we would watch it all the time when our friends came over we would have sleepovers and we'd watch big rock candy mountain and magical toys i'm now and i still love this movie some old friends and i recently got together and watched it we knew all the songs and we danced and talked about how much we hated profster when we were little one friend actually bought this movie and magical toys for her year old daughter because she wants to pass on our love of this movie this really is a movie you can let your kids watch and feel safe no violence no bad language just lots of great songs and important lessons
truly this is a heart-warming film it won the george peobody award winning over roots so that may tell you something of the essence of this film i am looking on the internet how to order this movie since my former father-in-law eugene logan the co-writer of this film has been deceased for a few years now so i no longer have the opportunity to receive information from him i would love to have his only grand-daughters my daughters see this film as well as to pass this wonderful story on to his great-grandsons my oldest daughter was seven years old at the time it was aired on television and i since have been looking forward to seeing it again one of my friends said it was her favorite movie i won't spoil this movie for you
i must confess that i was completely shocked by this film for one i went to see it on a whim expecting something mediocre but given this the most shocking thing was that this was in a populist american cinema at all this is british comedy at its finest dark quirky and funny in ways that american films just never are i must stop short however of recommending this wholeheartedly to anyone i went to see it with several people some english some european and some american and while some of us loved it from the first two groups some hated it and found it worthless if you think you're into this kind of thing then go if not don't
friz rumours is an excellent private snafu cartoon that warns against spreading panic-inducing rumours during wartime produced as were all the snafu shorts to be shown to military audiences as entertaining instructional films rumours is extremely imaginative and crams tons of ideas into its very brief lifespan when snafu starts a rumour about a bombing it escalates into an eventual rumour that america has lost the war this is illustrated brilliantly by way of a long rubbery piece of baloney and several strange fictional creatures who come back to haunt snafu with ever more terrible news about his military rumours is inventive fast paced and funny all of which help to overshadow the rather laboured don't badmouth the military message it stands up as one of the best of the private snafu shorts
eddie izzard is genius with his non-stop humor i could listen all day his unique approach to life is quite logical his understanding of discovery as the heimlich maneuver is creative eddie izzard captures the heart of what we think i don't know when i laughed so hard at off-beat mind
i've been impressed with stance against globalisation for sometime now but it wasn't until i saw the film at the amsterdam documentary international film festival that i realize what he has really achieved this film tells the story of by elite the oil companies and oil loving corrupt western governments to remove democratically elected president chavez and return venezuela back to a brutal dictatorship this film is must for anyone who believes in freedom and justice and is also a lesson to the rest of world i commend the people of venezuela for taking matter into their own hands and saving their country from the likes of halliburton and the bush regime
i watched this film without knowing anything about it whatsoever and found it similar thematically to billy elliott both films are based around a troubled relationship in both films the son does not want to follow his father down the mines and dreams of a better life away from their home town both sons face derision by their classmates and both have a strong female role model who teaches major difference that i found between the films was that october sky was an infinitely more interesting and touching film laura dern puts in a moving performance and chris cooper plays the disapproving father very well as he went on to do in american beauty joe johnston surprised me with his subtle directing very different from his other directorial features such as jumanji and jurassic park iii
i swear i could watch this movie every weekend of my life and never get sick of it every aspect of human emotion is captured so magically by the acting the script the direction and the general feeling of this movie been a long time since i saw a movie that actually made me choke from laughter reflect from sadness and feel each intended feeling that comes through in this most excellent work we need more movies like this mike binder are you listening
soldier is not as bad as many have made it out to be i found the film to have some of the sacarstic cynical humour like that in paul starship troopers the lack of dialogue and over the top action is deliberate and adds to the comic-book particular trivia-bit stands out for me todd has the names of several space-war campaigns tattoo'd onto his chest and one of these battles is tannhauser gate for the oblivious ones out there tannhauser gate is mentioned in roy elegiac last lines in blade runner to imagine that todd could have fought alongside android troops like roy is mind boggling to say the least maybe script writer david peoples was give this one out of
not a bad martial arts film fight scenes were good michel qissi did a good job directing his first film without van damme story worked without foul language and too much blood screenwriter jeanette francessca has a good line to the story that works it would be great to see something else from her in the same genre she likes the art and having strong women promenant it was definitely worth watching i recommend the film to all drama and martial arts lovers

directed by samuel fuller who also wrote the screenplay pickup on south street is a tough brutal well made film about a pickpocket widmark who inadvertently aquires top-secret microfilm and becomes a target for espionage agents also involved are jean peters as a tough broad who is used as a courier by her evil ex-lover richard kiley film-noir at its best and although the performances are very good its grand character actress thelma ritter who steals the movie as moe a weary street peddler selling neck ties who also sells information she is terrific in a role that brought her another oscar nomination its amazing that miss ritter was nominated six times for an academy award and she never won this should have been the role that copped it for her
i really can say i felt the movie in its right essence where the mind games from dreamy reality enter into the surreal aspect of future faced by tom cruise i didn't cared much about tom acting prowess but i must say that he seems to impress at every point in the simply due to an engaging storyline but also due to his self being imparted to the lead merge and then speak and its beautiful however i must say this movie doesn't come under the average flick of weekend which you pick at random and watch gleefully it carries strong sentiments and characters so don't wash this one down with your beer and pop-corns it certainly needs more than that
a bit slow like a sofia coppola movie but still a very captivating film about the discovery of sexuality by three teenage girls the magic of the movie lies in its capacity to bring back many memories to how it felt like to be their age the confusion and the insecurities are portrayed in a very simple way but so true to life the music is perfect and the acting is amazing the camera works beautifully also i highly recommend it for those who are not afraid to look back at this particular period of life when we discover our sexual impulses and our desires i would also say that it is a fine film for young people going through that period so many movies have been made about adolescence but this really captures the true essence of discovering the adult world of romance and its complexities
this is the best movie i have ever seen the movie on dutch television sometime in month they were showing a yugoslavian movie every sunday next week there was another great movie a train rather than a bus the name of which i don't remember if you know it please let me know in any case how can i get to see this movie again a dvd of this movie where please tell me at next week there was another great movie a train rather than a bus the name of which i don't remember if you know it please let me know in any case how can i get to see this movie again a dvd of this movie where please tell me at
and gi joe go stuck in the water i die of laufther every time i see this movie and then a big brown shark came this is comedy at best this blows away the kings of comedy and anyone else andrew dice clay jerry tucker rock they can't thouch the man the myth the legend eddie eddie we want more more more more more
i didn't have many expectation going into the film but i thought it was fantastic pierce brosnan is outstanding in a very different role he has dumped the slick armani suits for a ridiculous look and pays off showing that he is an excellent actor pierce and greg kinnear play off each other great and make for one of the better buddy pairings in a long time the humor is dark the performances by brosnan kinnear and hope davis are great mix that with a touching element to the story about friendship and you have a great film this is probably one of the better buddy comedies in a long time this is a film that definitely shows that we can expect great things in the post-bond era of career
i personally liked this movie and am alarmed at the some people have given it it is a movie based on a comic book and it is animated now if you don't like comic books or animation then of course you won't like this movie so why did you watch and bother to rate it is beyond me though if you are a fan of interesting strong characters and women kicking butt and saving the you will love this movie i thought the story really pulled me in and it was a very cool movie quite anime-esque or more like some of the american movies following this new trend of adult animation like titan the live action version of punisher in the end i highly recommend this movie the comic buff and super hero fan or anyone with an open enough mind looking for a fun movie
bette midler is indescribable in this concert she gives her all every time she is on stage whether we are laughing at her jokes and antics or dabbing our eyes at the strains of one of her tremendous ballads bette midler moves her audience if you can't see it live is the best way to see bette then this is the next best thing an interesting thing to look at is how incredible her voice has changed and matured over the years but never lost its power her more vocally correct version of stay with me never loses anything in spirit from the rose or divine madness here it is just more pure and as heartfelt as ever i will treasure this concert for a very long time
in arlington heights il we never had a cafeteria in any of the elementary schools so i rode my bike home from school for lunch and always watched this game true i was but i thought it was the greatest thing on i'd draw hidden pictures on my blackboard and see if my family or friends could find it i also remember winning wonderful cars or oldsmobile if the contestant got the final hidden picture game i even had the home wonder why this game lasted so briefly i enjoyed the music and the hidden pictures the only one i could ever get was the lemon hidden as part of a bridge over a garden good memories are connected with camouflage
this is the best piece of film ever created its a master piece that brought a tear to my eye ill never forget my experience watching it i don't understand why people don't think as i do the dinosaur turns in a performance reminiscent of de niro in raging bull pacino in scarface and crowe in gladiator combined this should be released on dvd in superbit format so i can fully enjoy it like it was meant to be enjoyed when they produced and filmed it whoppi goldberg truly turns in the performance of a lifetime as a tough gritty cop who is against her will teamed with a hot shot dinosaur as her partner then the hi-jinx ensues to say the least by the way i'm saying the complete opposite of what is true this movie is utter garbage
i grew up in southern west virginia i'm about the same age as maybe a year older than homer hickam author of the rocket boys the book forming the true-story basis of this heart-warming so i relate closely to the west virginia coal-mining theme and to the stunning effect sputnik had at that time on all of us the rocket boys went on to make great lives for themselves i went on to get my degrees in physics and computer engineering all because sputnik woke up a lot of young people to the science gap the had on the in those cold war is a wonderful film for everyone of all ages but if you grew up in west virginia in the late it'll touch the core of your get it watch it recommend it to your friends who'll thank you many times
this is undeniably the scariest game i've ever played not the average shoot-everything-that-moves kind of fps i usually don't care much for but the acceptable gfx interesting weapons and magic great surround soundeffects scryeeee and above all incredible atmosphere i love the scrye which enables you at certain places in the games to see or hear events that happened there in the past the only game i've had to take regular breaks after a few minutes of playing just because of the intensity of the atmosphere i'm a great horror fan escpecially of clive stories and movies and participating in a horror story like this makes me yearn for more games that emphasizes atmosphere and a more involving story because i'm no fps fan and perhaps the game was a bit short
ah a sailor-suit musical so familiar right yes but this isn't the one you usually hear about on the that-a-way but if you stick around you might learn something okay probably not anyway anchors aweigh tells the story of two sailors on a or four-day leave joe is the sea wolf and clarence the bookish type begs joe to get him a dame now after they're picked up by the coppers they get little donald home where they meet susie that temptress that jezebel just kidding clarence falls in love with her at least he thinks he does is he right or is he a moron or is he just misguided by society find out all this and more when you watch anchors if you want to see kathryn grayson be anything but sickeningly sweet try kiss me kate
adam jones is headed for great things that is the thought i had after seeing his feature film cross eyed rarely does an independent film leave me feeling as good as his did cleverly written and masterfully directed cross eyed keeps you involved from beginning to end adam jones may not be a well known name yet but he will be if this movie had one or two named actors it would be a box office sensation i think it still has a chance to get seen by a main stream audience if just one film distributor takes the time to work this movie regardless of where it ends up if you get a chance to see it you won't be disappointed
for a film that got little publicity and few people have heard about this was pretty good another one of these modern-day british crime films that are quirky sexy beast etc not wild like snatch but interesting and it has some rough also has a corny and somewhat predictable ending but early in the show not late has some neat twists to make it very interesting for the first-time viewer basically about a low-key british male who sends away for a russian mail order bride who winds up with the aid of two russian male friends providing a couple of big chapin and nicole kidman co-star and are very good as are vincent cassel and matthieu kassovitz as russian cohorts this is a different kind of film and well-acted kidman once again proves far more than just a beautiful face
the film adaptation of james ulysses is excellent the actors the voice overs the direction it all captures the feel of the novel without sacrificing its own merits the milo does an excellent job as leopold bloom the cuckolded man married to the sassy molly i absolutely love this picture
reign over me adam sandler don cheadle jada pinkett-smith liv tyler saffron burrows donald sutherland robert klein melinda dillon mike binder jonathan banks rae allen paula newsome at times affecting and at times middling dramedy about a thoroughly depressed man who lost his family on in his best role since punch-drunk love who winds up re-united with his old college roommate and friend continuing to do impressive work with every role to date a well-to-do dentist who seems to have it all family wealth happiness but really sees an ally in freedom with his troubled own personal life offerings written and directed by binder co-stars as former-best friend and acting accountant with equal parts humor and genuine heartache the film works best when the two stars share the screen until the last act falls into an almost movie-of-the-week treacle with to tidy a solution to the matters at hand
i loved this movie i knew it would be chocked full of camp and silliness like the original series i found it very heart warming to see adam west burt ward frank gorshin and julie newmar all back together once again anyone who loved the batman series from the should have enjoyed return to the batcave you could tell the actors had a lot of fun making this film especially adam west and i'll bet he would have gladly jumped back into his batman costume had the script required him to do so i told a number of friends about this movie who chose not to view it now they wished they had i have all of the original episodes on vhs now this movie will join my collection thank you for the reunion adam and burt
this was one of the best war movies i've seen because it focuses on the characters more then the actual war all of the cast do an excellent job and because most of them are relative unknowns it makes everything seem more believable the camera footage is great is so was the pacing and editing this movie will actually get to you and causes the audience to care for the charcters
this movie is the first time movie experience for several people in the cast all of them are experienced actors and have played in several tv series and plays sahan gokbakar is a well known comedian in turkey kind of strange to see him in a thriller while he is at the peak of his comedy career in turkey this movie is togan first long shot and pretty much the first experience as a director but they all did a good job we are happy to see such enthusiastic young cast they seem very promising for the future of the turkish film industry doga rutkay being long time sweetheart of sahan gokbakar is also a talented actress who is known for her recent play in number theatrical play and several tv series
this is one the few movies i can watch over and over if you've never seen it give it a shot richard dreyfus and raoul julia are wonderful together and although the movie amuses me greatly it reminds me of untimely demise it is a good opportunity to sit back and laugh at the international intrigue that is too much with us in these time of terror and fear
i've only watched the first series on dvd but would summarise the sopranos as a shakespearean plot with a tarantino-like script the series is as good as goodfellas and casino and almost as good as the godfather not a and far better than any of guy efforts although plenty of action some of it pretty bloody the story is character driven even some of the minor characters contribute to great story lines the relationship lack of with carmilla and the wife and christopher and his dimwit friend didn't last very long darwin award from the plot the script and the acting the other reasons i liked it made me want to visit new jersey and eat pasta with a tomatoey sauce the music it shows that literally anyone can suffer from mental health problems
if you have ever read and enjoyed a novel by tom robbins you will appreciate this movie as a whole-hearted attempt to translate his outrageously unconventional writing style into a workable piece of big screen art the actors and the direction of this film are both good only trouble with the film as i can see it is that robbins can relate ideas and sentiments with his words that were still beyond capabilities at the time this film was both the irreverence of movies as well as the willingness and abilityof audiences to delve into the bizarre i think even cowgirls would receive a better reception today than it did when it was originally released
gung ho is one of those movies that you will want to see over and over again michael keaton is put in charge of wooing a japanese car company to come to his town thus creating jobs for the residents of hadleyville what happens after that is one hilarious moment after another the two cultures clash and it is up to keaton to hold things together look for great performances from keaton gedde watanabe george wendt mimi rogers john turturro soh yamamura and sab shimomo all are perfectly cast don't be fooled by the low number rating this is a in my book it is interesting to note that the town name of hadleyville was also used in high noon yes there is a real hadleyville but in oregon
i somehow missed this movie when it came out and have discovered it as late as last week thanks to a recommendation i can honestly say that i cannot remember another intimate dramatic film which does so many things so well the writing is crisp realistic nuanced and even restrained the cinematography and editing are understated but inspired enabling the visual storytelling to dominate through marvelous close-ups and framing of images capturing loneliness and alienation in most memorable ways the acting is also wonderful with all of the characters becoming painfully real and vulnerable in the most compelling ways that a film can offer they reveal their innermost weaknesses with unprotected raw vulnerability a real triumph for roger michell and hanif kureishi and the rest of the team a must see for serious film lovers
cliffhanger is what appears to be slyvester last action movie before he became such an underrated actor about a mountain climber that must help his friend after being held hostage by mercenaries that want them to find three suitcases carrying money over million dollars it has great action edge of your seat fun and a great time at the movies
up never got the respect it should have it works on many levels and has a complicated but followable plot the actors involved give some of their finest performances ann-margret roy scheider and john glover are perfectly cast and provide deep character portrayals notable too are vanity who should have parlayed this into a serious acting career given the unexpected ability she shows and kelly preston character will haunt you for a few days anyone who likes action combined with a gritty complicated story will enjoy this
the scintillating elizabeth taylor stars in this lesser-known classic as a young girl from london who falls in love with a tea plantation owner from british ceylon day sri lanka upon arrival she instantly feels out of place and is forced to adapt to the new culture as well as be in constant awareness of the angry elephant herd william dieterle who also directed the life of emile zola and portrait of jennie does a masterful job of bringing a somewhat dark and almost eerie undertone to this romance and the setting is one of the most beautiful i've seen with the black and white themed mansion and the gorgeous island scenery
this film does a superb job of depicting the plight of an als the subject is done with compassion as well as humor helena bonham carter is so convincing as a person with als that i found it hard to believe that she was only acting kenneth branagh a superb actor lives up to expectations as the quirky artist who misbehaves and is forced to provide companionship to character as part of his community service an alternative to prison time watching the development of the relationship between these two is a treat from beginning to end tha fact that it is a fairy tale does not detract from the fabulous performances one comes to care deeply for the two of them
i just saw this film i first saw it when i was and could just about remember the end so i watched it like minutes ago and may seem like a baby as i am ha-ha i started to cry at the ending i forgotten how sad it was i think i was mainly sad for anne-marie because she said i love you charlie and also i'll miss you charlie just made me really cry ha-ha it has to be one of me favourite movies of all time it is just a film well worth watching watch it ha-ha thats all i can say i love this film its a true maverick xx
sudden impact is the best of the five dirty harry movies they don't come any leaner and meaner than this as harry romps through a series of violent clashes with the bad guys getting their just desserts which is just the way i like it great story too and ably directed by clint himself excellent entertainment
i saw jack frost for at my local store and i thought it looks pretty good for a low budget movie so i bought it and i was right it was good for starters this film is about a killer snowman so something to laugh about and the way it looks was funny compared to the snowman on the cover acting was okay and the lines jack frost said had me laughing i only axed you for a smoke and worlds most off snow cone how funny and camp is that the tale at the start was pretty funny and silly too jack be nimble jack be quick jack gouged eyes with candle sticks if you're looking for a for a b-movie comedy horror full of puns then check jack frost out
i thought it was an extremely clever film i was very pleased with it and truly couldn't ask for more i actually own the film because i didn't return it to someone which i should do but i really want to keep it due to how much i enjoyed it also the fact i don't own too many foreign films and this is a first now i personally love finnish stuff so that definitely added to how much i enjoyed it but overall its worth watching however if you're not into the whole trying to understand finnish or read subtitles bit then this film is not for for sure
this is the movie for those who believe cinema is the seventh art not an entertainment business lars von trier creates a noir atmosphere of post-war germany utterly captivating you get absorbed into the dream and you're let go only at the end credits the plot necessarily comes second but it still is a thrilling story with tough issues being raised just wonderful
i had some reservations about this movie i figured it would be the usual bill of fare a formula movie about christmas being in the middle of a heat wave in late june we decided to give it a shot anyway maybe we would see some movie turned out to be one laugh after another ben affleck was believable in his character but the real star of this one is james gandofini he delivered his lines with a real wit about him and made a great you want to have an enjoyable couple of hours definitely check this one out
every one should see this movie because each one of us is broken in some way and it may help us realize my life isn't as bad as i thought it was and how important it is to adopt a child in need there are so many out there to think that the movie was actually based on a real person made us think deep about life and how the world has and always will be corrupt but that corruption doesn't have to reach your home we all have a choice definitely recommend this one and while you're at it i'd like to throw in the color purple and woman thou art loosed by are all movies that are based on life and give us a glimpse of life
pinjar is a genuinely good film with great acting good narrative good presentation touching emotions seems to me that the quality of films that bollywood is producing is quite improving these days and this film is one bollywood movie that i can remember of made such an impact on me i was literally thinking about the movie for hours marvelling at the various emotional situations that test the human in a film rests on the great acting of urmilla matondkar and also some from manoj bajpai urmilla plays a girl in north india in the background of the partition and all troubles seem sweet if compared with the problems she happens to face must-see film a technically superior bollywood product which i feel is comparable to the best movies coming out of other countries in the world
actually one particular isn't right there but my summary line is referring to the power of the movie and this is all achieved without any fancy camera moves big production sets but with a great story and very and good actors conveying the story could call it a companion piece to great japan as tokyo story etc not so much story-wise of course but more mood-wise great acting nuances in the performances that are truly gems if you're eager to experience a touching story and want to see a movie touching you emotionally than this is the one to go as you have noticed with many of my reviews i'm not getting into the story there are places here at imdb where you can look those up i'm not one to spoiler the story whatsoever
the van is a simple teensploitation picture made especially for the drive in that goes out of way to make you feel comfortable providing many opportunities to laugh and cry with your friends danny devito has a small yet plentiful role as the manager of a car wash and almost steals the show all the leads are well acted the characters complex and the directing quite competent for this type of picture a crown international release
bette midler showcases her talents and beauty in diva las vegas i am thrilled that i taped it and i am able to view whenever i want to she possesses what it takes to keep an audience in captivity her voice is as beautiful as ever and will truly impress you the highlight of the show was her singing stay with me from her movie the rose you can feel the emotion in the song and will end up having goose bumps the show will leave you with the urge to go out and either rent a bette midler movie or go to the nearest music store and purchase one of bette albums

ever since seeing this film as a child over years ago i never tire of watching it from the opening scenes in the horn factory to the car motor running from the back seat of the car to ollie answering the phone and being accidentally pushed out the window by stan i think this was perhaps their best latter day film after this they moved to century fox and while those films weren't terrible they lacked the comic timing of this movie jimmy finnlayson their long time foil in his last appearance with the boys showing up as the doctor is super quote i said goat milk his reply to stan asking him how do you milk a ghost charlie hall and even ben turpin show up i'd say all in all one of my favorite l h comedies

the acting in this movie was superb as an amateur rocketeer i found very few mistakes as a human being it touched my heart and soul to watch the actors you would think that they are the actual characters laura dern a favorite actress of mine left nothing out of her performance the young actors playing the rocket boys showed talent beyond their years especially young homer father inspired that eternal relationship between a father and son so that it felt real if you don't get a lump in your throat or shed a tear when that first successful rocket goes up or when father and son come to terms then get your pulse checked may be dead
iphigenia is the great achievement of michael cacoyannis this masterful play is masterfully adapted for the screen and brought to life by a wonderful cast cacoyannis achieved the impossible he managed to film a greek tragedy to screen without losing its effectiveness and importance a stellar greek cast helps him in this newcomer tatiana papamoschou is extremely impressive as iphigenia equally impressive is irene papas who even though she sometimes seems over the top it is very realistic a wonderful greek film beautifully adapted and directed by michael cacoyannis with an excellent music score by mikis theodorakis which is ideal in every rumours say that the film lost the best foreign language film oscar by only vote
this is an excellent film and is the sort of treasure that one can only catch through sporadic cinema showings as it is unavailable on the way that the film begins with the two lovers arriving and ends with them leaving quite a lot happens in between and they don't stay in one place during this time gives you a sense of closure and a feeling that all is right with the world if you get a chance to see this film then do i can't wait to see it again and wish that it could be put on general release

just like final fantasy brought cg to a whole new level this is a rebirth for motion capture neither movie nor cartoon this motion picture looks like a homage to the film noir akira sin city blade runner and the new generation of european cartoonists you see paris the way it almost could be the characters seem as real as you and i they blink trip shiver like real actors in a way never achieved go watch it hoping to find a mind twister you will most likely figure it out before you're half way from the movie the scenario is certainly too simplistic compared to famous thrillers but this definitely is bliss for the eyes
yesterday i went alone to the cinema because here in mexico most of the times movies from other countries are part of the so called camára alternativa camera but after i saw this movie i realized that not all the foreign movies are alternative afortunately this is a good a example but i have to said that i enjoyed so much this movie that at the end i was happy this movie is a little spoon of hope in these days and the main lesson for me is that at the end of the love is main force behind us this is a good option to see a good movie in i have to mention the good music specially the main song of the movie cosas que hacen que la vida valga la pena excellent song
this film was excellent i thought that the original one was quiet mediocre this one however got all the ingredients a factory hemi challenger with speed transmission that really shows that mother mopar knew how to build the best muscle cars i was in chrysler heaven every time kowalski floored that big block hemi and he sure did that a lot
slaughter high is a totally ridiculous slasher flick about a high school nerd gets pick on all the time by some prank goes wrong and he ends up getting savagely years later his tormentors all attend a reunion-just the ten of them of low and behold marty murders them one after actress caroline the cast as the dies acting is completely also no suspense at of grotesque death scenes to satisfy the stomach female victim literally gets an acid couple having sex in bed get guy is crushed by a girl is a doctor gets a hyperdermic needle in the killer wears a decent and rather creepy mask and the beautiful old english really the dream finale is utterly in all true that slaughter high is a piece of i enjoyed for fans of truly bad slasher flicks
ea have shown us that they can make a classic agent and make you feel in the world the graphics of the game are outstanding and also the voice recording is very professional i got this game april years after release and i am still impressed with the gameplay a shame that ea will no longer make give this game for the levels it contains especially the consulate level i would recommend this game to anyone from the age of and over the only thing i didn't like in the game is the russian boat level it was too much pressure on the whole i like the game a lot
this is the kind of movie the us doesn't make why people rent foreign films a great story about how one person even if he is retarded can make a person find reason in an empty life everybody can learn from georges it also shows how people that are mentally challenged suffer in their life and shows them in a very realistic way think as its classic in foreign films this movie has a bittersweet ending but that only makes it a better movie
all dogs go to heaven is the most cutest animated film to have dogs in the previous don bluth film the land before became a success dogs are so cute as little mice aw i just want to hug them when they're cute where was i oh yes its animation is beautiful the characters are great when they're perfectly voiced and the songs are cute and touching it opened in november the same date as the little mermaid produced by walt disney feature part where charlie got killed by carface was so unforgivable carface is so mean because he wanted to kill charlie shame on him the love survive song performed by irene cara and freddie jackson was so beautiful all dogs go to heaven is the best animated movie ever
this show is awesome i have been a fan since it premiered and it only keeps me watching i've seen some terrible things here that i wish i hadn't but it really shows you how addiction affects all involved not just the addict you can see all kinds of different addictions from drugs and alcohol to the shopping addict or the eating disorder addict and actually really sad to see some of the famous faces that have come through also we've seen accomplished musicians an nba player and even young people who really need the help and since they have started showing a few follow-ups been awesome too now you can see how they are a long while after their ep aired if you haven't checked this one out please do on and awesome the new eps are sunday nights at est if i remember correctly so set your tivo
ok so a for a star movie you see this one and maybe it will make more sense hitchcock never blended scenes together film weaves scenes together flawlessly from the start and yet you don't get that scattered feeling you sometimes get when a movie runs you through the many characters it attempts to develop you sense that the characters will show you something unusual about themselves and then they don't disappoint you when they do phil surreal tale of life blended with an absolutely superb soundtrack makes you think more about the degrees of separation in life than the movie by the same will be looking for more good things from this producer in the future
though derivative labyrinth still stands as the highlight of the mid-half of the six-year-old show finally a story allows welling to show how he has grown as an actor not easy playing a character that is the embodiment of truth justice and the american way on a weekly basis with very little variation his performance permitting him to show how one might react if discovers that all that he knew may be a lie was quite rose to the occasion always michael rosenbaum as the handicapped lex delivered as did kristen kreuk as a too-sweet-to-be-believed lana allison mack the ever-present chloe also scored as a slightly off-her-rocker use of an annoying hum in the background added to the tone of the installment and made for an engaging drama
oscar-caliber performance by peter falk in an oscar-caliber-written role i loved the nuanced balanced exploration of a long-time marriage how often do we get that in films where usually the movie ends when boy girl get together this is a movie for adults a complex view through the eyes of all parties husband wife son how each have adapted to each other in the past and grow during the story on top of that it gave me about major belly laughs and i'm one of those people who usually sits unamused when the rest of an audience is laughing this was one of the few truly funny movies i've seen great original jokes
the three stooges has always been some of the many actors that i have loved i love just about every one of the shorts that they have made i love all six of the stooges shemp moe larry joe and curly joe all of the shorts are hilarious and also star many other great actors and actresses which a lot of them was in many of the shorts in my opinion the three stooges is some of the greatest actors ever and is the all time funniest comedy team is a good three stooges short it funny and its cast includes christine boniface gino corrado fred kelsey sam flint chester conklin theodore lorch lynton brent judy malcolm vernon dent john tyrrell heinie conklin and bess flowers the stooges performed very well in this short i recommend this one
i originally watched simple rules on the disney channel uk for the first series and got completely hooked when they didn't show it any more was annoyed but then abc satred showing the series i didn't think another series would start after i read john ritter had died however the series wasn't amazing the latest series is back to old excellent standard i hope they go on to produce more shows soon even though i could watch each show a thousand times kaley couco is my favourite character as airhead bridget and also performs amazing in charmed rory is also good he shares my name and grampa as keep on watching it until it ends until then i hope it carries on as funny as ever
in a time when hollywood is making money by showing our weaknesses despair crime drugs and war along comes this film which reminds us the concept of the indomitable spirit if you are feeling beaten down this movie will free your mind and set you soaring we all know how tough life can be sometime we need to be reminded that persistence and courage will get us through what this film did for me and i hope it will for you
this show is good i like the acting funny bits and the cuteness of it the actors lee pace ann friel etc they all did great in the show the show started off great with its funny illogical basic idea of bringing dead people back in the first series and honestly as what people said the first few episodes of the second series were a bit of a let down but it later came back looking good anyway and now i really hate the fact that going to be cancelled why doesn't abc just let it finish until the very end when all the episodes are already done i really wanna know how the going to be i think it should be given a chance as there're still so many viewers who love it
okay that was a pretty damn good episode much better than the credit it camera work is splendid best yet i love that final shot the atmosphere is fantastic the costumes are great and the guest cast the helpless victims is strong i don't like about this episode is that many things that are left unexplained why does it change sex the purpose and they're aliens what kind why were they never shown again in the later giving this episode a high three stars one of my favorites yet but the plot holes bother me still not gonna let it ruin my entertainment
i watched this film a few times in the and nearly split my sides laughing each time i love eddie murphy as an actor but this stand up is some thing else he is so funny even the brigade would find this hilarious a must watch and even better if you've got the guys or girls in for a drink the take off of michael jackson is so like him if you close your eyes you believe him singing the things he describes are true to life and you would seriously have to have a humour bypass if you thought this was not funny my local video stores do not stock this video any more but i would love to get my hands on a copy to show my husband and boys when they are old enough to appreciate the humour anyway highly recommended hope you enjoy
i honestly think that that was the best version of war of the worlds i've every seen it was funny but it was also educational i learned whole lot the movie and if i could i would by that movie my favorite part was when the soldiers killed on robot and another one came right from behind it in the last movie war of the world i think that it should have been more like the first one and it would have been better but any way i give this movie thumbs up if they where to make another movie like this i will definitely watch you
i found this to be a profoundly amusing dark comedy brosnan is genius as anyone will now testify he is not to be pigeonholed in the bond role kinnear was as charismatic and as funny as anyone could have been in the role i don't know if i've laughed as hard during any movie what an unexpected pleasure my favourite line would be i feel like a bangkok hooker on a sunday after the navy left town brosnan delivered this very un-bond line with such unexpected comedic finesse i was also very impressed with hope performance it seems like everyone in this movie branched out from their previous work to such a degree that it actually improved the comedy if you liked the dark and hilarious the weather man you will definitely like this voted
and laugh out loud funny in many basic plot is well chronicled a story of opposites trying to find a way to survive each other in close is unquestionably lemmon and best film as co-stars and the interaction between the sloppy oscar and the ocd felix are scene where oscar lines up a double date leaves the room briefly and comes back to find felix and the two girls all crying is pricelessly any fan of intelligent comedies the odd couple is a go out of your way to see it film
read my lips tells of a strange symbiosis which develops between a plain socially maladroit female office worker and her workplace trainee a crude excon as the film fleshes out this unlikely duo down to their ids they become embroiled in a chilling merging of the minds each using the other for their own selfish reasons with an extraordinary outcome good stuff for anyone into character-driven films with strong psychodramatic undercurrents in french with easy to read subtitles and good translation
this film is a quite entertaining horror anthology film the lines of tales from the crypt written by robert bloch of psycho good fun for horror fans and has an excellent cast the movie should also be required viewing for doctor who fans since jon pertwee third doctor has an amusing role as a rude and obnoxious horror star
one of the funnest i've ever played the levels are creative there are fluid controls and good graphics for its time also a multitude of crazy bosses and enemies to fight sometimes the levels get frustrating and if you leave out some of the hard levels and still need to get more accomplished to fight a boss it can be annoying another complaint is the camera angle though it works fairly well most of the time it can be a pain in certain situations if your a big time mario fan this ones for you even if your not a huge fan of him i'd still recommend this one its a big game and getting what you need can take a while but very satisfying good for playing in short bursts of time it will almost certainly hold your interest it sure does hold mine
i wish i could laugh again as much as when i saw this show for the first time i have not done so ever strange thing is i find myself laughing almost as hard after watching the show again and again izzard is cultivated is poignant is a man of the world he is deft talking about politics and yet feels no need to engage in political discussion he is above that i would contrast him to george carlin who uses his comedy to try and convince people about his ideas and does not seem to enjoy the fact that he is trying to guy on earth
i watched the trailer on the dvd after seeing the film and i think anyone who saw it before watching the film would be very surprised and possibly disappointed it made much of the fact that the film was by the director of cube and made it look like a horror film when in fact it is an absurdist comedy spell checker doesn't seem to think that absurdist is a word but it is reminiscent of rosencrantz and guildernstern are love the way the story builds up slowly at first then gradually escalates i also enjoy the fact that no explanation is given for what happens in the film that and the fact that the story plays out mainly in just the one set are the only respects in which this film is similar to cube i recommend it
this is a great movie it shows what our government will to to other countries if we don't like their government this isn't as bad as what reagan and bush number one did to south america but the us still has no business messing around with other countries like this this movies also proves that american media spouts government propaganda this is exactly what they did to aristide in haiti the reason this coup against chavez didn't succeed is chavez was elected with over of the movie isn't just a political documentary it would still be a great movie if it were a drama amazing that this is other reviewer is lying when he says chavez seizes the airwaves the private media is running anti chavez propaganda all the time
i didn't expect much when i first saw the dvd cover i mean pierce brosnan as grey then the story got underway unfolded in a beautifully photographed and paced film i was surprised and delighted at this true story made me want to read more about this fascinating character which means the director fulfilled his purpose and the film was a success
i caught a bit of this concert on public television and knew i had to have it the boys give everyone at the royal albert an excellent often thrilling performance complete in every way pure too no synth no smoke-shrouded lasers and strobes no grandiose entrance an unstoned serious and appreciative audience all of whom left their bottle rockets at you're a cream fan if you've only heard of them if you're a blues fan if you're a rock n roll fan you will not be disappointed when you view and listen to this dvd you also will never lose this dvd because you'll never lend it to anyone dvd justifies selfishness tell them to get their own too good and too replayable you'll want to keep it within easy reach
a film i expected very little from and only watched to pass a quiet hour but what an hour it turned out to be roll is an excellent if none-too-serious little story of country-boy-lost-in-the-big-city-makes-good it is funny throughout the characters are endearing and the pace is just malone is the true star of the film with his endearing portrayal of matt said country boy and local aussie rules football hero come to the big city to try out for one of the big teams he is supported superbly by john batchelor as local gangster tiny watch out for these recommended
first and foremost i would like to say that i'm a huge sarah silverman fan and having other people say that and then rag on the pilot is beyond me everything in the pilot was in typical sarah silverman form maybe not directly funny but the situation and the delivery are what you liked jesus is magic then i don't see how you wouldn't like this it has that same flow and that same rhythm true only for the true fans but if you are you'll be only for the true fans no way around that if you're not used to her style then you wouldn't get why this is funny however it is and i hope you think so too
that kid a is such a babe this movie was no titan which it is in many ways modeled after but still came off as entertaining the fact this lost to a piece of monkey crap like tomb raider makes wanna cry includes some of the most entertaining characters i've seen in disney film
okay this show is nothing but awesome it has a great story line and plot and great actors and actresses jeremy sumpter is so hott and he is perfect for the role he is gunna be big in hollywood he has a bright future ahead this show better last a long time because i really love this show and i hope that it has a lot of success it is so interesting i have been waiting for it to come out for about or months and finally here and great i tape it too i can watch it whenever i want now too bad its only on once a week though i wish it was on at least twice a week because now i wish that it was tuesday every day hope you all like this
this is a great movie for any fan of hong kong action movies asides from little plot the weak drama and bits of comedy antics the movie is action packed with gun-fighting and martial arts action kept me entertained from beginning until the end i thought shannon lee was awesome in the an action director like corey yuen is what keeps hong kong action going strong this modern action film is highly recommended
why can't this type of compact entertaining mystery be filmed in the new century it keeps the viewer thinking and guessing all the way the cast is a great ensemble william powell exhibits true star quality who he was rehearsing for his future as nick charles he is a joy to watch one also can see why eugene pallette made more than films he is a great supporting character actor and his excellent chemistry with powell is fun to watch mary astor does above average work in a not very meaty role all other hands chip in to make this a thoroughly enjoyable way to spend minutes i suspect michael curtiz had a ball directing his one bravo
first off i'll be the first to admit that the scarecrow himself is quite a bit over-the-top a toned down maybe less acrobatic scarecrow would've made this movie much less cheesy but overall i think one of the better b-movies tiffany shepis is absolutely wonderful not to mention incredibly beautiful though this movie is missing the all-important nude factor there are several other movies at which to view her but here she gets all evil-hotness especially towards the end as walking away from the engulfed scarecrow also richard elfman does a great job as sheriff and as the drunk boyfriend yes a low budget b-movie but out of all of them i've seen this is definitely one of my very top favorites
a charming romantic comedy the plot is a little too tried to summarize it three times and i can't suffice to say worth seeing the movie is funny plot is totally unrealistic but it works everybody in the movie is so nice and everything looks so creates a sweet romantic feel through the entire film acting is downey jr and cybill shepherd are in top form and enjoying every second of it ryan o'neal and mary stuart masterson are just ok but fine if you're a sucker for good sweet sentimental films me catch this one also downey looks great in his title song sung by johnny mathis and another great song after all sung by cher and peter cetera
this is simply the funniest movie i've seen in a long time the bad acting bad script bad scenery bad costumes bad camera work and bad special effects are so stupid that you find yourself reeling with not gonna win an oscar but if you've got beer and friends round then you can't go wrong
oh the sixties there were some interesting films i was more of a movie goer then i now enjoy renting movies and relaxing in my home rather than going to the theater i also saw this short film the legend of the boy and the eagle i have been searching for this film for years it was truly inspiring surprisingly i was finally able to gather more information from your site thank you i'm surprised to find out that this short film was an opening for a disney picture i too did not remember the disney film i did not even remember that it was an opening film for disney i truly wish they would show this on tv sometime i wonder if disey holds the rights to this film is it available on dvd this is a must see for all generations
superb cast more you can catch just about anything else written by plater starring these wonderful actors for anyone who doesn't know plater has a real feeling for jazz my recommendation is to see the beiderbecke trilogy whenever you three kinds of jazz hot cool and what time does the tune start
lisa is a hotel manager or owner and she gets on a flight to miami she ends up sitting next to an assassin named jackson who tells her that she has to switch a room of a family or her father dies the reason she has to switch the room is because jackson wants to blow it a great suspense movie because lisa tries several ways to escape this ploy that jackson has set up the whole storyline is great and i thought that they could have spent some more time on the plane there could have more to the plane but other than that the whole movie was pretty especially liked the ending because it was heart-stopping i didn't know what was going to happen and i was surprised by it for me this movie just took off
i thought this was an awesome movie the theme song is sweet anyway the only thing that somewhat bothered me was in the beginning when everything should have been normal it was very weird and unrealistic the big cable company is mainly what i'm talking about apart from that the movie was very creative i think that all the acting was well done the actors acted out their characters personalities perfectly everything fit together well it really is a shame that their isn't a soundtrack that would have been great because this is a canadian film and because it is one of my favorites i give this movie a out of
when i learned of sir alec guinness death this was the first of his many films i thought of re-seeing what a wonderful droll commentary the film provides even after all these years and guinness helps to weave the charm into every frame his eyes and face are as luminous as that white suit he wears both he and the film have to be considered lifetime favorites
beautiful and touching movie rich colors great settings good acting and one of the most charming movies i have seen in a while i never saw such an interesting setting when i was in china my wife liked it so much she asked me to log on and rate it so other would enjoy too
absolutely wonderful drama and ros is top highly recommend this movie her performance in my opinion was academy award material the only real sad fact here is that universal hasn't seen to it that this movie was ever available on any video format whether it be tape or dvd they are ignoring a very good movie but universal has little regard for its library on dvd which is sad if you get the chance to see this somewhere sure why it is rarely even run on cable see it i won't go into the story because i think most people would rather have an opinion on the film and too many reviewers spend hours writing about the story which is available
i loved this excellent movie farrah fawcett played the part phenomenally and with good heart she plays a woman who is driven to extreme measures to protect herself and her friends after she is attacked by a stranger after being rejected by the police she realizes she is on her one day when she at home alone the stranger breaks into her home and attacks her again not being about to call the police or get him out she is forced to spray him in the eyes and imprisons him in her think there is a need for a wake up call to the laws of the land they are too easy on these criminals time for more harsh punishments
i thought that this film was very enjoyable i watched this film with my wife before i had my first child therefore i was not watching it as simply family entertainment and i still thoroughly enjoyed it it seems as though many of the reviews are pointing out that this movie is not earth shattering there were no unexpected plot changes and that the movie was predictable and boring if these people were watching this movie expecting to have a religious experience doing so then they were obviously going to be disappointed this is simply an animated movie nothing more if you want to see this movie simply to sit back and let yourself be entertained you will not be disappointed in closing this is definitely not the best movie disney has made but it is entertaining and i do not understand the bad reputation it has received
sure this was a remake of a film but it had the suspense and action of a current film say breakdown running desperate to be with his hospitalized wife the police are the least concern the chases were very good the part with him at a rest stop was well done the end of the movie was a great cliffhanger this is better than bullitt a boring movie with what a muscle car chase that was filmed badly character knew what he had to do to escape johnny law few movies had the effects-night vision cb radio-okay i forgot the name of the movie guy has souped up toys with guy he upset the ending is great you can't tell if he fakes his suicide or not a very good did-he-make-it-or-not
eytan fox did it again move the heart in a modest story taking place in an overwhelming mess the movie also succeeds in describing so perfectly and subtly the atmosphere of the incredible city that is tel was there a month ago and it is all there the lifestyle the relationships the heart-beating city the mess the chock of utopian mindsets in the most light-hearted blithe and oblivious megalopolis recommend it is a voyage for the heart and the mind with an interesting perspective to the israelo-palestinian bene there is central gay plot in the movie if you do not think you are too gay-friendly be prepared to be challenged and finally see it as just love don't worry the chick is hot too
this is an very good movie this is one that i would rent over and over again it is not like your normal superhero movie this movie blends comedy action and great special effects it even has a person in it that does a lot of voices on the simpsons william h macy is the bomb
this was my first introduction to the world of bollywood and i'm now hooked okay so it requires adoption of a different mindset to watching us films but once you allow yourself the pleasure of enjoying it for what it is you won't be disappointed the songs are superb melodic and very catchy the actors are visually compelling especially karisma kapoor who is surely one of the most beautiful actresses anywhere in the film world locations colour are spellbinding if you want something different and are looking to be uplifted cheered up and stimulated i recommend you catch this movie
i think charlotte gainsbourg is one of the best performers in the world i can't understand why some people say not boring maybe the one who said boring is because is boring a great actress and the movie was excellent it has lots of wonderful ideas and very good performers the direction was great i imaging myself in the french environment with all the sophistication and perfume flowers churches problems etc when she goes to the shop is simply amazing great we have a very good actress wonderful for long time alain chabat and bernadette lafont are perfect i like him more than in his next movie la science des rêves and eric lartigau did a very good
when two writers make a screenplay of a horror version of breakfast at you know something is going to go right drew barrymore patrick highsmith leslie hope and sally kellerman are excellent actors the fbi agent was a terrible actor the scenes where patrick looked holly up and down like some sort of objectifier those was just weird drew barrymore is very hot intimate strangers where sally kellerman worked was a great part the weird gummy worm was just weird nathan was a very handsome cat but what was that scene where patrick followed holly into a cesspool and mr gooding attacked him and the scene with dr wallace what was he doing fumbling around in there and not every male has a female as sally kellerman stated and when patrick and elizabeth saw drew outside of that was weird
about a year ago i finally gave up on american television i thought of giving up television completely until a friend who had lived in england showed me some programs that included the office extras blackadder and the league of gentlemen it was then that i decided to switch to british television among all the shows listed above the league of gentlemen is easily the most dark and twisted of them all providing guilty laughs and material not found in any other comedy i've seen yet characters included are the most unhappily married couple a butcher that puts ingredients in the meat that go unsaid for the best a deranged couple that look over a local shop that only caters to local people and the worst veterinarian ever this program is one of the best i've seen
when i saw the elaborate dvd box for this and the dreadful red queen figurine i felt certain i was in for a big disappointment but surprise surprise i loved it convoluted nonsense of course and unforgivable that such a complicated denouement should be rushed to the point of barely being able to read the subtitles let alone take in the ridiculous explanation these quibbles apart however the film is a dream fabulous ladies in fabulous outfits in wonderful settings and the whole thing constantly on the move and accompanied by a wonderful bruno nicolai score he may not be morricone but in these lighter pieces he might as well be so really enjoyable with lots of colour plenty of sexiness some gory kills and minimal police interference super
great movie loved it great editing and use of the soundtrack captures the real feeling of indian life yet we can all relate a well chose cast with some great characters the movie develops all the characters so that you real care about them all and you feel like you know them the use of the indian music and drums in some of the soccer scenes is great and the direction really works as everyone comes off as real and natural you just can't help but to root for jess in this film the acting was really good even the tomboyish walk and body posture of both leading ladies is very convincing as a someone that played lots of soccer
enchanted april is a tone poem an impressionist painting a masterpiece of conveying a message with few words it has been one of my favorite films since it came out i continue to wait albeit less patiently for the film to come out in dvd format apparently i am not parent company listings are correct there are many people who want this title in dvd format many people want to go to italy with this cast and this script many people want to keep a permanent copy of this film in their libraries the cast is spectacular the cinematography and direction impeccable the film is a definite keeper many have already asked please add our names to the list
