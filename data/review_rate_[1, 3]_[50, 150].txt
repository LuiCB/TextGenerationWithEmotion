i had been looking forward to seeing this film for a long time after seeing return to paradise which i found to be gritty i was so disappointed the most realistic thing about it was the unpredictable ending which i think was partly stolen from return to paradise i was expecting too much the positive side danes beckinsale and pullman were fantastic in their roles although i didnt like character and first and found her very annoying couldnt see anything realistic about the film it could of been done so much better for example there could of been more emphasis on the prison conditions and the sheer horror it was too cheery a movie to be realistic there could also of been more action and best thing about this film is the tragic ending i couldnt of predicted that but by that time i really didnt care what happened to
this picture started out with good intentions bacon the scientist out to test the theory of invisibility and shue is cute as usual in her role it all falls apart after that your typical hollywood thriller now filmed on a soundstage with special effects galore minus any kind of humour wit or soul in other words don't waste your time watching this get the audiocassette tape with john delancie as the invisible man instead also starring leonard nimoy now that was good and hg wells is well served unlike with this mess
this film has to be the worst i have ever seen the title of the film deceives the audience into thinking there maybe hope the story line of the film is laughable at best with the acting so poor you just have to cringe the title zombie nation implies a hoard of zombies when in fact there are six in total this cannot be categorised as a horror film due to the introduction of cheesy music when the zombies attack the zombies actually talk and act like human beings in the film with the only difference being the make up which looks like something out a la roux video if you ever get the chance to buy this film then do so then burn the copy
i felt brain dead i'll tell you this is the worst film i have ever bought my ignorance i thought this was the peter jackson film of the same name the performances are so terrible they are laughable the special effects have not stood the test of time and look dire the script promotes that kind of tv movie stare into the middle distance kind of acting the cast look as if they have been taking lessons from joey tribbiani they have one look each and stick to it plus i have never been confused by a movie until i sat down to watch this the is it a dream or no plot is so terrible that frustration sets in within a few minutes avoid like a plague
a young scientist is trying to carry on his dead work on limb overbearing mother has convinced him that he murdered his own father and is monitoring his progress for her own evil young doctor uses reptilian dna he extracts from a large creature and when his arm is conveniently ripped off a few minutes injects himself with his formula and grows a new murderous the special effects in severed ties are pretty good and the rest of the film is severed arm is behaving like a snake and kills few acting is mediocre and the climax is out of
inept boring and incoherent supernatural thriller in which college student cassie sagemiller is the constant victim of hallucinations and nightmares after a car accident claims the life of her boyfriend sean can't begin to tell you how bad this of any importance ever happens nor is there ever any sort of actual entertainment value i did not like this cast in this particular film they are all sadly unconvincing again their roles are no good to promote this as a horror film is a joke where are the scares no sense or suspense there are a few good songs but about on earth did this project get the green light writer-director steve carpenter has no discernible vision or talent that i can sense worst of all the conclusion really makes the whole movie alleged killer cut that i watched is minutes of pure
i actually saw china o'brien ii before i ever saw the original china o'brien and i have to say that the first incarnation is actually worse but worse funnier and funnier better if you're a bad movie fan like i am this is great material if however you are looking for any sort of meaningful plot acting ability or movie-making skill this is best avoided the best part is how they filmed all the fighting sequences in stuttering fast-forward hilariously bad see it for a laugh see it for mindless entertainment but whatever you do see it for free on tv
i went to school with jeremy earl that is how i heard of this movie i don't really know if it was in the at all i don't recall the name i have seen it it is like one of those after school specials the acting is ok not great the plot was kind of weak and the lines were pretty corny so the only comment i can give this movie is eh i borrowed the movie from jeremy if i was in a movie rental place this is one that i would walk past and after watching it i wouldn't recommend it to anyone past middle school age i've also noticed that many times when urban kids are portrayed the slang is overused or just outdated many times i think thats what makes their characters unbelievable
we've all seen this story a hundred times you can see each plot turn coming a mile away the relationship between the mother and daughter is way too sweet and understanding to pass for realistic janet performance is stock southern ticket mother in vintage clothes should have been made for the lifetime channel
i should love this movie the acting is very good and barbara stanwyck is great but the the movie has always seemed very trite to me the movie makes working class people look low and cheap the fact that the daughter is ashamed of her mother and that the daughter does not rise above it has always made me a bit uneasy barbara stanwyck as the mother worships the daughter but the daughter forgoes a mothers love to find happiness with her well to do fathers family i wonder how many others who have seen this film feel this way about the acting was very very good and worth watching i really don't like the story line just a personal preference thank you
quite possibly the worst movie i've ever seen i was ready to walk out after the first ten minutes the only people laughing in the theater were the tweeners don't get me wrong i love silly stupid movies just as much as the next gal but the whole premise writing and humor stunk it seemed to me that they were going for a napoleon dynamite feel strange and random scenes which would lead to a cult audience instead it ended up being forced awkward and only bright light was isla fisher and i just felt utterly awful that she sissy spacek had signed up for this horrible gosh i didn't pay for it
falsely accused skirt-chasing chums john wayne john scott and eddy chandler kansas charlie change identities to become alias smith and jones mr wayne becomes john jones mr is supposed to be rev smith but wayne calls him dr smith at no time are either of them as entertaining as roger davis pete duel jonathan harris or ben murphy although wayne can be considered infinitely more successful than any of them career wise pretty blonde mary kornman anne grown-up from her days in our gang is a lovely interest for wayne she and chandler have a couple of cute scenes with wayne if you're not a fan of low budget john wayne films of the this movie won't make you one
this was no trainspotting or guy ritchie film it was a big wannabee it wanted to be an edgy nervous-laughter urban-life affirming film but more of a camera jerky mess a lot easier to imitate something else than to create a real story with real characters from the beginning i couldn't care less about the characters or what they were involved in they were always always hitting pissing or crying on each other only there wasn't any substance to what they were doing the dialog between characters is meant to be hip revealing instead it comes out trite and one scene after another is predictable i know there are viewers out there that really liked this movie so i could be wrong
i can't say that wargames the dead code is the worst movie i've ever seen as it had one or two decent moments but i can easily say the most transparent movie i've ever seen not once did a plot device present itself without me guessing it minutes in advance there was no subtlety to anything the movie did no intelligence evident at all behind the scenes every spoken or typed intent was so glaringly obvious it was impossible to get into the found myself laughing at the horribly thought out plot line and the bumbled attempts to reclaim the audience far more often than i found myself enjoying the movie
this was just horrible the plot was just ok but the rest of the was was bad i mean come on puppet and then they even tried to make the movie digital and that made it even worse normally i would like low-budget movie but this was just a waste of time and almost made me want to return the set that it came on i have about ten low-budget movie set with like movies on them and i would have to say this is the worse movie out of all of them also the wording is off and they use a fake plastic machetes that doesn't even look like a real one they could of used one that looked even a little close to a real one so save your time and money and don't watch this horrorible movie
strange i like all this movie crew and dark humor movies but didn't like this one at all awful horrible and surely not funny at all pity cannot do a whole movie plot disgust either and it was really boring long empty moments fills the movie it could have been removed it should have been in another shorter format surely maybe i expected too much from the crew like saving the movie lol also filled with overused clich√©s of characters and situations i don't get it why people liked it poetry hope nope mam didn't see anything like that all in all empty and crude pitiful and hopeless oh darn this one
this is another typical unbelievable and non-sensical piece of hollywood russell as snake pliskin in a business suit convinces me he was a better baseman ray liotta as the psychotic cop is totally predictable and absurd madeline stowe is her usual cardboard self and does little to be a convincing scene in this persiflage is absolutely predictable all the way to the end when kurt clouts ray with a vase or something knocking him down and out kurt and madeline then do their obligatory end-of-the-movie embrace and except russell and stowe knows liotta is going to get back up and menace the couple does of course and russell drills him times with his which was entirely unnecessary this movie could just as well ended with the bludgeoning except hollywood dotes on unnecessary violence and the more they can add or enhance the more slobbery they get
this movie has absolutely nothing good about it the acting is among the worst i have ever seen what is really amazing is that everyone is awful not just a few here and there everyone the direction is a joke the low budget is hopelessly evident the score is awful i wouldn't say the movie was edited brutally chopped would be a more appropriate phrase it combines serial killings voodoo and tarot cards dumb dumb dumb it is not scary at all the special effects are hopelessly lame laughably bad throughout the writing was appallingly bad the cinematography is real cheap looking and very grainy sometimes and the camera-work is dreadful again what really does the movie in is how badly all the actors are cheesy
brief summary this movie demeans everyone it touches that means off let me say i'm not a purist and this might have been funny for a few minutes the impersonations are not bad but overall just dull and excruciatingly not funny a few simple jokes are repeated over and over clear that this movies only exists to squeeze the last few dollars out of the now-trademarked laurel and hardy the producers cannot have any real regard for their place in film history or their talents this is what offended me the course my daughter liked it so i'm also a failure as a parent
i just sat in the theater bored as hell i wanted to leave halfway through the movie the plot is simple samoan guys wreck weddings so they have to bring a dates in order to get into the wedding thing that peeved me off the most was the so-called crude jokes they were highly unfunny clich√©d and thrown in your face to make you get into the already dull movie the acting was below-average and i felt this movie just went on and on about nothing but a bunch of unfunny jokes and a predictable in all one of the worse movies i've seen of unfunny bad acting just thank god a friend shouted me
amen to magsel there was a lot of confusion going on first off how do you know which movie you are purchasing henry cele stars in every one of them i bought this movie thinking it was the a letdown it would have been a comedy but for the young girl being raped david hasselhoff is ok for popcorn tv but he was not believable in this film was his english accent and with the love story the movie was supposed to be about a young rise to military power not the slave ship captain getting jiggly with the english maiden looking for her i had paid more than for this movie i would have to call the police because that would be a crime
i've just visited russian forum of our tv-channel that had showed this film well per cent of active russian audience is disappointed we wanted to see more true facts of our space achievements in this film but authors had in mind something else we are big and beautiful country with intelligent people living here we are proud of all our space dreams real achievements on the one hand in this field and in science on the other hand so i'd like to ask authors where is our lunohod and where the hell our mir station ah i'm quite sure that lunohod events took place much earlier walk on moon and to comment numerous technical and science mistakes i really have no time and enough space here se our constructive critics in russian forum on
this film is overblown predictable pretentious and hollow to its core the settings are faithful to the era but self-conscious in their magnification by prolonged exposure the lingering over artifacts stops the action and cloys almost as much as the empty dialogue tom hanks seems to be sleepwalking much as bruce willis did in war tom you can't give depth to a character simply by making your face blank the content did not warrant the histrionic acting by paul newman this is a dud wrapped in an atomic bomb casing
i don't recall walking out of a movie theater except this once not only that but i was with friends and we all wanted to go an uninteresting plot characters made of clay violence with no point i didn't care when the good guys died i didn't care when the bad guys got it the fantasy and magic was laid on thick as liver pudding and there was no coherency in short fine entertainment if you happen to be spending an eternity in hell
this was truly dreadful it had a terrible storyline was poorly acted and was like an amateur remake of evil dead but not nearly as took all my tenacity to make it through this one a good job i didn't have to visit the toilet else i doubt i would have come back this one makes hammer house of horror look like a big screen hollywood epic only value to this movie was the never ending supply of beautiful women not a bad one among them you want to letch with your friends after a night on the beer then this for you else avoid it like the plague
why the jane show won't work once again canadian bonehead producers and writers can't create a sitcom without putting some kind of different spin on it i guess these people don't watch a lot of from the which has the sitcom model down pat no here we have to do something different we have to make the a story absolutely absurd and then have a meaningful b story to try to make up for it the characters are two dimensional and the story lines are way over the top forklift races give me freaking break a little advice for the writers of the show don't write funny situations find the funny in situations and remember you have to be born with a sense of humor to write truly funny stuff not just be an improv monkey
a truly unpleasant film while rick special effects are quite impressive stomach-turning it has no other redeeming features like many movies it leaves you feeling as if you need to take a long shower and scrub the slime off of yourself the characters are uniformly unpleasant and plot makes no sense
i was a huge fan of the original cartoon series and was looking forward to finally seeing gadget on the big screen but i never in my wildest dreams expected something so extremely extremely terrible the pace was way too fast there was no plot and wowser what the hell is that it was wowsers
the premise is amazing and the some of the acting notably sally kellerman and anthony rapp is charming but this film is near unwatchable the music sounds as if it comes from some sort of the royalty free online site and the lyrics as if they were written with a rhyming dictionary open on the lap most of the singing is off-key i think they may have filmed with the singing accapella and put in the music under it the dialogue is really stupid and trite the movie works best when it is actually talking about the real estate but unfortunately it strays to often into stupid farcical sub-plots i found myself checking my watch after ther first twenty minutes and after wondering when is it ever going to end
wow i don't even really remember that much about this movie except that it basically a parents neglect her so this sicko pokemon pretends to be her dad am i the only one disturbed by that then this weirdo pokemon kidnaps mom to pretend to be the i don't care if he was trying to make the girl happy just was no real plot the girl was just a whiny brat who wanted things her own way she played with unowns was the daughter of entei and apparently could grow and shrink in age on a whim with the help of her pretty much all i can remember but i think you can take it as a hint and not see it if you do see it don't expect much out of if you want a pokemon movie rent pokemon the first movie
the pallbearer is a disappointment and at times extremely boring with a love story that just doesn't work partly with the casting of gwyneth paltrow gwyneth paltrow walks through the entire film with a confused look on her face and its hard to tell what david schwimmer even sees in the pallbearer at times is funny particularly the church scene and the group scenes with his friends are a laugh but basically it watch the pallbearer for those scenes only and fast forward the rest trust me you aren't missing much
this movie commits what i would call an emotional rape on the viewer the movie supposedly caused quite a stir among the critics in cannes but for me the final scene was just a pathetic attempt for a newbie director to get himself noticed hardly a voice in the discussion on the issue of violence drug abuse or juvenile delinquency any other issue for that main metamorphosis from good but troubled boy to the vicious rapist is virtually nonexistent whereas the rape scene an over-dragged exaggerated version of the rape scene from a clockwork orange is unbearable and i refuse to comment on its aesthetic values there are some things an artist should not do to try and achieve goal at least in my wrap it up shockingly brutal revolting and not worth your time see a clockwork orange or le pianiste instead
demi character in the movie was selected for the seals because of her looks that was a bad start and the movie went down from there the plot was totally unbelievable the will to make it in a tough military unit is not enough this movie did not convince me of a physical ability to perform the types of tasks to pretend that women and men are basically the same is an insult to intelligence the differences between the sexes are what makes life interesting
proof that not everything tarantino touches turns to gold this is most definitely plastic all the way its easy to see that without involvement this would have probably sat on the shelf for years assuming it would have ever got produced in the first place it is about a woman with a fascination of death who gets a job cleaning up after crime scenes angela jones is unconvincing in this role william baldwin is better as the serial killer who keeps jones in employment all in all pretty poor
brokedown palace is not the kind of movie i would ever like to see i also did not like the movie when some aussie man smuggled drugs in thailand and accused claire danes and kate beckinsale of drug smuggling i would not go to that country no matter what after i saw this movie in fact this movie stinks i prefer to visit germany to meet beautiful single women germany is the country i tolerate i also would rather stick to the united states instead after i saw some of the movie in the theatre including the false accusation of drug smuggling i left the theatre and had my money refunded because i cannot tolerate this movie if you are going to to thailand to meet someone there who could be a drug smuggler forget this
the monster from enemy mine somehow made his way into a small mountain community where he has taken up residence being hunted by a female doctor-turned-vigilante who is out to exterminate him this female assassin who looks like a refugee from a motley crue video rides around on a motorcycle and tries to save a bunch of kids who have chosen to have a big chill weekend right smack dab in the middle of the turf decapitations and lots of blood are primarily in place to draw attention away from the story which limps along like a bad version of the island of dr moreau yes worse than the one with val kilmer
really an amazing pile of pap predictable slow moving soul destroying mind numbing movie to which slitting your own wrists with a rusty bread knife seems well almost acting is over done for the thin dialogue every scene is at least twice as long as it needs to be the intricate details of how this career is collapsing or that career is rising is just far too dreary and mundane for words the music would be good if you didn't have to sit through the movie but really three good songs is not enough reward for the effort required to watch the this film i prayed to god for narcolepsy or for someone to shoot ever ever again
this movie is simply not worth the time or money spent full of clich√©s and a plot that makes absolutely no sense i cant believe that so many people have given this awful movie a my guess is they are stooges of the movie maker i could give this movie a zero i would too bad imdb doesn't allow that only reason i watched it because i went with a friend who really wanted to see it whats sad is that i never had great expectations from this movie to begin with and yet i felt short changed take my word don't waste your on this piece of trash the only entertainment i got out of the movie was making fun of the directors name in all highly not recommended
a very bad attempt at a young spinal tap at least the music in spinal tap was is really a very sad case of hollywood nepotism at worst a bunch of hollywood execs bad musicians and producers create some poopie show so their kids can be in the spotlight oh please the potty humor was even bad i hate this stuff when there is really incredibly talented kids actors and artists out there busting their butts to have success and this crap comes u all why wasn't gene simmons in it taste in entertainment is going down the toilet
i went to see this movie at our college theater thirty years ago because i liked bruce dern in silent running and family plot to this day jack nicholson it is still the dullest movie i've ever seen it just went on and on with no discernible point and then it just ended the lights came up and i watched everyone looking around in confusion had the projectionist missed a reel i've never had the urge to find out all i remember about the movie is that it was a non-drama about some annoying college basketball players and their coach the most enjoyable part of the movie was watching the totally mystified audience afterwords fortunately this was just an exception for jack bruce and karen black
i've seen a lot of crap in my day but goodness hot rod takes the cake i saw a free screening in ny the other night i can only hope they show the funny version to the paying customers the big laughs were sparse the plot was uninteresting and the characters were one dimensional at best one highlight is a hilarious dancing scene with adam samberg it was priceless and was the only scene i truly had a hearty laugh at other than that i can only recollect randomness and dead air snl samberg fans may be disappointed i know i was expecting more from it but it short i definitely would not recommend attending a free screening or paying to watch this film
i gave this movie a very fair chance and it betrayed me this is very little more than a black and white excuse to bore the hell out of the audience even as the egotist bogdanavich did way better with targets gets great performances out of a ton of hams in their debuts lots of teenage sex clich√©s come out of this movie such as doing the wife impotence doing the ugly is very awkwardly shot and grinds things to a complete halt not that things were really going anywhere anyway and skinny suppose this movie is supposed to be funny because of all the sex nonsense to me it was just annoying i was seriously much more entertained by cleaning my finger nails than watching this mess
from the awful death scenes to guns that fire without making sounds to a character called the fiend all tiresome slow moving unimaginative drivel it was ok seeing the guy with the cape and the hunchback lurking around visually it was creepy and probably occupied the moviegoer of the time but even in one would think that there would have been a little more imagination and verisimilitude to even a film like this i just kept waiting for something to happen of any importance as people stood around making speeches and acting like they were posing at an office picnic and then there are those bullets as a previous commentator mentioned perhaps the best clue would have been to search for a water spot on pants pocket
i caught this movie on fx last night and as i was sitting there watching it it occurred to me that it could quite possibly be the worst movie ever bad acting bad cinematography bad sound totally unbelievable fight sequences stupid characters all these made it up to be the most laughably bad movie i've ever seen it was so bad i was enthralled by sheer lack of anything semi-competent that i had to keep watching and they made a sequel
gorgeous bodies gorgeous colors and camera work pretentious dialog banal plot the name of the prima donna camilla and the eponymous flowers that appear frequently are enough to remind us of the plot similarities from dumas novel la dame aux camelias the movie camille starring garbo and think robert taylor and last but not least opera la traviata beautiful not-too-virtuous young ladies social outcasts for one reason or another loved split up reunited just in time to die of tuberculosis in the last scene one forgives banal plots and stupid unrealistic dialog in opera but why waste hayak don sutherland a beautiful rendition of la in the a deus ex machina earthquake that conveniently kills the other woman and all that beauty on this mediocre turkey where there isn't even any beautiful singing
okay so i went into this movie not really expecting much i figured an action flick similar to the fast and the furious some nice cars some nice girls somewhat of a decent plot unfortunately i would have to say that this was probably the worst movie i have seen this year don't get me wrong the cars were nice and the girls were ok but the way they put the movie together was just plain crappy to put it nicely the story just never made you care about the cast and the movie seemed just pieced together so overall this movie was not the worst thing ever by far but if your looking for a movie to go to this weekend i would pass on this one for now
this oddity in the new doris day collection doesn't really need to be included as she is only in the film for less than minutes what she does do however is shine when on screen the near plot less movie is just an excuse to showcase some warner contract players of the day jancie rule shows promise and a shame she didn't become a big star ruth roman handles the role of the go-getter with aplomb better if this was in color the travis air force base locations with some rear projection work well best about the movie are some wonderful musical interludes if you enjoyed thank your lucky stars and hollywood canteen you'll like this one
it happened with assault on prescient in it happened with the lost boys in and now happened with another classic from the wargames why oh why oh why won't hollywood ever learn leave them alone they can't be remade they suck we all hate of you who haven't seen the original version with matthew broderick ally sheedy go it now the hardware may look dated the special effects are not new millennium but it still beats this rubbish hands those of us who lived through the when hacking was sexy the internet was something mysterious and your disks came as a floppy variety well we now possess the wisdom to avoid this film like a thermonuclear war before has a nice game of chess seemed the better option
unless you are mentally ill or the most die hard segal fan you will tire of this horrendous excuse for a film in under plot even for a seagal film the plot is just stupid i mean its not just bad its barely acting unbelievably wooden literally seen better acting in ironically this film tries to cash in on this audience which a lesbian love scene which is utterly effects wouldn't look out of place in a sword and sorcery you suffer from insomnia and have exhausted all other cures don't make the same mistake as i did and buy this dvd as you will be asking for that hour and a half of your life back
why o why did i pick this one up well i needed a no-brainer in the summer heat and the cover looked course i should've known better this is a really really bad movie and it gets embarasing when the makers know bad and try cover it up by adding some women and some sex-scenes to it well folks it does'nt cut it does you would like a cool movie about a big reptile that is actually very very good well-played and funny go rent lake placid is an order
this is a genuinely horrible film the plot as it is is totally undecipherable think it has something to do with blackmail but i'm not entirely of the dialogue consists of useless cliches the other half is spoken by the various actors in such unintelligible imitations of southern accents that the words cannot be the one true tragedy of the movie is that such a historic talent as mary tyler moore apparently was in such dire financial or personal circumstances that she appeared in
relentlessly stupid no-budget war picture made mainly to show off the attributes of the spectacular eve a bad idea in that should be an embarrassment to everyone connected with it laughable script performances that wouldn't pass muster in an elementary-school christmas pageant inept action scenes confused direction by the normally competent documentary director louis clyde is apparently not quite sure if making a comedy a philosophical treatise on the futility of war or a leering early standards anyway travelogue of eve magnificent a general air of shoddiness and incompetence worth seeing in order to watch eve meyer strut her stuff but pretty much it
i bought this movie from discount used movie bin and the cover caused me to laugh uncontrollably so i bought it for the movie itself is retarded and they use like ten different monkeys throughout the whole film that hardly look alike not to mention they use a stunt double who is just a short guy in costume making a desperate attempt to impersonate a director more than likely committed a murder-suicide with the chimpanzees after the movie debuted in a preview for some other low rent warner bros film and he ended up owing money to the studio it also doesn't help that he wasn't even infamous for the terrible job he did he wasn't even known for producing a poop-chute was this movie ever made
after i watched this movie i came to imdb and read some of the reviews which compared it to lost in translation lite when i read that i immediately could see the reviewers movie was a poor attempt at a similar theme interestingly the format of the movie is nearly identical but the pacing is incredibly different items rushes the viewer through the time line of the movie whereas the better-planned lost in seems to stretch out over a few long sure some people will see this because it has morgan freeman and will be disappointed it seems his better roles now-a-days are supporting roles in big blockbusters rather than leading roles in limited release movies and indie films
has to be one of the worst wastes of movie film ever unleashed on the public the sequel to the at least entertaining pseudo-documentary original film the legend of boggy creek bad script worse acting etc etc dawn wells had to be hoping that gilligan would come rescue her and take her back to the island just to escape from this piece of clap-trap
when i rented this movie i had very low when i saw it i realized that the movie was less lot less than what i expected the actors were bad wife was one of the worst the story was so could work for a disney movie for the murders but this one is not a comedy it is a laughable masterpiece of stupidity the title is well chosen except for one thing they could add stupid movie after dead husbands i give it and a half out of
from the what was she thinking file whoopi goldberg plays a cop in the future who is teamed with a talking dinosaur for a crime case involving a madman who wants to start another ice-age straight-to-tape oddity is embarrassing and ridiculous a high-concept in search of itself apparently this was a labor of love for its writer-director jonathan betuel also served as one of the producers sadly the end results are anemic to be charitable mere presence on-screen can often spark good will and laughter no matter how poor the script but here drowning and you can see the unfunny results no stars from
in the first one it was mainly giant rats but there were some wasps and a giant chicken too this one however is just giant rats period well giant rats and one really growing little boy this one is about this growing boy and a scientist that is trying to help him so he accidentally creates giant killer know how it is this movie has some kills and its moments but i find it to be on par with the original i just prefer some variety in my giant creature movies well that is not actually like empire of the ants maybe i just do not care for giant rodents all in all a rather drab movie though it does have one rather odd turn of events in this one dream sequence that is truly bizarre i just can't recommend this one
let me count the a title-only remake that pulls out every clich√© in the slasher a plot so predictable that it becomes quite a completely weak execution of all attempts at suspense or a rating that insures no gore violence or a villain that is not frightening or even a cast of characters that are so thinly written and stereotyped that we couldn't possibly care about a lack of any effectively creepy atmosphere unlike the original prom a script of dialog beyond poor mind numbing a series of cardboard performances sure whether to blame the actors or the lousy aforementioned script for a completely inept teen-targeted slasher remake not brave enough to attempt to have an imagination or even to show a puddle of a no-brainer horror fans save your out of
acclaimed japanese director takashi miike can't seem to get the wheels moving with this torpid thriller an adaptation of yasushi book concerning an evil old woman child abuser who is part of a new urban legend if your cell-phone rings with a strange you see the message one missed will replay the message only to hear your own final words before your death most successful part of the film is the trenchant satire of reality tv cameras intruding on the future victims but the not-so-elaborate deaths include a hidden piece of red candy are disappointing and dispiriting the frequent shots of ravaged dead bodies are actually displayed rather discreetly and this overall politeness may be the reason why the film is ultimately so staid hollywood predictably jumped on the far-fetched plot in yet the version fared no better no stars from
mind my friends and i saw the movie based off title alone cute though obvious in plot and you know where the movie is going within the first five minutes my main contention with the plot is that while it remains tolerably consistent they never explain a lot of the things behind the characters an alcoholic father overworked mother stressed-out sister a bad family but aside from the occasional mention from the sister not any resolution i was also confused as to the scene with the bottles it seemed pretty writing is a secondary concern the kids weren't bad actors but their script left a lot to be desired unfortunately what could have been a cute niche movie was pushed aside for a single blah special effect lame scripting and a glaringly obvious plot
okay i've seen lots and i do mean lots of these types of films you know the ones where the dvd cover just look so good and scaarrryyy that you just cant wait to see it well i got got again and i'm getting pretty tired of it but i digress pretty simple it know rather juvenile but it did andi so agree with the other poster that if we had to sit through the boring thing why oh why did the lead actress have to be so so if i may add and the scowl she used convey unresolved over the death of her daughter did little help i mean jesus oh but the crawling-on-her-back-demon thingee was pretty neat
another of many nearly forgotten movies cranked out by poverty row in the resurrected by the magic of stock universal player lionel atwill a supporting actor in numerous frankenstein movies as a pair of twins involved in a murder racket one kills the victims involved in a scam and asks witnesses for the exact time while the other is deaf and is proved innocent because he could not have spoken to course where it falls apart is if it was a congenital deafness wouldn't they both be deaf oh does a pretty good job here faking being deaf and mute unfortunately no one else here can really act worth a darn
in basically the same they couldn't even get the time line of events that was intentional due to laziness or not thing is a real doesn't even deserved to be called a viewed this as a so called second feature on the disc containing the original the thought my head would i urge you to run as far in the opposite direction of this you should be cursed with the misfortune of combing across should come with a warning label cause your to drop several points if you are within no doubt this thing is a
this is supposed to be well-researched and based on fact how come therefore that so packed with mcgovernisms did the people of derry live in some kind of bizarre philip k dick world in which reality was uncannily like priest or is mcgovern an idle hack who just keeps repeating hims
this movie is a good example of how to ruin a book in minutes except for the names of the characters the movie bears very little resemblance to the book a book full of strong latino characters and they are represent for the most part by non-latinos there is no character development in the movie and we have no reason to love or hate the characters and to delete a complete generation is inexcusable isabel allende has written a powerful book and the book is what should be read
the idea was awesome the actors were incredible the story could of been very scary but the writing was poor and there was no depth i couldn't really get into this movie i couldn't feel for the characters there were a lot of cliffhangers and the movie just ends very weirdly was it a happy ending i don't know was it a sad ending again i don't know you leave the theater feeling unsatisfied the movie had so much to give but couldn't just because you can edit doesn't mean you should right i wouldn't really recommend this movie because you just can't say that you left the movie feeling like it was completed you'll just be confused trust me you will probably thank me if you don't watch this
i feel totally ripped off someone needs to refund the i spent at blockbuster to rent this homemade mess this is not a musical it is a complete waste of time and my evening what i don't get is why did this get distributed in the first must have been doing some heavy drugs the night that deal was made i've seen better films come out of film schools and i have been to film school so i can say that as a fact the quality of this work is also just so very bad to on dv nuff said the songs are not songs but just banter that sounds the same in every section want to see a good musical then don't rent this movie
one of those dramas so bad that it almost hits the point of being very funny the script is absolutely dire direction appalling lighting purely armature the only thing letting it down from a true so bad good feel is that the sound design is only quite bad it adds no suspense to the story although trying hard but doesn't at least destroy any speeches continuity problems of seasons of out door shots throughout and finally last but not least the acting is appalling for a professional production it very much has the feel of a university media project you have to feel sorry for the sorry for anyone who had to put their names to this
having seen triumph of the will i can only say this movie is ghastly even measured against the historically low standards of the time naturally all totally fabricated and prejudicial this is what one would expect of german propaganda unfortunately the quality of the presentation itself is hackneyed and cheap also so blatantly ridiculous that even contemporary germans must've left the theater holding their noses in a genre renowned for its base appeal lack of originality and unapologetic wrong-headedness this film doesn't even qualify as bad it would have to improve significantly to attain that status
there is no doubt that this film has an impressive cast but unfortunately this doesn't help with the major downsides to the movie i never understand why directors ask to use accents not their own when it is obvious to everyone they can't convince fiennes just can't do irish and fitzgerald isn't much better at russian when the voice is wrong then no matter how good the acting the character will never be convincing as the for the major there one i guess there was some sort of storyline involved but it was so full of holes that i just couldn't wait for the film to was ridiculous save minutes of your life and don't watch this movie
there is good there is bad and then their is the sentinel a bottom-barrel political thriller that ranks among the worst movies i have ever seen the plot of a mole in the secret service is a good one but never has a movie with so much potential been so utterly butchered directed with ham-handed edginess by clark johnson every actor in this film seems to be working on autopilot even the great michael douglas looks bored here i can honestly say i have never in all my life viewed another film with so many glaring plot holes the twist is predictable from square one and the motives are so utterly ridiculous that they inspired laughter from the audience avoid this at all costs this is a catastrophe of a movie with no redeeming value
it is so sad even though this was shot with film i think it stinks a little bit more than flicks like blood lake nothing out there the music they play in this is the funniest stuff i've ever heard i like the brother and sister in this movie they both don't try very hard to sound sarcastic when they're saying stuff like my friends are going to be so jealous hey whats with the killer only wearing his mask in the beginning thats retarded i practically ignored the second half of this my favorite part about this movie is the sound effect they use when the killer is using the axe the same exact sound for every chop
imagine a woman alone in a house for forty five minutes in which absolutely nothing happens then this goes on twice more the writing is flat and lifeless and jokes unfunny and the bad acting keeps you from caring about any of the characters even when they battle wolf packs and get beaten up by fraternity goons anyone that ranked this movie higher than a two is not fully sane
the movie is just as fun as staring at the pataki is a total retard that loves nothing better to do than sit on his fat rear making a smoke ring from his puffy cigars and drinking booze while the doctor acts like a zombie version of nicholas cage sucking up all that so called blood which in reality seemed like fruit of all the plotting seemed very horrid to even call this piece of crap a rest of the characters in this movie are total wastes of time the ending was awful the outlines were cheesy and the scenes were terrible what else more should i say to you viewers out there my advice would be to get your rabies shot if you've already watched the movie this movie may give you the foam in the mouth if you didn't get your up-to-date shots
when you go at an open air cinema under the greek summer night you usually don't care what the movie is edison started really good with some good effort from the singers-who-want-to-be actors and a once again great morgan freeman but a movie there is usually a good start to catch a bit boring yet story filling middle of the movie that is more about characters and less about action done and the third part is something really good so that you can remember the movie when you see elite police officers with weapons that can demolish a building shoot at a guy behind a car fail to hit him even once while he kills all and then the guy takes out a flame thrower kill the rest you realise that the greek summer sky filled with stars is way too good to be distracted by a movie like this
well i like to be honest with all the audiences that i bought it because of sex scenes but unfortunately i did not see much of them all sex scenes were short and done in haphazard manner along with all the weird and corny background music just like all other b movies it just doesn't look much like two people having sex there is a tiny bit of plot toward the end new lover is a killer whoa how shocking why don't we nominate this movie for oscar award i can't imagine how bad the movie would look like if it were r-rated is imported from uk rated conclusion put it down and walk away so yon won't end up with being a moron like
now don't get me wrong i do enjoy christmas movies i love its a wonderful life and i really enjoy the versions of a christmas carol with george c scott and alistair sim but this particular movie is awful i think the i love life song the ghost of christmas present sings is especially painful albert finney sings fairly well in annie i don't know whats wrong with him in this movie but it sounds as though someone is trying to sing through a mouthful of dead gerbils the only thing that saved this movie for us was shutting the sound off and watching the dance numbers accompanied by the south park christmas cd
i borrowed this movie from library think it might be delightful how wrong am is such a bad movie that i have to write something about it mira sorvino is so bad in the movie it is very painful to watch the scene with her she is a pretty girl but in this movie she is not seductive at all but i will have to witness her awkward attempt to seduce almost all the other major characters it is so the dialog of the film is so pretentious and lack the humorous fact that make then failure
you know you're in trouble when the opening narration basically tells you who survives it all goes downhill from there unnecessary bullet-time camera work pointless cuts to video game footage crusty old sea captains and wacky seamen ravers who become skilled combatants in the blink of an eye even the zombies are was hoping for at least a so bad good zombie movie but this one is so bad those involved with its creation should be barred from ever making a movie
an interesting little movie that strictly gives the phrase low budget a horrible name our physics teacher who has about nine kids creates a strange serum that causes molecular reorganization students are hopelessly killed from fake coincidences of submarine sandwiches and flying school supplies sounds like a resurrection of classic b-movies from the right nope not an example of high camp fun which is way way off the mark a glamorous showcase of breasts and butts ensues our desire for pleasure opposing the horror that should have had more in the first place bottom-of-the-barrel entertainment at its best aided by pints of red blood and dead student bodies atrocious movies like this would make the ultimately catastrophic guru the mad monk the work of an intelligent genius who has a degree in film production an automatic f so rest easy
this foolish implausible tale is redeemed only by the opening scene in which a hard-boiled police detective delivers some nearly-audible lines confirming our greatest fears he is dead perhaps the film would have been saved had the director forgone the dazzling star power of a martinez in favor of this sadly-anonymous actor who filled the screen for a brief moment that a no-name hack-tor off the street could salvage such a dishwater film is no less likely than a villain committing murder by dropping stones into a quarry for an unsuspecting diver his moment is brief his promise is immense perhaps we will be treated to more screen time by this obscure thespian if there is ever a sequel to this ill-advised film
how this piece of garbage was put to film is beyond me the only actor who is at all known to me is judge reinhold an accomplished actor whose presence is merely a justification for putting it into don't even think it is worth a nomination for a rotten tomato award this film really does make b movies a cinematic enjoyment a car travelling along the freeway with police in tow and no one knows how to stop the car yeah script must have been written on the back of a cigarette carton most made for tv movies are awful but this redefines the word check out the acting skills of the bridge operator pure oscar material
the cover of the box makes this movie look really good don't be fooled splatter university came out in which was the last good year for horror but this movie sucks the characters are so annoying only the teacher is cool there is like no plot to this movie who the hell would ever produce this waste of a up teacher dies in this and it was a female we all know that we must have a female surviver if you're going to break the rules do it in a good horror flick not this waste
first let me say that i am not a dukes fan but after this movie the series looked like law and order the worst thing was the casting of roscoe and boss hogg burt reynolds is not boss hogg and even worse was gainey as roscoe if they ever watched the show roscoe was not a hard ass cop he was more a barney fife than the role he played in this movie is loaded with the usual errors cars getting torn up and continues like nothing happened the worst example of this is when the the general gets together with billy prickett and the general is ran into a dirt hill obviously slowing to a near stop but goes on to win the race
although i recently put this on my worst films list i have to say probably no worse than burt reynolds in the maddening or any of the look talking sequels still pretty nauseating even with sexy drew barrymore playing something of a horror-movie answer to holly golightly relocating from new york city to los angeles but finding out being stalked by a murderous look-alike poor sally kellerman a quirky actress of great acclaim in the is reduced here to a paltry supporting role and leading man george newbern is the worst type of sitcom actor always pausing for a laugh after every line the picture is swill but bloody shower scene boasts showmanship and the identity of the psycho right out of a scooby doo episode is interesting but as for the real who had to clean up that mess from
this film is about a male escort getting involved in a murder investigation that happened in the circle of powerful thought the walker would be thrilling and engaging but i was so wrong the pacing is painfully and excruciatingly slow that even after minutes of the film nothing happens much seriously the first hour could be condensed into ten minutes how slow it fact that it lacks any thrills or action scenes aggravates the boredom almost shocking that even argument scenes are so plain and devoid of emotion maybe it is because of the stiff upper lip of the higher social class sad that the walker becomes such a boring mess despite such a strong cast blame it on the poor plot and even worse pacing
quote theurgist anyone with an over would have seen this film what it is an intelligent well acted prequel to a modern day classic yes it doesn't have a blockbuster cast or a huge budget but it is still very well done and had me hooked for the full over you say that most mean you have an lower than its name is carlitos way rise to power meaning it should have something whit the first one to do and all its a ok movie if you change the title and no characters named carlito don't comment on a movie if you don't know anything about movies but i guess an under you wont know what the hell i am yelling out
this is an interesting idea gone bad the hidden meanings in art left as clues by a serial killer sounds intriguing but the execution in anamorph is excruciatingly slow and without much interest there is no other way to describe the film except boring the death clues are the only interesting part of anamorph everything connecting them is tedious willem dafoe gives a credible performance as the investigator but he has little to do with a script that is stretched to the limit several supporting character actors are wasted including peter stormare as the art expert james rebhorn as the police chief paul lazar as the medical examiner and most notably deborah harry who is featured on the back of the dvd case yet only has a couple lines spoken through a cracked door not recommended merk
when i saw this movie i couldn't believe my eyes where these hilarious creatures dustbin muppets with big pointy teeth really meant to be scary or where they designed to have a good laugh sincerely hope so if you watch carefully you can even see the strings operating them dragging them across the screen the whole was rather funny than scary and i had a good time watching the movie because i was amazed by its overall incapacity to have only one good part it is one big joke from beginning to end and i believe this movie belongs into a new category so unbelievable crappy you'll be laughing from beginning to end not even gonna try to comment on the acting or all the other things
maybe this isn't fair because i only made it about halfway through the movie one of the few movies i have actually not been able to watch due to acting is terrible the camera work is terrible the plot is ridiculous and the whole movie is just unrealistic and cheesy for example during a coke deal the coke is just kept loose in a briefcase i'm no expert but i think people generally put it in a use the same stupid sound effect whenever a punch is thrown that over the top crunching sound and they use toy guns with dubbed in sound movie ever
i sincerely consider this movie as another poor effort of dominican movie industry the first minutes of the movie are a little funny but then when they switch their role in the society doing what women usually do and women doing what men usually do the movie falls becoming boring and not funny at all they let many things without explanation and the end of the movie is predictable i didn't like the way as a roberto angel played his character and his little either i went to the movies theater hoping to see a good work but i went out really don't recommend this movie
maximally manipulative anabel sims drake sets out to trap her ideal man aided by her co-worker julie esteemed pediatrician madison brown grant goes from bemused to betrothed in the space of minutes on film but to the viewer all eternity can a movie receive less than one star this one is a prime candidate
avoid this crap at all costs bad script bad directing bad acting bad editing bad sound and bad music get the idea this movie tries to be western flavored not it tries to be hard core violent not it tries to present a fresh look at an old genre it doesn't the actors try there best and my heart goes out to them but with such inane material to work with hard to make something shine to me this has all of the looks of a fresh outta film school gonna set the world on fire first attempt freshmen film makers often bite off more that they or their budget can chew the best thing they can do is to take a few steps back reassess what is possible and work within their limited budget the next time out
i saw the omen when i was on tv i enjoyed the trilogy so when the chance to finally see one at the cinema came around i didnt pass it up i went in to the cinema knowing that what i was about to see wasnt a cinema release but a made for tv film however being a fan i couldnt resist but this omen movie which i saw at a midnight screening didnt bring chills it brought laughter risible dialogue such as it is written that if a baby cries during baptism they reject there god what decent set pieces faye grant so good in v is wasted with this script from hell no suprises and no fun however i did laugh out loud several times at our bad it out of
jimmy dean could not have been more hammy or absurdly loutish hysterical if viewed through the eyes of mystery science theatre which i rate as a i mean the sight of this obese corn-fed hog trouncing around malta should be enough to send you to the vomitory if you make it that far into the film this ugly hysterical farce should be placed with the likes of booty call pumpkinhead swarm and the smurfs go to bangladesh a film like this proves that sometimes actors writers producers etc get behind on their mortgage or get stoned to the point of insanity it begs the question who was so stupid to finance such a whale but then had good judgment prevailed and final justice never was then we wouldn't have the delightful spoof voice-over in mystery science theatre
i didn't enjoy this movie at just found it crude and no also felt movie really doesn't appear to be about i didn't find any of the characters there doesn't seem to be any point to it i'm missing for movie is pretty much a waste of i could have been doing something more productive and using my face as a pin garner is in this are howell and shirley james are wasted i'm sure this was a low point in each of their respective the later years of also in the it is nice to see her in a non ditsy other than can't rise above the mediocre is a
the story is very trustworthy and powerful the technical side of the movie is quite fine even the directing of it the main problem is with the castings that turned that movie into almost another local and regular clich√© with a great lack of impact and even greater lack of impression beside the small role of the father rafael impressively by asi dayan all other actors were unfortunately not in their best the role of the elder blind girl played by taly sharon was fresh but without any intensity as the leading role therefore the figure she acted had become mild and low profile there were moments and episodes that looked more like a rehearsal then a real movie but after all a good point to begin from and to make big improvements in the future
this is the worst thing the tmnt franchise has ever spawned i was a kid when this came out and i still thought it was deuce even though i liked the original this one scene i remember when the mafia ape guy explains to his minions what rhetorical questions are atrocious many fans hate on the series for including a female turtle but that didn't bother me so much so that i didn't even remember her until i read about the show recently all in all miserably only okay thing was the theme song guilty pleasure they call it nananana ninja
main question i pose concerning this film is how do you film a cole porter musical and only use of his songs merman and lahr played the lead roles on broadway here they are replaced by the weaker red skelton and lucille ball plot changes abound and the fun is it
be warned this movie tells lots of love stories without any only intention of this movie seems to be showing love in many different story has only a few minutes so there is no development of characters and nearly no plot just an sketchy idea of a plot the writer tried to build in turning points that aimed to surprise the viewer however that just didn't work out because you didn't get to know the characters in before or these jokes were just is a movie about love that fails to reach your heart a dozen times or even more i don't know and i don't care
this is the worst adaption of a classic story i have ever seen they needlessly modernize it and some points are actually just songs rarely move along the story they seem to be thrown in at random the flying scene with marley is pointless and not only one of the worst movies i've seen but it is definitely the worst musical i've ever probably only considered a classic because a christmas carol is such a classic story just because the original story was a classic doesn't mean that some cheap adaption is
you can give jms and the boys a pass on this one because they were at the beginning of their series and on a small budget but the movie is still sub-par dont get me wrong the series is by far the best tv series ever but if i was an exec seeing this movie i wouldnt have ordered the series i dont like o'hare as an actor the costumes are silly and there are tons of cliches the same can be said for most of the first season the exception of babylon squared and survivors bruce immediately put a fire into the series and it went on to be an amazing spectacle if you are a fan and havent seen this movie see it if you arent a fan wont want to watch the series
this was not enjoyable to watch frank puts all his dreams on the back burner and gets a normal job just so his stepson can go to film school but his stepson decides that he'll make a humiliating documentary about the man instead a documentary filmmaker should point the camera and simply shoot not manipulate and comment with snide captions the bitterness and resentment of the filmmaker towards his stepfather is obvious and sad the goal seems to be to make frank appear dumb and pathetic instead he comes across as the most human of the people a smear campaign all dressed up as something much smarter and edgier than it really is it left me with an intense dislike for the filmmaker
most book adaptations are bad but this film left out key parts of the storyline and changed the description and some characters they rewired the storyline and combined scenes and changed the order they added ridiculous things into it that never happened in the book and would never i hadn't read the book beforehand it would have been an incredibly dull film it didn't make you care about the characters like them or dislike them it turns the characters into of two hours of my life
this film is a pure failure i am a steve martin fan but even he can't save the tired idea and swiss cheese script think police academy and apply it to a military parody do not feel the other user comments reflected the poor rating this film received rightfully deserved it is extremely misleading i have often seen this film marked down to in the grocery store and now i certainly know only i could get my minutes back
in paperhouse was hailed as a thinking horror film wow you might say sign me up this thing is a mess it features a one time young actress who has a range of like to g headley with a bad british accent and a story with no chills thrills or isn't even interesting psycho-babble one will only laugh at its cheap effects and long for a showing of leprechaun story involves a girl with glandular fever who escapes in her dreams what you get isn't good horror art house or even a decent after-school special i found myself after the two hour point did my two hours direction is uninspired and i wished it could even be seems like the producers were on in the dream world things are short no on this one
a worn-out plot of a man who takes the rap for a woman in a murder case the equally worn-out plot of an outsider on the inside who eventually is shut such an outstanding case one would think the film would rise above its hackneyed origins but scene after scene drones by with no change in intensity no character arcs and inexplicable homosexuality theme was completely unnecessary or on the other hand completely unexplored it seemed to be included only to titillate the viewers when will hollywood learn that having gay characters does not automatically make a more compelling regrettably dreadful movie when will lauren bacall pick a good one i expected better of her and kristin scott thomas this one is definitely one to miss
why was this film made even keeping in mind the generous tax concessions that australian film investors were given there can be no reasonable explanation for this film being given the go-ahead for goodness sakes the actors cast in this film are aussie b-grade celebs actors people like john michael hollywood howson the original drummer from the band in hey hey its saturday and the voice-over guy in countdown but in saying that this is still very watchable as long as you give it the brain attention it deserves none the script is bad for a self-confessed b-grade horror and the acting and film quality is worse it often looks as though it is a home movie but even a home movie has realism anyone interested in australian cinema please for the love of god pretend this film was never made
no spoilers here but i have been a fan since waking the dead started but the last series of which only have been on so far is awful the stories bear no resemblance to the original idea of the series i found these in the last series jaw droppingly ludicrous as a bbc licence payer after the show i rang bbc complaints to pass on my disappointment i'm amazed that actors of the calibre of trevor eve and sue johnstone didn't object to the story lines these actors have been with these characters for seasons surly they can see lost all direction a good job it is the last series or the next series may start with the team investigating the death of father bentley west yorkshire england
if i had realized john wayne was in this movie i would not have watched it demeaning to the japanese unfortunate for hollywood and embarrassing to any thinking person but then most john wayne movies are like that hollywood in the fifties still believed that everybody in the world loved americans when the truth was still is somewhat different the movie deals with the nineteenth century isolationism of japan maybe hollywood that should be put it as succinctly as possible this film is appalling jingoistic of a madama butterfly with bad music
early film directed by griffith it features a gloriously happy king v johnson and his queen leonard but wait when the king leaves the scene his queen makes music with the minstrel b walthall when the king discovers the lovers he decides to enact a horrific edgar allen poe-type revenge difficult to believe the lovers can't hear those plotting against them although the actors are trying to look alternately noisy lovers and quiet cement mixers the sets make the sealed room look very staged the performances are okay and the story is easy to follow the sealed room griffith arthur v johnson henry b walthall marion leonard
one of the worst movies i've seen shoddy camera work crappy filter usage film was grainy script was terrible i mean come on how predictable was the big battle at the of the fight scenes were okay i scenes were so bad it was comical like sorbo getting the horse and riding at the i mean really a horse oh cant forget how the bad assassins roll around in the same vehicle throughout the entire would think that after killling key witness and federal agents they woulda been tracked etc really don't bother watching it
i won't add to the plot reviews not very improbable orphanage on and lee at their nice for face spotting and i quote look at the mouth that is cassie from fools and a poor example of the british film mackay was far better in fraggle rock keith barron was better in anything else and diana dors did what she did feature it was free to watch on the horror channel prior to its going over to subscription i won't be subscribing on this effort
with a bo derek movie the audience get just what they expect a paper thin plot and a few shots of mrs derek in no clothes ghosts can't do it is just that the first fifteen minutes is ordinary tv drama as long as scott quinn is still alive he is a very good actor with long experience in a lot of different roles but it seems as even a famous actor need to work just for money sometimes bo derek is the opposite always playing a strikingly handsome young woman with or without clothes the movie is a complete waste of time if you want to see quinn rent lawrence of arabia or la strada if you want to see nude women or bad acting rent any porno movie
i question the motive of the creators of this fictional account of the btk motives are they attempting to portray animal rights activists as sick monsters who is responsible for this don't they think the people involved with this monster are hurting enough what a blatant disrespect and exploitation of the victims it was like a personality experiment what disturbs you more the slaughterhouse or the human murders they used actual names of some of the movie was hideous disrespectful and insulting the creators of this movie used this tragedy for their own agenda people need to awaken and redraw the line
a very tired looking burt reynolds plays a mercenary battling his former employers for some gizmo these non-heroes plan to sell to the iranians low-rent video nonsense by the producers of silk stalkings offers some decent action footage and a lot of ineptly staged lack of logic and truly dreadful dialogue are the defining aspects although the final twists and allegiance shifts could've been a nifty end to a better movie burt still has presence although it also means you notice more when he mouths insultingly half-baked one-liners
unbelievably bad acting a no good unclear story and flashy images and slow-motions where they are needed the least adrenaline is everything a movie should not verbaan so-and-so dutch soap actress who hasn't attended her english classes plays rich girl freya who has the habit of thrill-seeking which basicly is doing dangerous stunts break stuff and annoy people and not in a fun jackass way then dracko he kinda leads the bunch but has other illegal activities on the side then dad who plays a dubious role as well and in the end we got jason fyall the boyfriend of day freya gets disappeared and everybody seems involved but we the viewer really don't care as nobody of the cast is either likable or believable and the story doesn't make any was this even made
i remember this film exhibit in barcelona in for the time of a week although it could seems incredible and i can't offer any explanation for it this movie was exhibit in a theater dedicated to movies of art and big quality is bergman resnais malle bu√±uel and the projected man few people saw it people no doubt and no reference about this very boring sf movie can be found in the peter nichols science fiction encyclopidie or about the author of the original novel very indicative i remember of it after all this years a no-story a lot of special effects that seems ridiculous effects in fact and no more it seems that in some countries the running time is mm and in anothers min well it means only a little more of pain
i really didn't like this movie because it didn't really bring across the messages and ideas l'engle brought out in her novel we had read the novel in our english class and i absolutely loved it i'm afraid i can't say the same for the film there were some serious differences between the novel and the adapted version and it just didn't do any credit to the imaginative genius that is madeleine l'engle this is the reason i gave it such a poor rating don't see this movie if you are a big fan of texts because you will be sorely disappointed however if you are watching the movie for entertainment purposes educational as was my case then it is an alright movie
i know that the real story of little richard is a lot more thrilling than this maudlin and thoroughly average biopic but then producer little richard was probably too reluctant to bring to light any sordid details of his life and just gave us a forgettable facsimile of his career highlights from the and
this film concerns purportedly non-establishment types and sexually who apparently cannot resist basic romantic needs although some excellent players take part including jon tenney timothy olyphant and cynthia nixon they are grounded by a puerile script which relies nearly totally upon clever dialogue which isn't role possesses the best lines but she often homes in on them too quickly a timing flaw which must be saddled upon the director the grotesque climax utilizes every available cliche spent or not and fittingly ends this drab attempt at comedy
this is definitely a stupid bad-taste movie eddie murphy stars in what is written like a sitcom he is surrounded with his perfect family full of good family values if you're looking for politically correct entertainment this movie is for you but if you hate the idea of being the only one not to laugh at obscene gags in a movie-theater full of pop-corn addicts just flee
spoiler the young lover jed is kicked out by the spinster kate mcdowell because she wrongly believes that jed is having an affair with one of her two catty girlfriends kate thought she caught them en flagrante delicto kate throws shoes out the door jed reluctantly leaves and then sits in the middle of the road to put his shoes on then he gets run over one of the meaning of the title by a truck and then he gets run over by a truck can you imagine a screenwriter actually submitting a script with this plot element up to then its a comedy that intends to be frothy but lacks any real fizz everybody but jed is just annoying and then they kill jed and sad until the end where the gals learn to love one another and be supportive instead of destructive i give it
what can you say about a grainy poorly filmed stag film where the best and most attractive performer is a german shepherd nothing that would be positive avoid this travesty at all costs in any case it would be difficult to find since bestiality remains a taboo and illegal subject in the usa i strongly suggest imdb to re-visit their weighting formula for establishing ratings since an rating for this piece of fecal matter is absurd i am by no means a prude and have spent many hours enjoying the classic porn movies of the but this is inferior product even by the looser standards of the illegal stag loop
i had high hopes for this film i thought the premise interesting i stuck through it even though i found the acting save helena bonham carter unremarkable i kept hoping my time spent would pay off but in the end i was left me wondering why they even bothered to make this thing maybe in george version there is a message worth conveying if this film accomplished anything it has inspired me to read classic i find it hard to believe his tale could be as disappointing as this adaption if the film message is the mundane life is worth living well then they've succeeded i would recommend this film to no one minutes of my life wasted
i don't know what they were mean anybody even remotely connected to this seen so bad seen so really bad then i will say one wrote the script has manged to put what could possibly the most inane dialogue over the is nothing good about this from a technical standpoint or any other allowed it to be made and then released should have been fired are a few fairly well known names in this i hesitate to use the word more like a collection of random scenes that have no relation to another and make less than fail to see why anyone with any dignity would appear in got it really i still got ripped if i had gotten this movie for would still have been ripped is an absoluter
a story of amazing disinterest kills the psychic over and over again the characters and plot are completely uninteresting is mad camera work which is usually a redeeming factor in his films and any grasp of suspense is nowhere to be found padded out to an insufferable the end you won't be clamoring with excitement but stricken with boredom like me maybe an uncontrollable urge to fall asleep jennifer performance deserves occupancy in a better movie fulci gorehounds just not much going on in the
this film is a huge steaming pile have no idea why anyone felt that the version needed to be redone nor why striesand would have been a first choice to that matter i have no idea why our people americans tend largely to regard striesand as some kind of treasure at least in my opinion she had peaked professionally with with funny girl and up doc yourself a favor and rent the judy classic or even the original fine film in its own right but please please please skip this stinkpot
i found horrorvision almost unwatchable while only minutes in length i still found myself hitting the fast forward button again and again the acting was of the i scream and say a lot i'm intense school and the story was at best a scenario that had yet to be fleshed i never go to full moon for great film making i have never seen them produce as bad a piece of junk as this
this film is roughly what it sounds like a futuristic version of the cinderella legend but with songs and tame sex scenes the film is not sure what it wants to be and pretty much ends up a mess more expensive looking than most of director al films but not at the same budget level that viewers have come to expect from sci-fi films the actors are pretty bad and unlike most adamson films there are no former big namers or b actors some of the music is ok but easy to see why cinderella has been forgotten for so many years
this movie was a disappointment i was looking forward to seeing a good movie i am the type of person who starts a movie and doesn't turn it off until the end but i was forcing myself not to turn it off reason why i didn't turn it off was because i am a huge christian slater fan and i wanted to see him act in it i was really speechless after i finished watching the movie movie was one of the worst movies that i have seen in my life thank you christian slater for putting some humor into it if you hadn't been in this movie i would of been bored out of my also agree that anthony hopkins needs to stick to acting by the time the movie was over i didn't even get the plot i was both confused and annoyed
this film was probably inspired by masculin f√©minin and i urge you to see that film film has two strong elements and those are the realistic acting the impressive undeservedly good photo apart from that what strikes me most is the endless stream of silliness lena nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world she acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this unattractive comparing to film intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity without going too far on this subject i would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the french and the swedish movie of its time and place
a gave it a instead of a because there is no denying that many of the visuals were stunning a lot of talent went into the special effects and artwork but that wasn't enough to save sepia toned washed out colors sort of thing has been done before many times in other movies nothing new there i can see there were some hat-tips to other old classic movies ok no problem with a movie has got to be entertaining and interesting not something that would put you to story line and the script of this movie was awful the characters two dimensional slow moving some of the scenes were pretty to look at but ultimately as a whole it was quite boring i couldn't recommend it
i borrowed this movie because not only because its gay theme but the thought of role playing really intrigued me i was pleasantly surprised that it was shot in san francisco since i live near sf and of course it was nice to see shots of the castro district the castro to me really caters more to gay male than female but other than that i can't really recommend this movie the characters aren't really developed for me to care and when they finally started to get to the role playing i was already bored out of my mind and the role playing scenes that i did see were a bit embarrassing to watch the acting leaves something to be desired needless to say i didn't finish the movie i'd skip this one
if you can imagine mickey mouse as a new york street pimp or john wayne as a communist spy then you might believe pat boone as a juvenile delinquent on his farm in kentucky and you could conceivably enjoy this film is so stupid that it isn't even campy for a mid sexless love story and the problem is that hollywood made such a big deal about pat refusal to kiss a woman not his wife on screen before its release that the audience knows he won't kiss shirley jones so you cannot build any anticipation for the screen consummation of their love sort of like watching a western in which the cowboys don't have story is pointless even the title song is sung with pained love belongs in the worst film bargain bin along with ishtar and plan from outer space
i'm hearing rumors of an upcoming leonard nimoy demonstrates the blu-ray disc with advances over the past years ranging from steady-cam to cgi it'll be interesting to see if the franchise can be reinvigorated i just hope it helps to remove the bad taste left in my mouth by that whole magnavision demonstration yes leonard nimoy demonstrates the betamax vcr was a brilliant milestone in entertainment history after the tentative leonard nimoy demonstrates the compact cassette and the downright tacky leonard nimoy demonstrates the tape who would have expected such a glorious piece of cinema i'm weeping right now just thinking about it
vampire in retreat is a acting is atmosphere is non-existent and the characters are only scary thing about this piece of scum is that majority of the imdb users gave it a is really evil completely supporting cast is also people may like this a mainstream society but hard-core horror fans or gore-hounds won't enjoy this piece of i hate horror prefer watching serious horror movies like cannibal holocaust or last house on the my real horror movie is supposed to be bloody and stupid usually ruins the whole one isn't even funny as a don't waste your precious time
roy rogers stars as jesse james and his look-alike gambler man clint burns george gabby hayes is mr ex-pal sheriff gabby gale storm fillmore and sally payne morgan are a noteworthy team as two reporters on the lookout for stories about the elusive outlaw course mistaken identity impersonation is a plot development since rogers essays a dual role rogers is charming as usual but there is nothing really elevating this his performance above the ordinary any potential to deliver a memorable performance is done in by poor material the better pair to watch are ms storm and ms paye as the st louis journal reporters they are the highlight the songs are fine though badly synched jesse james at bay joseph kane roy rogers george gabby hayes gale storm
i wanted to like magnolia the plot reminded me of grand canyon i liked different that come together at the end but magnolia took a wrong turn halfway through the movie and i was lost i almost turned it off right then and there but i felt i should hang in there until the end little did i know it would be another torturous hours thank god i rented instead of seeing it in the theatre i almost screamed out in frustration after hours the biggest kick in the pants was the ending frog scene my dvd player still hasn't forgiven me and i don't blame it one bit it was a unique movie but a bad boring and pointless movie
i have to say that this was the worst film of alongside much better kyonki which was also his directorial venture it contains no specific storyline and just focuses on body showing by debuting actresses and some silly comedy sequences i think priyadarshan is becoming too much repetitive in his comedy flicks just like govinda and david dhavan had done in the past after giving some good entertainers they also went on to loose their it will be good for him to concentrate more on script and try some variations in his us more of and malamal rather than giving duds like garam masala
distasteful cliched thriller has young couple doing cross-country research on most infamous murder sites becoming road partners with a dim-witted young woman and her snarling is an actual psycho arty and alienating the tone alternates between pouty pseudo-irony and silly flamboyance handsomely-made perhaps but ultimately laughable brad performance as the low-rent killer is godawful from
angels who got a little icky were banned from heaven and now reside in a british forest where they seduce and chop up teens talk about high concept on the plus side this little mother gives us tom savini but since his acting range is limited to two minutes screen-time his five minute presence seems a tad long the angels run around the forest naked for the most part of the movie but though they might have the body of an angel their faces sure look like joan rivers on a bad day mediocre acting and amateurish gore-effects don't help and the night scenes fatally recall paris most famous movie so bad that it is really bad
even in a bad film there is usually some redeeming feature something that you can say yes it was terrible but there was that performance or that part of the script or that special effect this was just simply terrible all over the acting was laughable the script terrible complete with many inexplicable breakfast at references and even the special effects were shoddy at best this was a very bad film and one that even drew barrymore wishes was expunged from history watch it if you want to a suffer harsh self inflicted pain b see just how bad a film can be this is one film where i can use the clich√© ninety minutes of my life i will never get back with some justification
this guy has no idea of cinema okay it seems he made a few interestig theater shows in his youth and about two acceptable movies that had success more of political reasons cause they tricked the communist censorship this all is very good but look carefully he does not know his job the scenes are unbalanced without proper start and and with a disordered content and full of emptiness he has nothing to say about the subject so he over-licitates with violence nakedness and gutter language how is it possible to keep alive such a rotten corpse who never understood anything of cinematographic profession and art why don't they let him succumb in piece
pandemonium is a horror movie spoof that comes off more stupid than funny believe me when i tell you i love comedies especially comedy spoofs airplane the naked gun trilogy blazing saddles high anxiety and spaceballs are some of my favorite comedies that spoof a particular genre pandemonium is not up there with those films most of the scenes in this movie had me sitting there in stunned silence because the movie wasn't all that funny there are a few laughs in the film but when you watch a comedy you expect to laugh a lot more than a few times and all this film has going for it geez scream had more laughs than this film and that was more of a horror film how bizarre is of four
from beginning to end this is the most emotionally overwrought movie about nothing i have ever seen the characterizations and interactions between the title character and marthe character are pure torture the racetrack as metaphor gimmick is so overplayed that it borders on cliche yet director pollack treats every hairpin turn as if it were something profoundly some value for a re-playing of some of the scenes such as pacino getting in touch with his inner female for goof value but even such accidental humor is hard to find in this total turkey
this was a watershed event in my movie watching life i went to see this in the theater when it came out i was completely amazed at just how bad it was movies like this make you wonder who put the money up and who owed whom a favor a very very large favor the special effects are absolutely first grade level as in any first grader could have done them toy rubber bats on strings with no attempt to hide the strings arrows that appear to be drawn on the film and look to be the shape of an arrow you'd find on a street sign and a laughable story line ed wood made masterpieces compared to conquest every film student should see this thing just so they'll know the very definition of a bad movie
sometimes you wonder how some people get funding to create a movie as bad as this one you can only stand about minutes of this utter piece of garbage before you stomp back into blockbuster and demand your money back i will now look at michael clarke duncan with lent his name to this vermin
a scientist finds out how to bring the dead back to life however they come back with faces of marble eventually this all leads to totally predictable outing this scared me silly when i was a kid but just bores me now i had to struggle to stay awake with one exception the acting is horrible such expressionless boring actors are some good things about this carradine despite the script actually gives a very good performance and there are a few mildly creepy moments involving a ghost of a great dane walking through walls also one of the worst-looking knockouts in cinema history still none of this is fun enough to sit through this avoid
the domino principle is without question one of the worst thrillers ever made hardly any sense can be made of the convoluted plot and by the halfway point you'll want to throw your arms up in frustration and scream i give gene hackman and director stanley kramer ever got involved in this mess must only be summed up by their hope they spent their money well
ok this for this mean rich old geezer leaves his estate to his adult children all of them ungrateful losers and two creepy servants provided they spend the week in his spooky old house what happens that night will surprise only those who haven't seen a movie or television show before after a string of murders in which the victims look like they're bleeding restaurant ketchup we have a painfully obvious twist ending the cast is lead by some once respectable actors must have been desperate for their paychecks there are also a few second-tier actors who were rising at the time but long forgotten now as a result the film generates all the drama and mystery of an episode of matlock i will give credit where the closing scene is clever and amusing if you're still awake
evidently when you offer a actor enough money they will do anything i am not sure how much john rys-daves got but most of the money he made should go to his fans as an apology for even being associated with such a rotten movie the special effects were worse then effects from the b movies and the acting of the rest of the cast was even worse as to how bad the acting was a child gave the second best performance in my opinion the english was terribly accented and i think no one could really even speak english they just memorized how the words should sound instead of memorizing the script and trying to make their character both life-like and real
i sort of accidentally ended up watching this movie i'm still not sure if i regret it or not i felt like i was watching the film made by that group of film school students that didn't quite make the cut it plays up every hollywood clich√© imaginable all the while flogging us with the corporations are the ultimate evil message subtlety this movie does not know as far as that goes it even manages to provide own story appears to be a computer fantasy world come true the lead character is an attractive teenage boy with a girlfriend yet is a programming genius and apparent hacker think among many other nerd-fantasy-come-true elements that you'll have to see for well i should've known it would be a z-movie when i saw ned bellamy he tends to be a good recommend this one i'm afraid
seriously this is one of the most stupid family shows of all a family without a mother and dads raise little girls in san francisco neat freak danny cartoon loving joey hair obsessed jesse spoiled brat michelle stupid dj and almost normal stephanie the creators of this show really want you to hate the characters don't they i do not think anyone should watch this show i only chuckled at a few moments in the whole running and i think that instead of lethal injection all criminals should be forced to watch this show a torture far worse than anything or d
this movie is just not worth your time its reliance upon new-age mysticism serves as its only semi-interesting distraction the plot is one that has been re-cycled countless was only prompted to even spend the time to put in a comment when i noted that some have tried to prop-up the reputation of this drivel their motivation objectivity is dubious since they encourage you not to look at the movies faults but at its well intentioned message of new age would it be alright for some twenty to thirty evangelical christians or islamic fundamentalists to pour in positive ratings about that support their views in spite of the poor qualities of production or the lack of truth in any of its supposed historic basis i hope am sure the followers will come right behind me to say flowery things about this movie in spite of the truth
the script for this tv soap opera is so bad that even a hopkins at some point had to play like an undergrad drama-student so as to bring some life in his script-dead character i do not know whether this was the purpose of the director but hopkins ciano reeked nothing but vanity fear and lack of self-esteem the real ciano possibly was all that but then why make a movie about him mussolini was a bit more convincing and his long way down was as if closer to the truth edda mussolini was plain ridiculous because of sarandon but because of the impotent script while she had to be the central character of this alleged familial drama watch it only if you enjoy venezuelan soap opera
the nsa cia fbi fsb and all other snoop agency in the world should watch this movie to gain information as to how to spy on people commentary states has the dirt on every tentacles reach far and wide there is no hiding from the klaus telescopes that can spy over millions of miles to ears that can hear everything its amazing that the cia doesn't have santa on the payroll dance routine is hilarious is so cheese factor in of this movie is tremendous very low budget but so fun to watch i recommend watching the mystery science theatre version for even more even get a laugh at the missfortune of the good give this a for production quality and a for pure cheese and fun factor
worst movie i have seen since gingerale afternoon i suppose that this is a i pretty much predicted every scene in this movie the special-effects were not so special i believe that i could come up with as good of effects from what i have lying around the house i wish i could have something good to say about this movie but i am afraid that i don't even coolio should be ashamed of appearing in such a turkey i do after a little thought have one thing good to say about this movie it ended
this is a movie of tired yet weirdly childish clich√©s a nazi witch master performing sf-related experiments in the basement oh please for a creeping sense of horror and fear the general impression of the film is that of a very immature conception of fright not having any expectations beforehand i am left with an aged xander from buffy and a heroine with ape-like face who doesn't seem to know how to act said adrienne barbeau have i only only encountered before in the much more enjoyable cannibal women in the avocado jungle of and editing adds to the general impression of lame
this unpleasant film has little to recommend it dolph lundgren gives a performance that is better than either this script or his other action films have allowed and there are occasional snippets of dialog that suggest the film might have been able to provide some insight into a bizarre no motivations are either murky or trite most of the acting is sub-par the script creates needless confusion and the needless fascination with focusing on gore is hard to imagine who the audience is for this film
when i was younger i thought the first film was really good in childhood so i decided to see the sequel this is an example of why some films shouldn't have sequels because the first film is usually best and it is basically now that ariel and eric are married they have a daughter who isn't allowed outside the house because they are worried about the sister of ursula octopus legged villain from film one morgana getting to her when the kid gets out she asks sister to turn her into a mermaid like her mum was this makes ariel go back to the sea to find her the same good voice artists just the story that could have had a bit more thought adequate
this movie is despite its independent status a stupid hollywood version of a nauseating mother-daughter relationship it wasnt that bad at first but somewhere during the course of the the time that the daughter goes out with that guy i turns into a cheesey mother-daughter bonding movie im sorry but i dont know of any mothers who have that kind of relationship with their probably better that way though
i thought that my favorite martian was very boring and drawn out it was not funny at all the audience just sat through the whole movie and didn't laugh at all not even the kids laughed that is sad for a disney movie i thought they could have found somebody better to play the martian rather than christopher lloyd he was really stupid and he was not funny i thought the talking suit was really dumb in the original television series the suit doesn't talk and move around in my opinion they should not have wasted their time on this movie i give it two thumbes down really a waste of time and i would not recommend the movie to anybody thank you
very funny to watch island as kind of natural is like answer to jess type of strikes back to face to very very very stupid unbelievably bad directed scenes look even better than hand-to-hand scenes beauties scenes incredibly scenes are very main luck of film is pretty landscapes and festival joke at start of film and list of franco kin at the end special attraction naked forgot franco can sing
many things become clear when watching this film the acting is terrible tom hanks and wendy crewson are so-so but the parent-child conflict borders soap opera-ish the other two boys an overly pouty child prodigy and your stereotypical i'm-a-babe-but-i'm-really-sensitive-inside blonde dreamboat the film as a whole is depressing and disappointing dreams and episodes are disturbing by tom hanks the inclusion of the beginning love ballads is an odd choice are all special friends the weird lines and side plots are not made any better by the terrible acting and this is a really bad movie expect to be probably disturbed
the reasons to watch this knock off err tribute to a great movie called on while your channel surfing and nothing else on someone pays you to watch yourself a favor and pop in the dvd for rent it download it on itunes or put it in your netflix cue and skip the flock entirely the flock the same story with with a few changes furthermore the editing just wreaks of and actually ends up taking you out of the story several times the worst one is probably the fly over desert helicopter shots with sounds of people people chattering over the radio except there are no police helicopters flying overhead in this line i call it a blatant knock off if you wanna be nice you can call it a tribute film go ahead but either way go watch
no scenario bad actors melissa gilbert beurk beurk beurk a such budget to make this in belgium we make ten films which win all prices in cannes with time that i've seen a such null-film was hypercube but scenario was anyone knows if the director was a graduate in school-film or a cop better things in this film was the word authorize to sell this is to expensive pay ten dollars to buy me pay for this was my big mistake of time i'll break my arm but buy this type of
i'm basing this on my observations of one episode i saw last night i don't think i'll be watching again the acting was totally wooden the plot completely predictable the ending totally unrealistic i mean who would believe a million dollar judgment for the death of a recovering drug addict with terminal cancer the lead actor garber seemed so uncomfortable almost embarrassed in his role perhaps he realized how bad the writing was i fully realize that the drama offered this season is pretty poor but they can surely find better writers maybe they are outsourcing the writing to india or china i'll bet we won't be seeing this one next season
this movie had a fairly good sounding plot but the paste was very slow very slow indeed even if someone thinks this is a cult classic i think that there are a lot better films from that era to be cinematography is not excellent but not the worst either the sounds are ok lighting still wouldn't recommend this to anyone else than maybe a movie does not contain music and the horses having sex don't make it a good one either and the woman masturbating on the edge of the bed was plain winnings here skip this utter boredom i've seen worse believe me but this is just waste of time and i don't get the good reviews here especially the high ratings
the interplay between the characters is a moral disaster you end up disliking most of the characters and you don't particularly like any of the two main characters played by david and gwen are so badly written that you really don't care one bit about them the movie has no plot no direction and no purpose the single redeeming quality of the movie was to treat it as a glimpse into the messed up lives of a few losers and hardly stimulating even as an afternoon waste
have to admit this version disgraces shakespeare upfront none can act except the nurse who was my fav juliet had good skills as a teen but she can't give emotional depth to her lines and we really can never connect to her worse doing the scene when she is contemplating drinking the sleeping stop whining i would have poured it in her mouth to shut her up anthony considering his other great movies revisited ivanhoe scarlet pimpernel quite a shocker in this one and don't get me started on still good to see if you're on the hunt to see every romeo and juliet ever made in the history of film olivia and version is still the best followed by leslie version and then the current leo and clare
mean spirited and down right degrading adaptation to the classic tale not only lacks the charm of its forefather but lacks any talent what so ever mike myers should not only be ashamed of himself for his horrible performance that is a clear rip off of what jim carrey did but he should give up acting all together he is so annoying that you would want to beat the crap out of him if you were able to jump right in the film the sets are ugly and the cinematography is very poor i have seen a lot of bad film this year but this not only takes the cake but it is with out a doubt one the worse films ever made
not even the most ardent stooge fan could possibly like the movie one of them the stooges just aren't given any material to work with it is really a shame too because this is the only feature length movie the stooges did with curly and this one effort by them is painfully unfunny when it could have had great potential awful musical numbers don't help any either the short they did with the same title has more laughs
i had never thought the standard of yashraj films would ever degrade to such an extent the film has a nonsense storyline which catches no has over acted kareena has improved her figure but is not a good actress anyway akshay is good anil is also good may i say the role wasn't deal of cheapness is filled in wondered if that was supposed to be the comedy part of the movie just because last few movies were flops does that mean yashraj films should make this kind of rubbish it has a history of so many good films i was totally disappointed with the movie
ok its not the best film i've ever seen but at the same time i've been able to sit and watch it twice story line was pretty awful and during the first part of the first short story i wondered what the hell i was watching but at the same time it was so awful i loved it cheap laughs all the jebidia deserves an oscar for his role in this movie the only thing that let him down was half way through he stopped his silly name the film was pretty perfetic but if your after cheap laughs and you see it in pound land go by it
remembering the dirty particulars of this insidiously vapid movie is akin to digging into your chest cavity with a rusty salted spoon perhaps home alone lost in new york was a bit on the predictable side but this pathetic excuse for a film is just one of the most shameless bids at commercialization i have ever heard of a boy fighting off when home alone in a chicago suburb with the chickenpox ridiculous why did this film have to be made i am the kind of person who believes even terrible movies are not wastes of time but rather learning experiences however this is actually a waste of time it should be avoided at all costs
i'm sure this was one of those woah attractions in when epcot opened but now just silly the message is clich√© the circle-vision is disorienting and that awful song at the end is grating and i really wish they'd install seats after so much walking all you want to do is sit down for a few minutes and when you hear a film to see it sounds pretty glamorous you get entertained while sitting down right wrong you're standing there for minutes leaning against a short little railing disney should make a newer maelstrom like attraction to liven things up and replace this dull lackluster film not fun skip it in fact skip canada altogether unless you're eating there move directly to the united kingdom
i totally disagreed with those comments which said this is a good movie this is a totally sucked movie i mean sucked the story development is strange mia kirshner changed from an innocent girl to a party-fun seeking chick for no convincing reasons at all in addition all the actresses looked way too old for being college students college students looked like about years old you figure out the rest i watched only about first ten minutes and started fast forwarding to look for sex scenes all the sex scenes are lame hasty and most importantly no frontal at all all the sex scenes are laughable considering how many clothes they had on do yourself a favor put it down and save yourself a few bucks conclusion story sex acting score out
based on one of the books by gabriel marquez and it might be brilliant literature this cinema-adaption really sucks as more like fighting against sleep rather than enjoying some cinematographic delices the story is about an old couple whose son died and living a life that is heavily dominated by poverty and wherein the main character is a cock that hopefully one day brings some money for a forthcoming cockfight i am in no mood to spill more words on this useless pretentious piece just perhaps that you can see salma hayek in here but sitting minutes in front of your screen for just that no gracias
this is one of those cheaply made tv movies were the characters seem to lose all sense the premise of the story the kidnapping of a son by the very good but the story just seems to beggar belief whenever the mother is advised not to do anything you know fine well she is going to do it it is a bit far fetched and not worthy of a viewing
this was a truly insipid film the performances are third rate and the dialogue is so stilted that at times it seemed to have just rolled over and died my reason for renting this was simple find a movie with scriptwriting i needed a visual aid for my presentation so i figured why not use a clip boy was i wrong after searching my local video store i came upon this where it was suspiciously titled starstruck i thought what the hey and decided to give it a try well i was very unhappy with my results there was maybe one scene i could use and meanwhile i was practically falling asleep because of the sheer banality of the flick took this back and picked up ed wood a movie i can use as an example then again anything would be presentable compared to the drivel that is starfucker
i had to endure teen-aged high school angst and family conflict for almost all of the show i really do not care about high-school girls fretting about their relationships i've spent my time in hell dealing with such issues and i care nothing about fictional teenies going through lite versions of the horrors i endured i want science fiction the only reason i'm here there were a few seconds of science fiction late in the show we finally see a proto-cylon it was good but with one problem its red eye-dot would lock onto an object of interest we all know that cylon eyedots always scan back and forth giving the machine a map of the world the red eye-dot does not ever stop moving back and really hope the writers fix this abuse before the second episode
do we really need any more narcissistic garbage on the baby boomer generation technically i am a boomer though at the time when all the idealistic youths of the were reading marx burning their draft cards and generally prolonging a war which destroyed tens of thousands of lives i was still in grade school but i remember them well and out of were just moronic fools who would believe anything as long as it was is just another excercise in self-importance from the kids who never really grew up
if you are planning to rent or buy this movie don't the worst thing i have ever seen i would comment on it more but it has been years since i saw it and have blanked all of it from my mind save yourself some time money and well being and stay far far away
this movie was so bad i couldn't sit through it without doing something else there was no plot and no point i was thoroughly bored and for a film about a stand up comedian i couldn't recall one joke or funny line worthy of the description politicians with no charisma speaking technical jargon could not be less how was this made is there no quality control in film watching the girls in bikinis was the only distraction during this horrible hard to imagine that adam sandler who has become popular and has appeared in fine comedies was able to survive after this kind of exposure he was not funny in the least in this movie so it proves that the writing is so vital in effective comedy
hello can anybody hear me i don't know why you came to this page but if you're a fellow viewer of this movie join the fanclub this movie was so unbelievably bad i couldn't stop laughing when i saw it i think a must see bad in a nice way every cliche ever invented for a horror movie can be seen here i'm afraid very hard to get a copy of this movie but it should be in the top of worst movies ever made
this italian film from the is not even in the class with dog soldiers the howling or even that awful american werewolf in paris is fun to watch i'm talking about watching the lead actress a stunning blonde run amok in her birthday suit we're talking about graphic complete obvious that she is a real humma humma the story is a hoot the sfx are childish and the acting the most part stinks the only redeeming value of this movie is all there is a lot the nudity sex scenes tame by hbo standards but still fun to see when you find yourself without a date on saturday night the is no werewolf in the opening scene of the ancestor the girl just imagines that a other words a clinical lycanthrope
a good deal of running around a badly conceived adversary with very little complexity a scientist who works in communications sending off signals into space and receiving them gets caught up with aliens along with his pretty wife he invades their territory and is given secrets about them he becomes rather traitorous in the process granted he is given little choice anyway there is a scene where he gives them everything they want this is a dull movie with lots of long stretches where little happens the plot isn't technically bad just that we are usually following a car a trip through a woods investigating a building this is what editing is all about i suppose the story wouldn't technically support much more not much here
how has this piece of crap stayed on tv this long terrible it makes me want to shoot someone so fake that it is actually worse than a sci-fi movie i'd rather have a stroke than watch this nonsense i remember watching it when it first came out i thought hey this could be interesting then i found out how absolutely insanely ridiculously stupid it really was it was so bad that i actually took out my pocket knife and stuck my hand to the people stop watching this and all other reality shows they're the trash that is jamming the networks and canceling quality programming that requires some thought to create
i have never commented on imdb before but i feel i have to after watching the batman animation its absolute rubbish warner brothers had the perfect animation series in batman in the early so what the hell are they doing trying to mess with the winning formula i feel like writing a complaint letter to wb the original animation was dark and brooding exactly the way batman was intended to be wb had to mess this up with some tripe batman of the future now they produce this drivel the joker doesn't remotely resemble the joker from dc comics dc should sue i urge everyone who agrees with me to email or write to wb and use people power to get back the original formula
this movie had so much potential a strong cast a reasonably strong idea and clearly a decent budget i'm not sure where it all went wrong but each of those elements was wasted the story went nowhere the characters were hollow to say the least and the result was a very boring pointless waste of a film i hated it judging by the other votes i'm in the minority here and must be some sort of freak however i thought this movie was dreadful i had high hopes but was very disappointed a particular disappointment was jody character a very cocky fixer of sorts makes a nice idea jody was confident and sexy but the character did nothing and went nowhere denzel washington played the same character he always plays enjoyable but nothing new
this is even worse than the original game of death a jumbled incoherent storyline leads to billy lo falling from a helicopter to the ground below killing him as we're left to follow his younger brother bobby lo so not only do we start out following some bruce lee clone the film kills that one off and has us follow another one thirty minutes into the story the main reason to watch this one is when bobby lo fights a lion which is quite obviously a guy in a lion costume jang lee hwang is also the villain who is usually pretty awesome but his screen time is significantly small mainly watched this and the original game of death because they're a part of the bruce lee boxed set no wonder they're included with finished works no one would buy them otherwise
connie hoffman is very pretty and is attractively topless at it folks the sole reason for even considering whether to watch this film or sexploitation period pieces are sometimes entertaining by virtue of their very datedness trousers big hair zapata moustaches etc this one script is bad the acting is bad the direction is bad and the idea of having a senior citizen romantic leading man is exceptionally title hinting at a sex comedy is grossly heartily recommend avoiding this one like the plague
for movie fans who have never heard of the book the haunting of hill house and have never seen the robert wise production with julie harris this remake will seem pretty darn those of us who have it is just plain acting was neeson thinking goofy computer enhancements and a further move away from story doom this yourself a favor and rent the original movie it still effectively scares without hokey special effects the acting is professional and readers of the book the from follows the it much closer
raising victor vargas is just a bad film no amount of denial or ad-dollar supported publicity with change this sad peter sollett saw he didn't have the money to do the movie he wanted to make and decided to take the easy way out by making a bad film that cynically apes the tenets of current edgy film-making maybe he just doesn't know any better hard to not hard to tell is the result except for a few viewers who will intellectualize the bad film-making into an attempt at pseudo-realism few will enjoy know i yourselves a favor and pass on this film
this would have to be one of the worst if not the worst movie i've ever nearly seen couldn't watch it all the way through purely and simply gratuitous violence just for the sake of it and the ridiculous story line only adds to the lacklustre and incompetent filming sick and only suitable for those with a love for manic mutilation after murdering several hundred men women and children seed is finally caught after effortlessly killing several more police officers that finally get a tip as to his whereabouts sentenced to death by electric chair and miraculously survives buried alive he digs his way out and plots revenge against those that put him away and flicked the switch needless to say more gruesome murders ensue
how a director of experience could ever expect us to want to spend time with or to care about what happens to a lead character who is neurotic a whiner a jerk with no redeeming qualities that is the central puzzle about this profoundly confused piece of work a monstrous piece of trash in addition to this crippling flaw the plot line requires serious concentration to follow the setup that the branagh character walks into is so obviously a setup from the start that we are inclined to wonder whether the writer and director have totally lost respect for their audience this latter issue is at the core of the film it represents directorial self-indulgence with profound contempt for the taste values and intelligence of the viewer very unusual for mr watson
written and acted by sincere amateurs produced by some exploitation monger this is dull and hard to the worst movie ever but at least schlock like from outer usually had a real actor or two i'd recommend thief in the only to hardcore ironists and hardcore dispensationalists i'm believe me watch it for free sourced from poor vhs here links added mostly to reach minimum
humphrey bogart clearly did not want to be in this film and be forced to play a part-mexican or he would have been suspended believe me he made the wrong choice presumably after the success of dodge city warners tried a follow-up with errol flynn and his usual list of buddies like alan hale guinn boy williams frank mc hugh and the ever-present john litel but they made the huge mistake of trying to present miriam hopkins as a love interest for flynn v randolph scott and as a singer to really make things bad because she proved one thing and that is she cannot sing the story was not too bad but with bogie clearly miscast also it turned out to be a poor western that was overlong and on a low budget but in fairness color would not have helped
this movie stinks i don't think i have ever seen a movie so strung up on shock value the plot was relatively interesting but the dialog was super flat and the acting was bland this could have been an a good movie i think it just relied on grotesque visuals i can usually handle graphic scenes and human taboos but it felt like miike shot it for the sake of shooting it just one poorly executed film there just isn't anything to be entertained by watching this film unless you are fascinated by exhausting yourself with explicit scenes of incest pedophilia necrophilia rape self milking parental and sibling abuse and fecal dispersement i think i just sold the film to many of you but i meant it when i said this stinks he has succeeded in other films but i think you'd be better off watching someone pooping
really i can't believe that i spent on this movie i am a huge zombie fanatic and thought the movie couldn't be that bad it had zombies in it right was i wrong to be honest the movie had thought it was cool when the guy got his head ripped off but that was about it overall i think that it would be more enjoyable to slide down a razorblade slide on my bare nutsack into a vat of vinegar then watch this movie again the movie could have been better if we could see some boob but i had to watch the trailers for the other movies produced by this company to see that buyer you are into masochism
if this movie were any worse it would have been directed by uwe boll this nonsensical mess makes ed wood look like hitchcock it has been a while since i have seen this steaming pile but i do remember that i wanted to do grievous bodily harm to all those involved how anyone can give this movie any more than star amazes me to the graciousness of all those that viewed this tripe i give it one star because there is not a rating lower all copies of this movie should be burned the ground sowed with salt and reserved as a landfill for the most toxic of waste no one copy should be kept under ultra hi security and shown only to film makers as an example of how not to do it
i hate this movie it is a horrid movie sean character is completely unsympathetic her performance is wooden at best the storyline is completely predictable and completely uninteresting i would never recommend this film to anyone it is one of the worst movies i have ever had the misfortune to see
this movie has no plot and no focus yes supposed to be a slap-stick stupid comedy but the screen-writers have no idea what the movie was about even the title doesn't go along with the movie it should have been called cool ethan or cheaters never win or something like that the characters are not developed and no one cares what happens to them the girl roommate character that show was the only person worth watching she was hilarious and stole every scene she was in the others need to make sure that their own college diplomas are in the works since they'll need a career other than acting
before starting to watch the show i've heard it was great and aesthetically very interesting what a deception the scripts are so dumb that i am quite sure the authors are son and grandson of scoobidoo writers and what about the sfx and colors they are so extreme that it is painful to watch colors are not saturated they are over saturated like scripts are overwritten and show is overrated this show is like a bad pie in which a child would have put only sugar and butter thinking that because these ingredients are the best they are sufficient unfortunately for this show the only two ingredients of this show are finally vacuity and a total lack of credibility
i like the cast pretty much however the story sort of unfolds rather slowly danny glover does a good job making you wonder if the bad guy meanwhile the other characters are just part of the story dennis quaid didn't have as much room in the story as he could have had i thought the first scene was a bit over the top grim compared to how the story unfolded i'd watch it again though i rated it a i could rate it a
a fabulous book about a fox and his family who does what foxs do that being stealing from farms and killing prey until a trio of farmers decide they've had enough of this fox and try in various ways to have the problem solved they are of course out foxed at every turn and while the trio are camped out at the fox hole the family perform raids against the three farmers version and i use the term film very loosely is more of a god awful pastiche of american heist movies particularly the oceans movies they they even have george clooney as mr fox to to add to the insult and manage to miss the point of the story quite completely so kudos to them they'll make lots of money and destroy another classic roald dahl children book
possible spoiler or two soul survivors is quite possibly the worst theatrical released movie ever nothing makes sense at all some plot about a girl who has strange visions of people who may or may not be dead the entire movie is just a bunch of random shots of things that don't really tie together by the end of the film tha acting is non-existent the camera work is jerky and the script is so confusing it just makes the movie even harder to i kept waiting for something to tie the movie together but nothing came definitely the worst film of the year stars
ok a slasher movie a very very stupid slasher got your stereotypical teenagers in a house thing going we got a fbi agent seen dirty harry one time too many so the we got about different little camera shots and scene that make no sense at all hey man i'm fixing the sprinklers guy was my favorite part of the movie suddenly a preacher tied up on a couch watching home movies he gets follow the killer into the middle of nowhere with no cops suddenly in a church wearing a wedding dress i swear this is the stupidest slasher movie i've ever seen
in this paranoia-driven potboiler our reporter hero battles hindersome authorities duplicitous co-workers renegade ufo debunkers and silent skulking aliens capable of mind control and zapping objects from afar it takes three of them to operate a control panel of about two dozen buttons the script clomps from event to puzzlers aplenty why did the aliens blind the dog why do they fry the soldiers with radiation when they're only patrolling an empty landing site and what space dudes worth their moon cheese abduct the ugly photographer first instead of his model inquiring minds want to know writer-director mario gariazzo apparently researched his subject by skimming a stack of ufo-themed tabloids as he took in a sunn classics double feature closing screen crawl boasts that based on actual like plan some may feel burned by the abrupt finale but it should still appeal to conspiracy cranks
a into watching this i never laughed so hard at a horror movie ridiculous plot with characters that were just insanely developed either not written in depth or too much you want to watch an absolutely written horror movie with stupid dialog messed up plot useless scenes wasted characters bad sound and lousy development overall then this is the one to sure to keep focused for the classic food processor scene and the totally inept police investigation is a remarkable new low in screen performance and writing and to sit through it for the entire duration makes you either stupid daring or brave
a surprising misfire from the usually reliable larry cohen told me too q etc full moon high tries so hard to be funny and fails miserably even with decent turns by ed and kenneth mars alan arkin looks embarrassed throughout his performance and son adam simply looks numb this makes teen wolf look like a comedy classic
christopher lee is one of my favorite actors i'm trying to view all of his work he has been known to single-handedly save movies with his presence unfortunately this is not one of them this movie suffers from a low budget and production values are disturbing the love of this film
now isn't it considering all the good work done by and jodie the movie never grew into something more than a horrible movies copycat yes a couple of jokes no absolutely no unpredictable twists to be honest the only unpredictable moments are there because both director and editor made some stupid mistakes it is a shame for them and a waste of time for us if someone can tell me why on earth were they digging a hole inside that safe who the hell is the rebe and how on earth did they know that the diamonds were in the particular cell it could just make my day but it seems that spike asks us to take too much things in this one for granted and do not raise our eyebrows when something looks just another studio contract movie relax and enjoy
i'm sorry but this is just awful i have told people about this film and some of the bad acting that is in it and they almost don't believe me there is nothing wrong with the idea modern day japanese troops get pulled back in time to the days of busido warriors and with their modern weapons are a match for almost everything when the troops first realise something strange is happening does every single person in the back of the transport need to say hey my watch has stopped imagine lines like that being repeated times before they say anything else and you have the lack of greatness in a nutshell
visually interesting but falls flat in the originality department this tedious excercise in technique wears thin after the opening battle jude law has the charisma of burnt toast but in his defense this film contains some of the worst dialogue i have ever seen on the big screen in fact the script is so poor that it keeps taking you out of the film and had me thinking about work bills my dogs etc there are many moments that scream bluescreen paltrow is as wooden as they get this could of been saved by snappy film noir dialogue or over the top camp my only complaint on the technique is that black white film computer would of helped because it looks like turner colorized black and white just a big dull clich√© mess i would rather break my femur than sit through this endurance test again
i really have problems rating this movie it is directed brilliantly there is obviously a lot of money in it gere and danes are intense her screen personality could use a bit more defining and spicing up editing and cinematography are excellent on the other hand it is one of those really really sick movies where one cannot help but wonder whether the director himself likes to stage specific scenes and yes one cannot help but wonder how many copycats will such a movie purely artistic terms it is a but i really have to ask myself who these people are giving their money to produce such a movie
poorly structured badly written loaded with cliches and flat dialogue not a single scene shines the actors struggle with a painfully dull scenario that manages to completely avoid any surprises plot twists or conflict you know from the first ten minutes where a movie set in ny it has almost no feeling for the city there are a dozen other indie movies that manage to make it seem magical on a small budget this one seems like it was shot in you cast natasha henstridge why dress her in baggy sweaters why make vartan look boring and drab the attraction i felt like i was watching a sub-par christian movie of the week it was so asexual and big success is that he convinced people to make this bland movie
i tried restarting the movie twice i put it in three machines to see what was wrong did steven voice change did he die during filming and the studio have to dub the sound with someone who doesn't even resemble him or was the sound on the dvd destroyed after about minutes you finally hear the real voice though throughout most of the film it sounds like the audio was recorded in a would be ashamed to donate a copy of this movie to goodwill if i owned a copy i rented it but i will never do that again i will check this database before renting any more of his movies all of which were or less good movies you usually knew what you were getting when you watched a steven seagal movie i guess that is no more
hard to believe people actually like this dreck i do think kids can enjoy it but to me the kind of kid film parents can't bear to sit through predictable plot boring belushi and possibly the worst kid actor of all time i will give the director some of the responsibility for the kid but she was truly painful to watch i feel embarrassed for her now having people know it was her when she sang the star spangled banner i had to turn the sound i came here and discovered they did that because she won star search i've always felt jim belushi should be ashamed to trade on the name of his wonderful sadly missed brother and this crap shows why zero stars
the acting itself wasn't even that bad since it did't come to mind in the movie but whatever had this director in mind the intended climb towards some climax completely missed the all scenes involve acting that stand so far from our own intentions and way of reacting on things that you don't really attach to any actor in the this case see through cheap method of boasting your way into potential metaphorical just wasn't here at guess i'm bitching but hours of my time
the plot doesn't offer any new excitements it even starts the same as cube i this time there are no other enhancements for the cube machinery except for having an extra exit which is not guarded very ingenious the characters are also not so well elaborated as in the first episode they just became flat as in a soap opera somebody makes it to the normal exit the person would be asked some questions like do you believe in god its not really creative or original and especially in my opinion it doesn't fit into the mystery of the cube with it traps really there is nothing much else to say about it
i'm a jean harlow fan because she had star quality i don't think her movies are good and i don't even think that she was a good actress but she certainly was great in comedies every bit of comedy in the girl from missouri is very good but this movie is perhaps more like a love story jean harlow is wonderful in this one and you can forget the rest of the cast their performances bring nothing new it always impresses me much to think that beautiful body was that of an ill woman well in this movie she does look beautiful
i really wanted to like this movie but it was just imposable the acting was ultra hammy the plot was annoying and the pace was slow sooo slowwwwww the whole time sitting in the theater i wanted the movie to end twenty minuets into a films and i'm praying for an ending sure some of the visuals were nice but c'mon guys i mean really and for a movie about a guy tuning magical instruments there really wasn't much music to speak of the music there was was annoying and boring there were sound loud shrill sounds at times too those were also annoying mainly this film managed to bore me and creep me out at the same glad its over i need to go see tideland and wash this bad taste out of my mouth
another american pie movie has been shoved down our throats and this one is the worst one of them all it doesn't deserve the name american pie they should have stopped at the movie feels like just a stupid porn movie which they slapped the title american pie on when i was watching this i felt like i was watching a different series it doesn't fell like american pie at all it has different humor and it is much more rude and has many more sex scenes then the other american pie don't recommend it ever actually i don't recommend any of the american pie presents movies just stick with the nice original
this is one strange hacked together film you get the feeling that the bond company had to come in on this one i'm not surprised no credits on it who would want to be associated with this film the acting of all involved is terribly stilted and the plot jumps around all over it all makes very little sense as i said before it looks like the bond company had to come in because it seems like there was alot of footage that wasn't shot that needed to be and all the music was very ill-fitting library music i guess very very odd i might actually buy a dvd of it though if it could let me in on what the hell was going on and what happened to this movie
i joined this site to see what comments people would make about this absolute disaster of a film i wasn't drawn in for even a second the characters were all one-dimensional they threw every topic they could think of hoping something would stick i would bet hope that everyone involved in teachers looks back with embarrassment there are some great actors here but you would never know it thank god it didn't destroy morgan or judd or nick or laura careers there was no vision no labor of love here only a horrible effort gone wrong btw i don't think the writer ever set foot in a real school
i guess this goes to prove that joe don baker will do anything for a buck the concept of the film wasn't very good to start with this movie has so many bad things about it i don't know where to start the acting is horrible the cinematography is marginal at best the soundtrack was pretty bad the score is terrible a reason why this movie ended up on mystery science theater i voted before i wrote this and i cannot believe that people actually thought this film is excellent they must have liked the two go-go dancers final justice would be if they locked this stinker in the film vault outside wichita and never let anyone see it again a out of rating is far better than this deserves
any movie that has nude scenes of karen allen and i'm still so bored i walk out that is a stinker gets stuck in paris and befriends a sissily-handsome french man with whom she is having sex soon of course married cheri why should that be a problem what could be an interesting clash of cultures is it or not just dull i walked out the movie got a lot better after i left but it would have had to have gotten a lot better to make up for a rotten advice if you find yourself in this run do not walk for the exit save your time and your energy most assuredly save your money a shame the production company didn't save its money
ah yes the vs series being the pinnacle been said before this is what you get when half of the crew fell asleep on the job unfortunately the gameplay half did don't get me wrong this is fun but you get tired of mashing buttons as for the plot summary ahahahahahaaaaa there is no plot beat that guy at the end and win eh who plays this by their self anyway
being a fan of cheesy horror movies i saw this in my video shop and thought i would give it a try now that i've seen it i wish it upon no living soul on the planet i get my movie rentals for free and i feel that i didn't get my moneys worth i've seen some bad cheesy horror movies in my time hell i'm a fan of them but this was just an insult
bad plot good for a b-movie good fast-paced fight scenes at most a out of but something has always bothered me about this film how come mariska hargitay never speaks in the tv version she shares several intimate moments with jeff speakman even a kiss in a garden yet in the regular version most of her scenes are cut and she never speaks at all this bothers me because it not only takes out a female cliched point-of-view to the film it also makes the final shot seem creepy this film would have been better had they kept her scenes in because in those scenes at least she has a personality one that undercuts whatever speakman says
i hated this movie so much i remember it vividly it is not even funny any movie that relies on unfunny sex jokes and racism humor does not deserve the money it costs to make it in the first half hour rob schneider drinks a carton of rancid milk all i could think was he deserves it for making such a bad movie don't waste your time or money on this one
i love these actors but they were wasted in this can only wonder what were they thinking agreeing to this winger just phoned it in dennis quaid and arliss howard were caricatures some people thought it was deep well if you liked breaking the waves you'll probably like this too i hated both
al pacino kim basinger tea leoni ryan o'neal richard schiff my mouth was watering i dropped everything to watch this movie on cable minutes in i was having trouble staying awake minutes in and i hit the record button and fell asleep finished watching it the next morning shouldn't have bothered what a waste of a great cast and an idea that could have been an interesting story of a day in the life cure your insomnia if you have it and watch this movie i guarantee you at least an hour and a half of uninterrupted sleep dialogue horrible continuity non-existent camera work could have been done with a hand held super and looked better movie was a total disaster
why bother seeing this movie if you have great movies to see it is a total waste of time and money the movie is so bad that i felt bad for wanting to watching it everything in it is bad actors were bad script was really bad the story is stupid and the worst cgi ever the only good moments were the first seconds of the movie in the strip club one interesting thing that there is a characther that we wish that he dies because he is so stupid that we get enough of don't remember the name but was the boyfriend of the chosen you want to see a good movie this movie isn't the right choice out of
i was supposed to review this for a website and i watched this with optimism that perhaps it would at least be a cheesy yet entertaining rip off and it didn't even do that well the child is probably one of the worst supernatural thrillers i've ever seen worse than godsend with scenes that rip from the omen without shame the ending is even very similar to the way the omen ends to mention that the acting writing and story are all just hackneyed if these movies make money i'm sad to see where asylum is headed embarrassing
i did not expect much from this film but boy-o-boy i did not expect the movie to be this bad chris rock is not showing a good act here you can't get the feeling that his caracter is real i think the movie would have been a bit better if drama or romantic scenes would have been a less part of the movie and humor was involved the movie is like the film makers were having a bad hangover making it in the making of they don't show a single smile this is a very bad film i gave it three out of ten because of few smiles it gave me but i did never laugh
this movie was terrible throughout the whole movie i was puzzled and did not see any point to it i had to go to this site and read the review to finally understand what it was about this movie is not worth watching at all not only is it sick and revolting but totally stupid please don't watch unless you are one of those that likes to watch bad movies if this movie questions japanese society and their values and roles than this is a country that i would not like to visit or bother to know this is a totally sick movie i did not enjoy it because it made no sense my boyfriend and i sat there waiting to see if it was a horror because that is what it was listed under it was total disappointment
if you want to see a retarded homosexual karate expert beat up a bunch of try hard wannabe mexican gangsters repeatedly for an hr then this is the film for you if not then choose another dvd from the bin which is the only place this film belongs the acting was so horrible that i had to force myself to watch it to the end the cover makes it look so cool but its just another cheap b grade gangster film along the lines of and a key bloody streetz and menace i would not buy or rent this film unless you are planing to get stoned and plot editing and acting really don't matter to you it is truly the worst film in the history of humanity
burt reynolds came to a point in his career where he appeared to just be going thru the motions he'd show up party with his friends on film and take home a big paycheck it didn't seem to matter to him that the product he was representing was pure film epitomized this more than stroker ace which makes cannonball run look like a classic and cannonball run ii look watchable save for a few race scenes there is absolutely nothing worth seeing here even the beautiful loni anderson hams it up so bad as a dumb blonde the thought of burt hamming it up with jim nabors and dressing like a chicken sounds funny then this is your movie otherwise pick almost any other film comedy and it won't be any worse
a remake of alejandro abre los ojos but this time with a living breathing mask as a lead for the dubious advantage of an english sound track we endure tom soulless performance as usual with zero depth yes the character is identified with his persona but we usually are given some character underneath that to hold our interest his empty posturing negates any erotic energy that could have been between his character and cruz or is an acting exercise that involves using masks to free the actor to enrich his presentation of character by verbal and body language means masking only painfully emphasizes his inadequacy as an actor do see the original amenabar open your eyes
well what can it be said about this disaster i watched it because it aired on cable i regret for wasting my time but at least i didn't waste money creature is the cheesiest you can get please you need to be very generous not to get angered by the cheap halloween costume oh well there are also displays of horrible acting and dialogues the confrontation with the creature is unbelievable you can't get a more pathetic scene is the worst you can get from direct to video flicks creature unknown makes full moon pictures movies look like halloween this one at all costs please the only positive thing about this trash are the sexy women
this is one of the weakest soft porn film around i can't believe somebody wrote this stupid story before making some changes the guy mike is a major wimp and moron i can't believe he didn't want to take a shower with his bride-to-be toni and be in a threesome with the french photographer jan he does do a threesome with toni and kristi but that was short i hate that every time in soft core porn films threesomes between a woman a man and a woman is short but a girl-girl thing is about an hour to the makers of these films have the threesomes alot longer this film should've have two threesome scenes not one but two
interesting to read comments by viewers regarding omega code many of the overwhelmingly positive comments were lifted almost word for word from tbn broadcasts the movie looks as if it were made to go directly to video to be stocked besides the three-part rapture series that was done by some other religious group in the dont remember it you wont remember this one either in a year or two this is the first movie i have ever seen where it was implied that it was your religious duty to go to it and buy as many tickets as possible to save souls very shameful this just goes to show that if you are a son you too can play high-roller hollywood producer with lil ole ladies tithe money
i went in not knowing anything about this movie and i walked out in an half hour knowing everything about it it was one of worst movies i've ever seen i'm a generally a nice person but if somebody told me they liked this movie i would probably never talk to them again anybody who likes it throughly is most likely to have an extremely dry hermit type personality i'm gonna also include that they think they are pretty intelligent too just like the self-centered fart bags who do the voices for the movie i know everyone has different types of humor some people may not even like mine but okay i don't think this covers any range of humor though this movie is as flat and dull as wes mind go in and get ready to walk out best to get your money back too
sure i've seen bad movies in my life but this one was so bad that i actually became angry in the theater i wanted my money back i wrote to the director asking him to refund my movie ticket of course i didn't receive a refund even a reply but the point that matters on a scale of i give this movie a why did the jeep blazer stop running from being hit with a bat why did they hit the blazer with the bat in the first place instead of cracking the skull the plot was thin the movie filled with obvious clich√©s and certain parts of it just didn't make any sense
this is one of the worst horror movies i have ever seen unfortunately i am a horror movie buff and will rent any horror movie unless not made for when looking at the box it says it is rated r for gore and some language where was the gore was their one good death scene where you actually saw gore i could have overlooked that if there had been some brief nudity or some good dialogue there wasn't even one remotely witty or amusing line in this lame movie sometimes horror movies are awesome because they are so stupid but this was just sad
i thought that this movie was pretty lame if you're looking for cheesey you may like this i myself don't mind a fair amount of cheese but this was ridiculous the progression of the movie bored me and the storyline was very only thing entertaining about this movie was the day-glo zombies but even that isn't reason enough to see this flick
while not as bad as his game-to-movie adaptations this hunk of crud doesn't fare much seems to have a pathological inability to accept that he doesn't make good movies one of these days he'll run out of money and stop inflicting the world with his acting was sub-par the dialog sounded like they were reading teleprompters and special little touches were seen throughout the whole all uwe boll movies this one just shouldn't and like uwe boll himself shouldn't exist
i'm not sure it was the language or the poor acting but everything about this movie feels and looks cheap and seeing der untergang this is a huge disappointment no connection between different scenes and the acting is so incredibly poor i couldn't even believe people could make such a mess of something that had great above all everyone in germany speaks english big mistake the german language has a certain sound to it and especially hitler himself only sounds like hitler when way the story is told made me believe it was improvised on the spot the characters were empty and the movie seems to be a collection of random events that could have the english or the fact that i've already seen der untergang everything about this movie was fake and ridiculous
based on ray dark bestseller this john in the woods hough-directed bust has little going for it does not lack gory violence it lack narrative sensibility and incubus of the title is a demon endowed with a mammoth penis that shoots red sperm into vaginas during intercourse or to be more precise cassavetes moonlighting from his successful directing career is convincing as a doctor who questions the circumstances of the bizarre attacks on young possibilities of the victims spawning demonic offspring are not considered and neither is the tolerance for slow moving reluctance to explore the dramatic repercussions of a fertile premise exemplifies the major problems with this vapid big-schlong-on-the-loose exercise
barbara streisand directs and stars in this very jewish have a chance at obtaining an education babs enthusiastically disguises herself as a boy which isn't the most difficult thing to do since she already looks like a boy anyway at her new school she meets many male classmates who have no trouble at all in believing a miss the best of many moments of unintentional humor when babs male friend thinks a man but pins him to the ground sits on top of him and looks affectionately into his eyes film splashy story about nothing particularly interesting
i admit i had to fast forward through this poorly transferred dvd after about minutes nothing was happening and everyone has already described the plot but has anyone mentioned the opening scene a butcher knife is stabbed through a wig and impaled on the grass in the front yard i'm guessing the bratty kid did it put never explained really trippy wish this had been a better written or thought out film because what we're left with if pretty daft and a movie that makes no sense isn't a clever movie just a poorly executed would like to see a cleaned up version and if there was any missing footage i would like to see if it would help otherwise this is an odd little film that is best if fast-forwarded through

spooks is enjoyable trash featuring some well directed sequences ridiculous plots and dialogue and some third rate have described this is a uk version of and one can see the similarities american version shares the weak silly plots but the execution is so much slicker sexier and i suspect people describe weak comedy as gentle comedy is gentle spy story hour the exact opposite of anything created by john le me smiley any day
this movie introduces quite an array of characters and their relationships in the first half-hour or so none of them generate any interest or positive response i waited for the intrigue to begin hoping things would get better and ended up sticking around until the bitter end but there was no reward for doing you want a synopsis look elsewhere to me the action isn't worth recounting not that the story was that bad i guess you could say i had some problems with the i thought it stunk a look at the credits will show you that a pretty strong cast here used to no avail most of the old pros in this flick do good jobs of the actors i hadn't seen much of before i especially liked deborah kara unger about all that i can find good to say about this picture
what starts out as an interesting story quickly disintegrates into nothing don't bother watching to the end hoping for an explanation of what is stalking the visitors there is no ending no explanation no resolution zip this could have been a good movie it they had purchased an entire script
alas poor hamlet i knew him dear reader and let me tell thee this version sucks i don't know who of all people put up the money for this flotsam but i hope that they're proud of themselves they took the classic play and turned it into the most boring melodrama imaginable this version is quite literally so bad that not even the presence of a great thespian like maximilian schell in the title role can save it this only redeeming quality is that it made great fodder for mike servo and crow had a lot of fun with this either way i'm sure that shakespeare had he been alive when they made this would not have wanted his name associated with it this hamlet is not even so bad it good just plain bad absolutely dreadful
well this film has certainly had a fair amount of hype from the buzz at the toronto film festival to gushing reviews on cbc radio a refreshing wacky hilarious indie movie apparently i'd been looking forward to it for can i put it this simply it sucked in a very big way an exercise in cinematic lameness that makes adam sandler look like a comic best it was mildly amusing and at worst coma inducing an amerterish script badly directed and shoddily edited into a ramshackle what was with the music being louder than the rest of the sound track that was about the only truly odd thing about you want to see a genuinely funny bizarre movie involving aliens then try repoman there is no comparison
as much as i dislike saying me too in response to other comments completely true that the first minutes of this film have nothing whatsoever to do with the endless dirge that comprises the following been banned somewhere doesn't make a film watchable just because it doesn't resemble a hollywood product does not make it yet in addition to no discernible plot than there are lots of muddy places in russia and many people even very old women drink lots of vodka a number of visuals are so unnecessarily nauseating i'm in to my second package of for spoilers well the film is so devoid of any narrative thread i couldn't write one if i waste your time or money and don't confuse this with good russian cinema
i had always been a big lynda carter-wonder woman fan so when the sci-fi channel ran this had to see was bitterly is a wonder woman movie in name doesn't wear the right costume must have refused to or had ordered major changes and the plot runs like a poor james none of the things that made the comic book heroine a success the superhuman strength or determined just one long bad don't even think cathy is all that attractive wouldn't waste your time on this
not that i want to be mean but this movie really surprised me a lot during the whole film i was is this movie all about i don't get the animations at all probably this movie will only be suitable for those who belongs to the during the film there is a group of people walked out after the movie many people said it frankly speaking i cannot believe that this movie was awarded the best children film award if you are thinking of watching this film i strongly recommend you not to you will regret it i'm not joking you will find that you are just wasting both your time and money of you go and watch it
simply not the quality i expected from morris brass eye and blue jam this is very much like a not so bad student film what concerns me in all this is why did it win a bafta morris makes fun of enshrined mediocrity rand in much of his work barley and yet with this piece is urinating down the backs of the talented and telling us its raining just hope as he has chosen a subject i would love to tackle humanity of terrorism four lions that he isn't going to cock that up wasting the opportunity to make a statement about the farce of mainstream ignorance and opinion on this emotive and heavily spun phenomena
after witty live-action george of the jungle i had high hopes for this flick major disappointment thread bare plot bad acting bad visual effects this film relied on lame one-liners idiotic and pointless product placement and the lamest most annoying side-kick in that gadget car thing i took two young kids to see it and they where bored out of their mind the only laugh received from this movie was bad standby of when needing a laugh show a guy getting it in the groin
this has the absolute worst performance from robert duval who sounds just like william buckley throughout the entire film his hammy melodramatic acting takes away from any dramatic interest i'm not sure if this was deliberate scene stealing or inadvertent but the only thing i can recall from a truly forgettable film this picture should be shown in every amateur acting class of an example of what not to do thank god duvall went on to bigger and better things and stopped trying to effect a cultured accent he is a good character actor but about it klaus is so much better his performance is muted and noteworthy
i truly despised this film when i saw it at the age of about or as i was a huge fan of robin williams and nothing he could do was bad until this this complete trash ruined robin for me for a long time i'm only recovering recently with his funny but serious part in fathers day but then he went on to create another mistake bicenntinial man i think it was called but the point is robin should be getting much better jobs by now and now he has returned to performing the slime that originated with this classic
cause crap the kind of movie that makes you want to go and smack the movie maker and say why horrible camera the times the camera tries to remain steady on one person and can't the dialog is ridiculous the acting is comical it looks like they took over a ghost town in the west to see if they could make a movie on the least amount of money possible i'd bet they used home video cameras to make this either that or most of the cameramen were drunk truly the trailers are more entertaining than the movie if you ever want to host a worst movie party bring this one want more at a wall
slasher films are often seen as the derivative repetitive and frankly unoriginal i happen to to be a horror movie fan but this film was just so poor words fail me the script is severely lacking the plot is ridiculous the acting astoundingly bad just an all round stinker that i wasted time of my life on this had all the entertainment value of a sequel to a film that was dire in the first place greenlit this only liked two things in this movie the first was the mask which was nice the second was the austrailian affinity with humourous yourself and avoid this hideous mess
i bought this at tower records after seeing the info-mercial about fifteen hundred times on comedy central i was actually really looking forward to watching this my god where did i go wrong now before i give my review let me just say that i am a person who can pretty much find the good in all movies hell i own over with that said the underground comedy movie ranks up there with the worst film i have ever seen i tried to give it a chance but not only was it not funny it had no point did not offend what-so-ever and was all around stupid god who in their right mind thought these pieces of crap were funny this is going right to the bottom of the bin
just another film that exploits gratuitous frontal male nudity awful acting plus the lovemaking scenes are the most un-sexy i've ever seen this is not about me not linking the idea of two young men making love since i'm as in mil nubes de paz julian hernandez directed an incredibly pretentious film with a story that makes enough argument for a short film of about five minutes but manages to make a hour film with it and this time there isn't even the issue of racism and commodification in the mexican gay community to talk about god gracious have mercy on us
this is easily one of the worst movies i've ever seen not scary or any of the other things suggested in the plot outline this movie is agonizingly slow and i was bored for almost all minutes while the acting is mediocre at best the biggest problem is the script which is poorly written slow and plodding with no real direction occasionally an eerie mood is set only to be broken by some useless line or event i'm not surprised that the entire cast was sick and throwing up between shots they did after all have to try and digest a terrible script as a huge fan of good horror movies i'm always irritated that something this bad gets made save yourself minutes you'll never get back
i love a good sappy love story i'm a guy but when i rented love story i prayed for the end to come as quickly and painlessly as possible and just the opposite for ali mcgraw as jenny alienated and irritated the heck out of me within the first minutes when we learn that she has been diagnosed with a life threatening illness i couldn't help but wonder if her death would be such a terrible loss for poor oliver or if anyone watching this film would even care if she didn't die her grating personality would probably have pushed oliver over the edge and eventually landed them in divorce love this movie but one of the worst of the
if you're a layman interested in quantum theory and string theory read the elegant universe by brian greene of columbia university and the universe in a nutshell by stephen hawking of for parts bombastic new age pontificator parts pseudoscientist parts real together until ingredients are indistinguishable from each other and spread on celluloid thin enough that there is no discernible suggestion barf bags
i think if they made any money make a complete turd bomb like this one the i need to get into the movie industry i wiped my ass on a piece of toilet paper and made a better script once watch when the guy is running through the tunnel they used the same feet of tunnel over and over and over again and never even changed the location of the stupid hanging think if i get the thrill of meeting the director of this gem of a movie i think i will pick a fight with him and start it by deficating on his think i need to puke now
what kind of a documentary about a musician fails to include a single track by the artist himself unlike ray or countless other films about music artists half the fun in the theater on the couch is reliving the great songs themselves here all the tracks are covers put on by uninteresting characters and these renditions fail to capture slow jazzy style more often the covers are badly sung folk versions interviews are as much or more with other musicians and figures rather than with cohen himself only rarely does the film feature cohen reading his own work like letters poems etc the movie really didn't capture much about the life story either or about his development through the years a huge disappointment for a big cohen fan
this film is awful the screenplay is bad the is script mediocre and even the sex scenes are worthless the thrill and intrigue of the original film are completely lacking this movie was shot in a dark shadowy and monochromatic style la war of the worlds which is so disappointing after the beauty of the original film greg brooding character displays one facial expression throughout the film the twists and turns of the original plot are woefully lacking here the few that do exist are simply anticlimactic the only highlight is sharon performance as catherine tramell faithfully continued in this sequel but it isn't enough to make up for the other shortcomings the only circumstance under which a basic instinct should be made would be if michael douglas agrees to join the cast
i watched me through this because i'm a fan of i don't think this is a flick she'll put on the back of her head shot photos i like gangsta flix but this wasn't even close the budget couldn't have been more than a few hundred dollars and that money was probably spent on the premise was interesting but the first victim died before you get the chance to care about her or won't bother saying who did what and how because it isn't worth the effort i'm only glad that because of my monthly rental plan at the local video store that i didn't have to actually pay for this before you flame on me i love movies i thought a lotta flix were good that some of you have jammed so for me to jam this tells you all you need to know
yuck and again i the original version of this movie was a well directed story of a man who was already dead and driving through purgatory the original movie had a lot to say and didn't go out of its way to say it and it had a naked chick on a version strikes me as something that a producer bought the rights to and then abandoned out of disinterest it looks as if a group of individuals consciously decided to fit it to the nineties and changed ethnicities and genders just to be cute the movie is not about a burnout about to commit suicide in a last act of defiance it is about a man trying to get to a hospital to see his was no reason for this movie to have been made other than to make me angry
the deceptive cover title and very small hidden print of power of prayer tricked me into renting this started out really well and pulled me in i really liked it between and of it the film started throwing in things that were not set up and made no sense my first thought was this is not written by someone who knows how to tell a story i ended up re-watching parts of the movie thinking i had missed the time i reached the last of the movie it was all boring annoying religion thumping dialog that made no sense said nothing and was annoying to listen to i turned off the sound and did a fast forward to the waste your time with this of dvds labeled whitlow films and level path i'm a practicing catholic
i was one of quite a few extras in this big bomb i just happened to be in the right place working safety for the race scenes at as it was know as back goodness my scene in in the first few minutes of the movie and i don't have to sit through the whole thing it was more of a big party than a movie set but hey the pay was to detail was not a strong point for this one but who was going to funny thing was seeing the cars in the track at the really slow speed and then in the movie speeded up to the what was close to normal lot of the scenes were changed as they were filmed i suppose to shave cost and every one was having such a good time who cared
the movie seemed to appeal me because of the new type of pokemon celebi but the plot was out of course and didn't have as an interest as the other movies it was a waste of money and time the same corny humor and cliche bad guys the movie was of no use to make if you wanted to make pokemon famous the movie should better not associated with animes such as dragonballz digimon or yu-gi-oh the drawing and settings are of no level rising to the standards of original anime it is a shame even to talk about this movie i bet pokemon fans will be disappointed with the outcome of the movie and give up on pokemon digimon is more of an anime and doesn't fall anywhere close to second movie is coming out late
this show seemed to be kinda good kyra sedgwick is an ok actress and i like police series but somewhere in the production this program went awfully wrong of all the writers should have more suspects than one you know who did it every time that makes it boring the main character is unbelievably annoying and its not believable in any way i know they wanted her to be tough but shes mean stupid and a bad chief the crimes are uninteresting and bland and its just lame all the way as stated above i hate it in all this was a big disappointment and very bad indeed
there was not one original idea in this story themes were pulled from various sources a few being the ninth gate in the mouth of madness carpenter film and the ring it even went as far as featuring the same damn glowing circle from the ring and using it as the namesake the soundtrack by cody carpenter was all but lifted from suspiria hopefully no one will oppose this comment by spewing the word homage around yes i saw that the theater was playing deep red claiming an homage would be a bullshit cop-out this was bottom-of-the-barrel throwing gore and disturbing imagery into the pot does not make a good horror film carpenter used to know that he should fade into obscurity or acquire a time machine
saw a trailer for this on another video and decided to rent when it came out boy was i disappointed the story is extremely boring the acting from christopher walken is bad and i couldn't care less about the characters aside from really wanting to see husband get thrashed christopher role is such a throw-away what a tease
this is by far the worst movie i have ever watched i've seen some pretty awful movies in my time but this ones takes the cake no wait i mean the the whole damn bakery it is so bad that i believe a word to describe the way you will feel after watching this atrocity has yet to be created please just do yourself a favor if you ever get the urge to watch this and watch thirty minutes of that annoying purple dinosaur barney then multiply that thirty times fold and you would still only get a small fraction of the horror you would be in store for in summation i guess you really can call it a horror movie but only if you're willing to be scared senseless by the worst acting in the business and utterly pointless rating disgusting
i have made it my personal mission to go after those responsible for this film i even got the rental company to give me my money back because i argued that they perpetrated false not enough that the movie itself is a but the cover art is what sold me i've done better make-up effects on my children at halloween than what the movie actually depicts versus the cover art can you say raccoon not going to waste more of my time by going into the full details but come on the main character is an cop who was born and raised in alabama but has a german accent beyond insulting
i was bored around so i watched this movie and i could not stop laughing everything was so ridiculous the way the kids were acting like they were older than just cracked me up one of the kids had a ring that supposedly killed people after or so years it gave me the impression that he wanted to be a pretty hard to take little kids seriously especially when it has to do with eating worms they act like everything is such a big deal like if billy main character doesn't eat the worms then the world will is a good movie for little kids the fact that a year old says penis but not for teens or adults who don't want to waste their time
in the future of a governmental committee headed by howard hesseman is holding hearings on first uncensored network they sample programming that play as a series of skits i can name the good skit movies on one hand not using my thumb amazon women on the moon kentucky fried movie the meaning of life and mr mondo video notice how i didn't mention tunnel vision the reason for that is that this movie is death in cinematic form none of the skits are even remotely funny or even the least bit clever it takes some sort of great ineptitude on the film makers part to not even get one laugh out of grade f candy dody dorn goes full frontal
one previous reviewer called this film pure visual joy i am wondering if saw the same film that i did high art had to have the most relentlessly depressing interiors since seven one can almost forgive sheedy and mitchell for the clich√© of going to a for their first time of course before they do that one has to watch opium-den parties inhabited by people who are not apparently gainfully employed but can somehow support a flourishing drug habit not to mention the icy stares from those familiar movie types the at start who are well aware they're going to be thrown over sometime in the next minutes or so the movie also states that the sheedy character has retired from professional photography for ten years now what did she do retire at age twenty
this is the biggest load of crap that i have seen in a long time the last time i hated a movie so much was whilst watching days later and magnolia there is absolutely no point to this movie except to see some really sick and twisted scenes gillian anderson relieving herself on the side of the road and every single sentence of dialog having to use the f word at least a couple of times in it it has extremely cheap acting and is very low budget my friend and i eventually turned off the movie after about half an hour we had tried to give it a chance but nothing could save this crud do not watch it
perhaps the worst thing about carlos comedy is that every joke needs to be followed with an insult at the people in the crowd that aren't laughing if anybody insecure a comedian who won't shut up about his again perhaps the worst thing about carlos comedy is that he doesn't get off his free speech high horse if you want to be funny just make a joke don't explain all the reasons why you're saving the american way with your failed attempts at generating actually the worst thing about carlos comedy is that it substitues meanspirited jabs at ethnicities for legitimate humor avoid this like the plague
it looks to me as if the creators of the class of nuke em high wanted it to become a cult film but it ends up as any old high school b-movie only tackier the satire feels totally overshadowed by the extremely steretyped characters very un-funny even for a turkey
ok don't let my summary fool you this movie sucks hard but the worst movie ever this movie was terrible in ways people shouldn't have to rack their brains to describe but it is in no way worse than manos the hands of fate hobgobblins horrors of spider island or a small handful of movies as a review the movie sucks terrible don't see it with out mst or you may develop health problems but there are worse movies
this movie may seem scary on commercials but the actual movie was a reason to vomit this is a below below average lower than that and has no plot i mean every house can make you feel scared and sure a dead japanese woman would scare the poop out of you but so what make a movie that would appeal to watchers and not just show images of scared people and some hair japanese woman can you say horrible rip-off of samara ring don't get me started with the dead child not even that scary so what he has a cat and he can imitate it big freaking deal just bury the poor zombies and save some lives that have the potential of being harmed by the grudge yuck
i have been a huge lynn peterson fan ever since her breakthrough role in the blockbuster movie far north and even though i loved her in her one other film slow where she plays francis this is by far and away her strongest as i'm sure you all know should plays the critical role of other than amazing performance i'm afraid this movie doesn't really have much going for wait there was one other thing the amazing creativity of the editing to remove profanity for tv viewers memorable lines like you son-of-a-gun you son-of-a-witch shoot and well forget does anyone know where i can get another lynn peterson poster
some moron who read or saw some reference to angels coming to earth decided to disregard what he'd heard about the offspring of humans and angels being larger than normal humans reinventing them as mythical giants that were feet tall is beyond ridiculous there was some historical references to housing and furniture in parts of the world that were much larger than would be needed for standard humans these were supposedly built on a scale that would lend itself to a to foot human somewhat supporting the david and goliath tale from the bible there is no mention in any historical references to buildings or artifacts that would support the idea of a foot tall being if i was rating this movie on my own scale it would have been a negative value instead of a one
i have seen over movies and this one stands out as one of the worst movies that i have ever seen it is a shame that they had to associate this garbage to the angels song my back if you have to make a choice between watching this movie and painful dental work i would suggest the dental work
very dull obvious tedious exorcist rip-off featuring a doberman with red eyes the extent of the special effects in this made-for-tv cheapie richard crenna is about as animate as a chew toy very dress music only add to the torture should put you to sleep almost as fast as the corpse vanishes or the blue hand practically worthless moocow says eaghhh what a stinky dog
sorry fulci fans but i could not get through this one the soundtrack was about as annoying as they come the acting was puerile the story has been done and done and the direction was non-existent honestly looked like a film project but i've seen some of those and they actually look better than this did it appears to have been so underfunded they couldn't afford anything not a dop not a director no one who even remotely had a clue what acting was it was a very poor cinematic experience one of my was about the worst suck-fest i've seen next to terror toons which is second only to killer klowns from outer space i've nothing else to say about rates a fiend
ursula andress naked body is one of those things that make you believe in god the other two women the one who plays the maid have great bodies as well then why is the higher grade that i can give to a film with such quality and quantity of nudity only out of because to get to unbelievable body we have to sit through a movie that is otherwise unfunny and boring in mind that i watched the full version not the american one which probably cuts out a lot of the extraneous material in typical italian-comedy tradition most of the characters are exaggerated caricatures army freak the latin lover the constant drunk the naive maid that are not funny simply overacted final word watch this but keep your finger on the fast-forward button you're gonna need it
i rarely comment on films but i've read the other comments and i cannot believe that there are people applauding this celluloid rubbish i know there are certain people who have their own agenda but lets take it on merit poorly acted badly shot and the story felt as the director was making it up as he was going along i am not going to focus on the sexual aspect of the film involving little kids as the makers of the film obviously knew what they wanted and what their audience would want all i can say is it is a terrible film the content is poor and offensive the production is amateurish and i am glad they could not make a film like this legally today
to call this anything at all would be an insult to everything else some expletives might describe it but still too positively normally one ignores this kind of rubbish but it was so stupid that one can but despair would have though that even americans and commercial tv-stations would have given this piece of a miss but as the germans say gegen die dummheit kaempfen die goetter selbst vergebens
an idiotic dentist finds out that his wife has been unfaithful so no new story lines here however the authors managed to create a stupid disgusting film if you enjoy watching kids vomiting or seeing a dentist imagining that he is pulling all his teeth out in a bloody horror-type go see rent the film if not move on to something else fair lady anyone
i was excited to view a film in the competition but after the presentation i was total disappointed and furious too much blood too much time too much themes for nothing the spanish civil war like every war was horrible the revenge a very human behavior not pretty at all is shown in uncountable films and plays as well as the relations between homosexuals and the scepticism in spain about catholicism but what mr villaronga try is a pseudo tragedy that can belongs to the worst of the history it is really a pity to see angela molina in this movie i advise nobody under no circumstances to go to see this film
pretty disappointing prequel to the first two films got none of the suspense of the first nor the interest of the second by concentrating on the guys who run the cube it basically takes away any of the sense of tension inside the cube as we simply don't care about the characters inside much of the film is simply boring and it only becomes truly terrible with the introduction of the glass-eyed superior and the green-eyed crazy marine after that though it just descends into over-the-top unintentional hilarity the ending is fitting though tying it back into the first one in an indirect way the script is terrible the acting mediocre at best and the direction unimpressive a much lesser follow-up
this movie was the most horrible movie watching experience i have ever had to endure and what is worse is the fact that i had to watch it and didn't have the opportunity to stop it because it was for school admittedly the storyline was i found the acting terrible the exception was marianne jean-baptiste i thought her performance was wonderful she was the only highlight without her i doubt i would have been able to bear watching the film every time i hear somebody say daarling i cringe i nearly attacked a customer the other day because they said it it made me remember one of the worst one and a half hours of my apologise if this has offended anybody i am only expressing my opinion
first of all i have to say i have worked for blockbuster and have seen quite a few movies to the point its tough for me to find something i haven't seen taking this into account i want everyone to know that this movie was by far the worst film ever made it made me pine for gigli my daughter and any other piece of junk you've ever seen belyt must be out of his mind i've only found one person who liked it and even they couldn't tell me what the movie was about if you are able to decipher this movie and are able to tell me what it was about you have to either be the writer or a fortune teller because any other way a person could figure this crap the love of g-d stay away
i thought this movie seemed like a case study in how not to make a movie for the most part since i am a filmmaker i give it a for problems remain from beginning to end with the plot being extremely predictable using bits and pieces of most if not all previous successful war stories the computer generated graphics were too much like viewing a video game at points and there seemed to be no attempt by the director to add some realistic quality to the story i was interested in the budget to get an idea of what he had to work with but did not find that seemed like this project pushed the limits of a low budget movie too far resulting in a production that drags the viewer along with the story without their imagination being engaged the actors weren't bad but the plot needs more innovation
belmondo is a tough cop he goes after a big-time drug dealer by henry silva normally a great villain see machine but here he is clearly dubbed and because of that he lacks his usual charisma he goes to the scuzziest places of paris and marseilles asks for some names beats up some people gets the names goes to more scuzzy places asks for more names beats up more people etc the whole movie is punch after punch after punch it seems that the people who made it had no other ambition than to create the french equivalent of dirty harry belmondo who was here does perform some good stunts at the beginning apart from those le marginal is a violent episodic trite shallow and forgettable cop movie
aka mondays in the have no idea what i just watched three men wander aimlessly and drink grousing about everything and at everyone in their path this is supposed to be a drama but what it is is a total waste of film without a single redeeming have read reviews touting the performances herein as wonderful beautiful and heroic i'm afraid i cannot agree unless these men were supposed to come off as the dumbest most ignorant proto-humans who ever in all this was not a movie it wanders throughout and loses everyone but the audience i've watched this three times and cannot for the life of me see what anyone sees in this garbage there is nothing profound here whatsoever rates a fiend
this apology for a movie is about absolutely nothing rachel griffiths must have needed the money the film must have been made on a very low budget because the lighting was non existent i made a vow if i ever see pete postlesumthingor other i'll commit suicide i'd be happy to know if there was a plot or script my biggest regret is i wasted my time watching this rubbish
after watching this on the episode i have to wonder how many movies this film borrows from it seems to combine elements of logans run farenheight final sacrifice and at least several others at one point i was really expecting cris makepease to call lee majors rowsdower wonder if the director has any clue how many holes there are in the plot like the fact that even though gas is unavailable there is plenty of it in abandoned gas stations and the stations are located close enough together to keep an race car going all the way across the country
if you ask me the first one was really better one look at sarah m g she is real mean cruel girl look at amy adams she is just little fool hanging around she is nothing people don't adore her second sebastian was cute and hot in first movie now he is baby face story is not that good and i do not understand why didn't they make this one first it is the beginning loosy actors nothing with story this is not cruel this is playing first one has better actors better story and its mean i think that the music is better in cruel intentions and the music is better in cruel intentions it is not the worst movie i saw but in compaer with first one its one big big big nothing
i couldn't watch more than minutes of it a great combination of really bad acting and really bad directing the shots used are disgusting they broke the degrees angle all the time my head hurts try to watch that load of you know what dirt on the mystery machine window make you see light from the lighting on the what else so badly framed all the time just make you want to scream at that lady directing there i only directed short films but i'm pretty sure i'd be way better than that directing a feature film the story is unbelievable just the long french kissing scene at the beginning tell you that gonna be pretty awful so pretty much try to avoid this really bad movies at all cost it'll save you the bucks or so for the rental and that hour of your life you'll never get back
i decided to watch this serial after seeing the endless adverts for it on the bbc in the weeks prior to it starting i watched it despite the fact that i don't like the pretentious kind of stuff that alan hollinghurst writes to his fans but i think we have a case of the new clothes with this work i admit that the acting is excellent it is beautifully shot and i was reasonably entertained by it i found that the storyline was extremely thin and after watching all three episodes feel very unsatisfied with this rather empty production the explicit gay sex that the media droned on about has all been done before on tv several times so it was nothing very shocking i'm afraid full marks for production values but low ones for i'm afraid
the underground comedy movie is perhaps one of the worst comedies i've ever seen i should have known it was going to be bad when the box had the phrase guaranteed to offend written on it meaning that the filmmakers were going to focus more on grossing you out than making you movie is an amateurish jumble of childish skits bad characters and worse jokes from the pathetic bat-man sketch to the painfully unfunny arnold shvollenpecker skit they just aren't funny the few skits that are a little funny are few and far between watching micheal clark duncan play a gay virgin for example but even they go on too long and get ruined from vince ineptness at the underground comedy movie underground bury it
i love anthony hopkins as an actor so i was very interested to see how he would do as a i could not have been more disappointed by this move the movie was so disjointed and the cinematography was so over done to the point i wanted to pull the plug out of the wall the actors were very good but it was such a waste of talent not all actors are cut out to be writers or directors and clearly mr hopkins falls into this category of all the movies i have ever seen in my years this is absolutely the worst movie ever please do us all a favor mr hopkins and stick to acting which you are excellent at and leave the writing and directing to those who are talented in those areas if i could give this movie a rating less than one i certainly would
who what where when why the acting was terrible very robotic rehearsed i have seen all of the actors in this film in better roles the screenplay was very elementary by the end of this film the story line was tied up and jeane claude lamarre should be tied up too so that he never attempts to another film
ok the plot is wait you got me there is no true discernible plot here just a string of optically fogged sex scenes strung together by scenes of photographers taking pictures of pretty ladies a combination of the two then a demon comes around kills the men rapes and kills the women and waxes poetic about the meaning of life moronic special effects bad acting and bizarre philosophy aside you get what you expect from a film with a title like this i guess it would have to be cup of tea just not mine as i have yet to see a good kazuo gaira komizu directed extras subtitled interview with director kazuo komizu part is on the entrails of a beautiful woman dvd and theatrical grade f
i love the episode where jim becomes the greenman it is great when jim tosses that little person through the window the look on his face is priceless then when he starts to address the priest in his behalf only to find out that she has become the pee-woman great writing and great casting along with great acting makes this a must see i am attempting to find a certain photo from that episode i'd like to use it as my avatar on a message board because i think the greenman is hilarious does anyone know where i can download a photo of jim as the greenman can anyone point me in the right direction to find such a photo
poor michael madsen he must be kicking himself to know folks have found out about this horrible flick i really can't think of anything worse i have ever seen except amateur porn that bad and all here wooden acting bad script crappy moral ending you hate it and it is in this question is who the hell put into this piece of doggy doo at least we could have seen sister virginia nude in a scene but i don't think even that would save this a cool guy that has made some exception movies i want to know what wacky church sponsored this piece of crapola
they made me watch this in school and it was terrible the movie is outdated the episodes become confusing because fact is combined with fiction to make the story more teachers talked about it as a treat but really it was a painfully boring have read that very few people who appear in this are actors but most of them them do what they do in the movie in real accounts for cheesy acting very often also very often the story becomes mildly outrageous and far-fetched i don't like the way some of the lines were written and wish they had more meaning to them though it was written to be educational funny suspenseful and hip it ended up being boring dry far-fetched and old i hope no one takes time to watch this movie because you would be just fine not seeing it
i watched this movie last week sometime and had the biggest laugh i've had in a long while the plot of the film is pretty dumb and convoluted in a badly crafted way the only plus to be found anywhere in the film are corey impressive abs alexandra paul think her name is horrendous as the wife who has a history of depression ted mckenzie is gross and his a twit on top of it all and as if the fact that you think having sex with her son isn't enough they throw in needless sax solos at every opportunity the end and climax of this film is absolutely abysmal and also laughable i mean who the hell wants to carry the child of a con who tried to make you think he was your son and that you were having an incestuous relationship with him
yes this movie make me feel real horror when i realized that i paid for it and spent more than hour of my life trying to watch it the bald guy just give me the impression of being a psycho junkie actor and the girl is the worst actress i ever seen believe me if you appreciate your time avoid this movie i understand a movie requires money to be created and some movies do not have that money but that is no justification for a stupid plot and bad acting i'm always supporting independent movies when it deserves the support but movies like this makes a bad name for this kind of movies i'm still traumatized i will not trust in any nice cover anymore
this has to be the worst and i mean worst biker movie ever made and saying a lot because the line of stinkers is long and at least we know what happened to ginger after she was rescued from island a frightened looking tina was probably afraid someone would see this a stranded motorist who is tormented by the most repulsive motorcycle gang in film history but don't worry fans batman i mean adam west as a hick-town doctor comes to the rescue pow crush boom holy toledo batman only good points of this bomb are some cute women some laughable fight scenes and the still sexy tina louise
honestly if anyone has a brain not positive say about this movie what so ever lost my renting this i'd rather laugh at will smith saying if you got a dream you got to protect it the actors must've been bored or had no fame at the time even matthew mc conahay you spell was better then all the actors in this movie when he played a psycho in texas chainsaw if you see this movie and have anything good to say you iq must be extremely low with such bad taste in movies it hurts thank the truth has been yourself from the misery rejects now a classic
i just finished a marathon of this series and it became agonising to watch as it progressed from the fictionalising of the historical elements to awful accent in later episodes the show just slumps the further it goes if you are looking for some low quality production generalised fluff then i could recommend season but avoid anything after that it degenerates into being one step from a soap opera with increasingly worse story lines and old film is by far the best of any form of entertainment with the colditz name attached to it and even that is not what one could hope for
not even worth watching this tacky spoiler ruins everything about annie the characters seem almost cheapened by the poorly written storyline and they low quality feeling to the production it was very clearly made for tv yet if i found it on my television i would flick it straight over the children in the film do an alright job yet the adults acting is unbelievable and so the movie fails to really draw you in this film lacked the numbers thats made the original brilliant and truly does take the shine of the annie we all love johnson as annie is at times annoying and over cannot convince yourself that she truly is annie the differences in character appearance continued to irritate me throughout the duration of the film sad to say this sequel was a total flop
action violence sex and coarse language are the things that the characters do during the whole movie and everything they do is done without reason mark l lester is for his violent the base the story is weird but stupid the actors play their stupid characters very not telling they are stupid but i mean they are very bad actors another low-budget unknown b series action movie if you saw something like operation delta force drive the patriot sanctuary or something like these bad movies from the same kind than rent by the way don't rent any of the movies i give it a half out
sheesh what a dreadful movie dodgy camera work a script with more corn than and acting so hammy you could open a pig farm with it cap it all it doesn't know which audience to aim at we have cornel wilde or is that corny wilde getting on his soap box about the hazards of smoking any time someone lights a cigarette dear oh dear and in another awkward scene we have the baddie lobo forcing his ahem if you will male friend to do a striptease dressed in a bikini try explaining that one to the in an overly contrived treasure island-cum-jaws type storyline and the result is a film so unintentionally funny enjoyable i shouldn't expect a special edition dvd any time soon though
from everything i'd read about the movie i was excited to support a film with a christian theme everything about the movie was very unprofessionally done especially the writing without good writing a movie doesn't have a chance the said in an interview that he didn't want to give away how the title relates to the story believe me it was no big surprise i kept waiting for the adult back-story to unfold but it never did as someone who has gone through a divorce i was very disappointed this movie would have been no comfort to me when i first went through the emotional turmoil that divorce can bring to your life as a christian
this was an atrocious waste of my time no plot the acting was so far below par it should be used as an exemplar in acting classes of what not to do it is merely a commercial rip-off of the earlier universal soldier which also scrapes the bottom of the acting barrel its sad that vd needs to assert his ego every few years and sadder still that people will pay good money to sit thru it this kind of schlock gives martial arts movies a bad name by comparison it makes segall norris and arnold look almost vd should take the leslie nielson track and do send-ups of his genre at least then we could be laughing with him instead of at him
born raised and educated in scotland i was appalled at this disgusting portrayal of a man who was no more nor less than a cattle rustler worse yet the thread of the entire movie was sex in one form or another by implication or verbally to view it one would think that century scotland was populated by a bunch of sex perverts and homosexuals lange was a joke acting as the young mother at age but liam neeson was even worse taking a bath in a scottish loch is not commonplace as they portrayed him but it did give them yet another opportunity to demonstrate how sexually driven we were save your money and watch pinnochio
i think this is awful produced and directed movie benicio del toro shouldn't work in production of movies he should put accent on his acting and it steven soderbergh missed the whole point of the idea about revolution about ideals and most important about life of che guevara and so on camera is awful like someone with day working experience is shooting with it music is i don't there some music in the movie i will not recommended this piece of sh to no one just wasting about hours in front of the tv or whatever i can't figure out how can someone rate this movie more than stars don't watch please save yourself from this misery of movie
i figured that any horror film with orson welles in it would be weird necromancy sure was but it was a little too weird for own good the film does indeed have a creepy feel as it deals with a coven of in a small town and a young attempt to escape them the director though seems to be deliberately trying to confuse the audience by using flashbacks and dream sequences by the finale there are too many unanswered questions worse as the story is so confusing pretty hard to root for any of the characters it seems odd that welles would agree to headline this film especially since he doesn't have that much to do maybe someday they will put out a tape of the outtakes and bloopers from this movie now that would really be fun
this is one of those films that i could only sit through once charlotte henry is fine in fact all the actors were fine the problem was in the script the dialog the direction the editing the sets and the special effects granted this was but it really creaked part of the problem is that actors like richard arlen gary cooper fields and cary grant are not recognizable faces cried for a recognition that was not forthcoming the movie just clumped along with no cohesion much of lewis carrols spirit humor and continuity are missing what a pity such a great book i would recommend version
alan alda plays real-life sports illustrated writer george plimpton who was once invited to join the detroit lions football team as an honorary member rather wan uncompelling drama curiously tempered with fantasy director alex march takes an interesting tack on this material shooting it in a quasi-documentary fashion macho commentary and yet giving the tale a touch of capraesque whimsy still by bringing out the cinematic flashiness in this set-up he turns the main narrative into a jumble smug uncharismatic performance is another handicap though the supporting cast is filled with real-life pro-athletes scintillating lauren hutton as that for a fantasy from
one of those classics held up next to deep throat and behind the green it was clever but the female lead isn't that attractive and sex isn't that hot but if not for this film porn would not have blossomed into what it is reems was the ron jeremy of his day worth a look if you're a fan
it was pointed out in a now deleted post from another imdb user that anyone who might see the medusa touch should be warned about a scene eerily reminiscent of the sept terrorist attacks in nyc but i hope anyone reading this will consider this warning despite an interesting pedigree elliott kastner produced harper and the long goodbye co-producer arnon milchan co-produced the oscar-nominated confidential and screenwriter john briley won an oscar for gandhi and an international cast i found the medusa touch to be a heavy-handed unintentional laugh riot it was a poorly directed horribly written and acted mess it tried to capitalize on the telekinetic thrillers genre the movie fails on many counts please consider carrie and the underrated the fury directed by brian depalma they were two entertaining and exciting thrillers that dealt with the same subject matter
not just the plot alone that makes this movie an instant turn-off for bored audiences the terrible direction with a horrible script and mistakes left and right that makes this too agonizing to watch i'm sorry but i do not see the fun in this just the thrill of pointing the many mistakes and stupid one-liners well i'm wondering how dumb the directors think of their producing company when this movie was first introduced probably as dumb as that sheriff who dove into the pickup truck full of antifreeze with a gaping bloody wound oops did i forget to mention this not only a poor actor but also can shrug off an impalement with a load of antifreeze drenching the exposed flesh i guess he kind of forgot when he won a not-so-thrilling victory over the snowman
half the reviews were good so i took a chance for sure priscilla barnes had some sex talk but it wasn't much the whole plot later that she may be the other actress mother the documentary maker falling for the young woman is stretching it its not funny its not that raunchy its not much of anything but a waste of time boogie nights was based on real people that were in the adult industry this is based on nothing that ever happened in the industry it could have shocked with whats popular today in adult films mocking todays gonzo videos and that big orgy that they had minutes to shoot what a joke a bigger orgy has been done bigger better decades ago in the early
this had high intellectual main lead intends to give a deep meaningful voice over for his frames of mind naturally and he was certainly influenced by the method the script and the direction were worthwhile did give stunning results here the story is it moves too could edit at least minutes pointless flashbacks-and the plot line would not be changed at times very doubtful that bruce dern believes in his uncle character and his portraying often verges on interesting side is only skimmed relationship young we admit that the hero is himself some kind of when he says to the young kid that he would let nobody do harm to welcome tenderness botched and only the final scene returns to to the at close range has two great actors walken and sean penn also an offbeat movie but my hitchcockometer points sullenly towards zero throughout
an anthology is always risky business and i think this endeavor should be praised a lot of talent involved here a great many talented actors directors and writers unfortunately i couldn't really enjoy this movie based on three issues i of all the segments vary incredibly in tone and quality and unfortunately some of them clash with the others several segments feel underdeveloped to me like seeds of good stories that never come to fruition i'm not talking about happy endings here even an ending period but rather they lack even basic development or even solid setups that draw you in but not least i did not feel new-york and its inhabitants were properly you're left with is high-brow short films that may still be of interest to some but will leave the average viewer unsatisfied
the premise while not quite ludicrous was definitely ridiculous what should have occurred by the second encounter with tritter was that tritter should simply be wasted house hires some guy and de-physicalizes tritter in real life tritter would have been hauled up for harassment the rectal thermometer episode would have been exposed in court providing motive and opportunity and the hospitals lawyers would have made mincemeat out of tritter and the particular department he worked for he would be in prison as would anyone complicit in the harassment of house chase foreman cameron wilson and cuddy the lawsuit would have won house a tasty settlement enough to keep him supplied with vicadin well into his old age while tritter would wind up somewhere driving a cab trying to rehabilitate himself by doing good for people for two years before people tumbled to the fact that they'd seen it all before
if you have beloved actors peter falk rip torn george segal and bill cobbs you don't need billy burke coolio or any other distractions massive talent is totally wasted in three days to vegas with the blame falling squarely on the script my vacation films are about as interesting as this misguided road movie if you want to see how to utilize a veteran cast with a good script check out the crew there really are no redeeming factors here and watching these wonderful actors struggling with such weak material is a crime i wanted to like it but the shallow script cheats the audience by essentially giving the actors nothing to work with merk
this is one of those movies where i wish i had just stayed in the film is quite frankly boring what story there is is very flimsy and you pretty much have to guess at it the film indulges itself with pretentious camera techniques that seem intent on causing migraines and makes it look like a student film did i say it was boring already if all the characters had suddenly died at the end of the movie i would not have cared less as i had no emotional attachment to any of are about good minutes in this movie but that was about it this is the first time i have ever considered walking out of a cinema during a performance but i held on believing that it had to get better i was sort of film you could threaten naughty children with
it is incredible yes someone before me wrote that it was a time wasting to seat and watch this film it is don't do so i'm totally rankled i liked wesley snipes and i founded funny that he played his meaning in a movie anyway i wanted to see this film home only of course but now after i am absolutely disappointed it was his worst movie ever inwatchable bad actor-play bad cameraman bad scenario only one good think that wonderful girl must be a manikin surely eeeeh mb lines minimum i don't want to waste you're time anymore to read my opinion i hope i was clear and under-stable because english is not my native method of speaking so have grate time and see good films like i try too peace
omg the only reason i'm giving this movie a instead of a is because tom hanks is funny as an elvis-in-the-box apart from that how did this halfway decent cast sign on to do such a lame movie maybe it seemed like a good idea at the time there are no laughs to mention the stereotypes are pathetic the cast is wasted the direction is amateurish now that i think about it most of the blame probably lies with the director joel zwick he brings out nothing but flat performances from all involved don't waste your time like i did but then i enjoy a good train wreck geez now the system is telling me i need more here ya go this movie should be called return to sender okay now that was funnier than anything in the movie
i didn't know willem dafoe was so hard up for bucks that he'd disgrace himself with such shocking hamming in this monstrosity hell i'll donate that money that i was going to send to ethiopia if that desperate i have never seen such a pathetic and disgusting film for a long paid for this they are either pulling some tax scam or insane a old would be ashamed of the plot and i'd rather get cancer than sit through more than the hour i suffered already everybody involved should be locked up for a year in the sodomy wing of a third world prison avoid at all costs i'd give it minus if
terrible film made on a budget of about very obvious miniature sets used poor acting and an awful storyline concerning aliens who use discarded meat from a butcher shop as fuel for their spaceship the film contains some blood enough to disturb and a character with an eggbeater replacing one of his hands you read that saving grace was a song performed at the talent show that for irony by a wave band that i think was called i'm a heat seeking missile other than that this is not worth your time not even on a so bad good level watch if you are into cheesy alien films but anyone else should steer clear out of
the movie is basically a boring string of appalling clich√©s which do not offer a real cross-cultural insight the middle eastern leg of the journey is described in a particularly irritating way there obviously are mud brick villages dirt tracks in the middle of the desert women clad in black robes and belly dancers i wonder how camels and date palm trees were missing from the whole picture the personality of the two main characters is very clumsily sketched and many situations are hardly credible original idea might have been interesting but at the end of the day if you are looking for cultural insight you should skip this movie
this was a truly bad film the character cole played by michael moriarty was the biggest reason this flopped the actor felt that conjuring up an unbelievably awkward southern drawl would make this character more evil it didn't after about minutes i had wished for a speech therapist to make an appearance this would have added some badly acted unsympathetic characters razor thin plot
the cat in the hat is just a slap in the face film mike myers as the cat in the hat is downright not funny and mike myers could not have been any worse this is his worst film he has ever been in the acting and the story was just terrible i mean how could they make the most beloved stories by dr seuss be made into film and being one of the worst films of all-time and such a disappointment i couldn't have seen a more worst film than this besides maybe baby geniuses but this film is just so bad i can't even describe how badly they made this film bo welch should be fired or the writer should outlook no stars f
this is one of the dumbest films i've ever seen it rips off nearly ever type of thriller and manages to make a mess of them not a single good line or character in the whole mess if there was a plot it was an afterthought and as far as acting goes nothing good to say so ill say nothing i honestly cant understand how this type of nonsense gets produced and actually released does somebody somewhere not at some stage think oh my god this really is a load of shite and call it a day its crap like this that has people downloading illegally the trailer looks like a completely different film at least if you have download it you haven't wasted your time or money don't waste your time this is painful
what the hell of a d-movie was that bad acting bad special effects and the worst i ever came across the only cool thing here was coolio who had a nice cameo as a freaked out cop however the rest of the film is awful and boring not even so bad you can laugh about it just plain crap and whoever compares this to the evil dead series might as well compare tomb raider to indiana jones ok at least there was angelina jolie in tomb raider out of
absolutely awful movie utter waste of music is so loud that you cannot understand speech well if you really listen closely whatever they speak is actually work is bad editing is not present background score gives a headache action is shoddy dialogs are unintelligible acting is abysmal and well kareena used to look like a wrestler now she looks like a starved wrestler hell you can slim down but you cannot gain spending three hours watching a movie i want to like it but this movie would not even allow me that pleasure if you want to torture yourself go ahead watch this
there have been plenty of unknown movies or movies given bad reviews that i really liked this was not one of was overacted and used camera techniques that made me feel like i was watching a soap opera it was ludicrously predictable and took most of the movie to get going then left you asking it once i decided not to take the movie too seriously and watch it from a purely corny point of view it became more enjoyable this is one movie that would have wound up on if it was still on
the acting is bad ham all the jokes are superficial and the target audience is clearly very young children assuming they have below average iqs i realize that it was meant for kids but so is malcom in the middle yet they still throw in adult humor and should we expect from a show lead by bob saget the only comedian in existence who is less funny than a ball hitting a groin which is probably why he stopped hosting funniest home do not let your kids watch this show unless you want to save money on college expose your kids to stupidity and they will grow up dumberer
it just seems to run true to form any movie starring dolph lundgren is bad i don't know if it is the fact that the storyline in full of holes or that dolph is such a bad actor no spoiler here he seems to overdue the pushing and shoving and grabbing and touching thing in this movie in my opinion it is a wonder that some of these projects find venture capital to get in the can and to the theatre
this weekend just passed i watched weeks later which was very good after that i watched this film have tell you it is one of the most boring so called horror you could ever watch the scenes were unrealistic there was no script and no plot the alien creature was unreal and the fight scenes mild compared to a school yard fight and to make it worse the guy named cody had an uncontrollable loose filthy tongue which distracts attention from the main about this movie rather go and watch weeks mesake c
i have not seen the first film and if it anything like this have no great desire to just watched it a few hours ago i am struggling to remember a thing about it what i remember main plot seems to be a group of very annoying people stay at a house with that dodgy old woman from friday the and are stalked by plank of wood people die the film ends i am starting a law suit against the person who sold me this film as i want compensation for the missing time in my life will pay u to take this film off my wait i already gave it away to a friend
look the third one so you already know bad and maniac cop wasn't good enough to warrant the second installment so you know even worse but how much worse awful approaching maniac cop goes on a killing spree a reporter exclaims what happened here can only be described as a black rainbow of rainbows are not black and can never be rainbows are harmless and can never inflict pain or death a news reporter one valuable to his agency might find another way to describe the aftermath of a killing spree a black rainbow of death is not the only way to describe the given is what you're in for
to overcome the death of his wife an old man does what anyone in his position would naturally do least in a peter greenaway movie he and his son populate their home with eight and a half has no legs women and embark on a sexual odyssey this being a greenaway film there is lots of pretentious and uninteresting blabbering and of course there is unnecessary male nudity in fact the father and son share a bed sleeping in the nude gross besides who wants to see an old guy full frontal for those who are not into the homo-erotic scene one of the women likes to do the nasty with horses there is no story just a random collection of dull scenes
anyone who loved the two classic novels by edward ormondroyd will be disappointed in this film all the magic and romance have been modernized out of his original story of a girl who does a good deed for a mysterious old lady and given three in return three what not three wishes but three rides into the on a rickety first novel is time at the top the second is all in good time
a boring movie about a boring town in the how can anyone think this is a classic the producer pretty much ended his career by pushing his girlfriend cybil shepard into several movies that were way above her acting ability i think this movie gives an insight to how bad peter future movies were going to be cybil career took a dive after being in several movies that peter bogdonovich produced it wasn't until moonlighting that her career started to come back i thought the acting was poor rendition of the graduate i have noticed that this movie hasn't been shown in the us the only place i have watched it was overseas in europe late at night
i think i've seen this sort of thing before college graduates not realizing they have it pretty damn good all the while complaining that their lives movie is highly derivative of the big chill and reality bites from what i can make of it they practically have the same anything good came out of this snore-fest it was the music that was far as i'm concerned i'm not impressed but then again i never expected anything less this movie was directed by the same person that directed batman and robin another movie that should only be viewed with a blindfold in for the verdict a out of
i grew up watching the original tv series in the sixties and one thing that i can tell you right away there is no comparison this film was totally ridiculous with a flying suit that was alive a martian that took different shapes special effects that looked like something that a little child would create in contrast in the original characters were developed and the viewers developed a feeling for tim and uncle martin the only highlight in this film yes actually there was one occurred when ray walston finally made an appearance at the end he wore dark glasses and made references to living on this planet for years as a sort of homage to the tv series but even the real uncle martin could not save this turkey
would expect a movie with a famous comedian in the lead role to be a funny movie this is not the case here i laughed out loud once throughout the whole movie and that wasn't even during the final comedy-scene one would also expect to be the funniest this is one you can watch when it comes to tv don't spend any other money renting it
this is some of the worst acting i have ever seen i love nadja but this is just absolute dreck aside from a few moments of interesting cinematography and music this film is just nonstop bad acting and dumb material jared harris is particularly bad but no one in this is remotely good the plot is a joke but not the haha kind i don't even know if you can forgive movies that are this bad please erase the last hour and a half of my life how did this director make nadja and another girl another planet
for those who are too young to know this or for those who have forgotten the disney company went almost down the tubes by the end of the people were not seeing their movies anymore and the company was not producing the usual wholesome least no what people expected a major problem the idiots running the disney movies during that decade would produce films with swear words including the name in vain if you can believe that interspersed in these family films in fact that happens twice here in the first minutes movie in addition to the language problems has a nasty tone to it too which made it unlikeable almost right from the beginning thankfully disney woke up and has produced a lot of great material since these decadent movies is disney just under another name
the documentary and we use that term loosely apparently summarizes that muslims are trying to violently take over the world then states that any muslim that doesn't admit this is either ignorant of their own faith or lying to your face also every person that is interviewed in the film has found a market for their ludicrous take on reality by selling claptrap to conservatives willing to let others do the thinking for them what the west needs to know is this is nothing more than propaganda aimed at mental midgets if you are looking for an actual documentary on islam and the current state of the middle-east i would look elsewhere try something that provides multiple points of view from qualified sources
having grown up in texas and less than miles from what used to be i can tell you that this movie is nauseating the majority of texans do not live like this movie indicates the plot is weak and the fake accents are amusing and it reinforces the stereotypical image that all texans are beer drinking honky-tonkin rednecks the horribly fake texas accents is what kills it for me true there is a certain texas twang to most texans accents but these people overdo it you can't get someone from new jersey and ohio to do texas accents it just doesn't work john travolta should have stuck to disco-dancing or the debra winger was more convincing as wonder girl than she is as a texan
the animation was good the imagery was good although not totally original however the story was too long way too confusing and over the top dramatic after about an hour i couldn't wait to get it over with with so many characters that have nothing to contribute and plot elements that either come from nowhere or go nowhere this movie really wasn't one movie at all and would have been better of as a short series or possibly two movies if you like this kind of typical story maybe you will like it but frankly i've been spoiled by much more creative stories that actually have some sort message to tell go rent a miyazaki film and watch it twice you'll get way more out of it
cabin fever is the first feature film directed by eli and randy pearlstein co wrote the script from a story by a zombie owes a lot to george romero and his earlier living dead to the original texas chainsaw massacrenot to mention sam evil is nothing original the story is not acting is about par with this just that the story have pretty much seen this movie before and better said having achieved commercial if not artistic success from this decided he was a director and came out with the abysmally much more fest should have quit while he was fever is not a good compared to hostel it is a work of hope somebody a this guy that film-making is the wrong career for cabin weak for not being as abysmal as hostel
bad acting bad lighting bad plot this had the quality of a porno movie i have seen more interesting home video of a boring wedding than this sucked big time don't waste your time or money on this crap amazing that they allow this kind of smut to even be released on video it should be a crime
obvious attack on microsoft made by people who don't appear to understand intellectual property or market economies liberal tim robbins plays a painfully obvious caricature of bill gates and is a cartoonish corporate villain ordering murders right and microsoft may engage in some anticompetitive activity at times unlikely they actually murder people therefore the film is over the top and ridiculous from the deeper point is apparently that major tech innovations should be free to the public and not subject to intellectual property laws however this ignores the fact that most major innovations would never have been developed if not for the market incentives rewards provided by intellectual one thing to be opposed to anti-competitive conduct common sense quite another to be opposed to market competition in the first place which is what the mantra belongs to mankind another example of hollywood being completely out of touch with reality
this movie deserves credit for its original approach it combines elements of theater film and epic storytelling unfortunately it falls flat on all levels the films biggest weakness is unwillingness to commit to anything it has camp moralistic and epic elements without ever committing to any of them as for the story itself chretien de troyes is spinning in his grave at this horrible adaptation which turns the lovable unbearably innocent percival into a most ungallant and rude likely two types of people will see this francophiles or arthuriophiles speaking as one of the latter i found the movie unwatchable and an incredibly shabby disrespectful treatment of a beautiful story
this is the least scary film i have ever seen how the blob manages to eat anyone is the biggest mystery of the film the blob moves so slowly that an in a zimmerframe could escape it the blob has a large slice of luck coming across a typical horror film woman who instead of running away stands still for half an hour so that she can be eaten if you havent seen this film i recommend you do its far too funny to be taken seriously
may i please have my back i would have rather watched electric power comes to north america again this is a movie with one voice the same voice which comes out of every characters mouth regardless of age or gender to listen to that voice again i would have to charge at least an hour and i don't take insurance it was eerie watching will ferrell morph into woody but i don't think imaginative casting is enough one should wait until they have a story before they bother making a movie unless just doing it for the money and if the case why not just reissue an all-rap version of up tiger lily
i can only believe that garson kanin must have been two people the one who wrote the brilliant a double life and the funny born yesterday and co-wrote such excellent screenplays as rib and pat and mike with his wife ruth gordon and then the one who wrote directed such tiresome sad drivel as bachelor mother some kind of a nut and this the cast tries but the script is so tired and clich√©d that even the efforts of the always wonderful brenda vaccaro are defeated the script sinks to nadir in the truly offensive sequence in which character tests character to make sure not gay an ugly sequence but sadly one which could easily play in a film today ethnic jokes are now totally verboten but fag jokes are still good clean family fun
the premise is spooky a woman gets pregnant when kissed by a stranger in a as soon as the movie begins a horrible opening scene establishes that this is a c type sci-fi tv movie a big star trek and a bit x-files but more than anything else the movie kicks into action everything is predictable and cliche it looked more like a parter in a bad sci-fi tv series no suspense and no thrills but not for a lack of trying just a lot of predictable dramatic conflicts between the main waste your time
the good news the is spectacularly well done and they don't go for the gotcha gimmicks the film is based on the true story of the high point in human history and even features one of the actual participants in that story buzz now the meat of the matter about flies for krissakes flies with big googy human eyes true but flies nonetheless remember when i likened the underworld movies to rats vs cockroaches that wasn't intended as praise and i never dreamed anyone would take it literally this got even less empathy going for it baby maggots ugh in one of those odd confluences of hollywood groupthink this flik was evidently on the drawing boards at the same time as space chimps also about critters in rent apollo and see a movie about the real space program
i thought this was a sequel of some sorts and it is meant to be to the original from but a sequel is not taking the original plot and destroying actually had very little expectations to this movie but i just wasted minutes of life no suspense i actually feel clairvoyant poor acting and so filled with technical errors so i as a computer geek just couldn't believe it they have tried to make it a mix between a generic war movie and hours but this is not even worthy of a low budget tv not see this movie this is a complete waste of time instead get the original the theme is still valid don't let to much power into a machine and the acting and plot is far more exiting and compelling
from the pen of richard condon manchurian candidate comes this muddled tale of political intrigue and assassination the story told in almost comic book fashion is difficult to swallow all-star cast considered this poor effort is not entirely the fault of the cast and crew the novel was replete with the same short-comings it seems as though at times the story is actually mocking the more sincere effort put forth in manchurian candidate a disappointment on all counts
the two things are are good about this film are two unknown daphne zuniga in her first appearance in a film young and supple with looks that still encompass her body today steals the very beginning which is all she is in and that is that she is obviously just starting out because her acting improved with her next the score by then known composer young is what keeps this stinker from getting a one i know one star more is not much but in this case it is a rest is just stupid senseless horror of a couple a college students who try to clean out a dorm that is due for being torn down getting offed one by one by an unsuspecting killer blah blah all know where this is the first eighteen minutes with daphne zuniga then turn it off
this is a piece of this looks worse than a made for movie and i shutter to think that a sequel was even concieved and the results war is prettier than this jean claude van shame has done it again and he wonders why his career is where it is now no script no story and no time should be wasted on this i mean that out of is too high way too high goldberg should be jackhammered for this van shame is no actor
what reviewers and left out is the best part only memorable scene of this otherwise dreadful movie there is a very good rape-in-the-shower scene committed by the bad guy gazzara look-alike on maria mentioned killed later through ineptitude perhaps rape is too strong a word prison mating ritual may be more appropriate the background behind this chance yet forced meeting is the mobster who is hiding ben gazzara introduces him to the girls hanging out at his pool the blonde disses him but our villain must be quite smitten by her because the courtship is on at that point his first move is to attempt drowning her until his mafia don benefactor tells him to knock it off kind of like the girl in high school you didn't like but still wanted to have carnal knowledge of anyway just say he catches up with her in the cabana later
how this film was made with so many big stars is beyond me this is a terrible clich√© ridden film with the worst acting any of these actors have ever done it really surprises me that so many of these a list stars would agree to this unfunny film even worse is the fact that is made almost million here in the states it does go to show however that big stars can pull in the bucks even if the film is terrible i felt sorry for everyone involved in this snore-fest billy crystal tried his best with the what he was given and the rest of the stars seemed to be walking through the motions whatever you do don't fall for the excellent cast because no one could have saved this
it makes the actors in hollyoaks look like the royal shakespeare company this movie is jaw dropping in how appalling it is turning the dvd player off was not a sufficient course of action i want to find the people responsible for this disaster and slap them around the face i will never get that time back never how is it possible to create such a banal boring and soulless film i could not think of a course of action that would relieve the tedium writing the required ten lines is incredibly difficult for such a disgraceful piece of cinema what more can you say than reiterate how truly awful the acting is please avoid
there is a really good movie lurking just beneath the surface of the layers upon layers of cheese that is the found this out when i watched this again this morning after neglecting it for years and years i remember hating it with a passion when it first came out but this time i found that the special effects are quite good the plot is just the neverending story with a creativity-endectomy but an okay little flick for anyone who just wants some really awesome eye-candy the animation is amazing and i especially liked how the animators let their characters look and act a bit more surrealistic than the norm i'm giving it a grade of three as i have given it a two for parody value if i had ever decided to watch this movie expecting it to absolutely blow my mind story-wise
if you like occasional nudity with junior high school level slap stick comedy then look no at about the halfway point the beautiful and erotic arielle dombasle starts disrobing at every opportunity that is the only thing that made this movie worth story is both lame and preposterous the humor is corny and character development is basically non-existent
this film is a travesty and isn't fit to keep company with the superior original the plot is an absolute mess and the film is way too long everytime they're struggling they desperately inject a sentimental reminder from the first girl is one of the top british films of all time this one is awful
of the earth go working of the earth wonderful bridge in the of the earth little red indians children in newcastle united of the earth etc this is so poor and you should know better timothy spall they can't have paid you that for jimmy nail well the kindest thing that can be said is that he is every bit as good an actor as he is a singer and writer come on jimmy the over crocodile shoes and spender were very funny unfortunately i don't think they were supposed to be with auf wiedersehen pet the opposite applies
i was really horrified by this eerie movie what an unusual dark atmosphere and such a creepy musical score really promising indeed after ten minutes you really start sweating and feeling uncomfortable for you start fearing the worst this movie has the atmosphere of a true nightmare and worse-it all comes out for one hour and a half i have been trying to fight complete boredom and falling asleep but the monstrous soundtrack kept me awake nuit noire is a truly horrifying picture for your eyes your ears your intelligence and most of all your wallet since the thought of spending precious money on a movie ticket for this cheap amateuristic homevideo is the biggest horror of all
this movie is just plain bad it isn't even worth watching to make fun of it the lunatic professor is just plain annoying even suspending disbelief to allow for invisibility i glady do for the sake of good bad movies and allowing for exceedingly stupid victims in a horror movie this movie asks for even more than that if you are looking for locker room shower scenes and random sexual encounters get a porn if you are looking for a good-bad movie get something else if you want to simply waste your time on an annoying bad movie rent this
my spouse i found this movie to be very schlocky it started out good but quickly got unbelievable ridiculous most of the acting was poor with the exception of the little girl abbie who really was terrific in addition the dialog was predictable lame especially gideon the also without giving away anything when one of the characters has a tragedy she almost appears nonchalant at first we thought it was shock but then we realized that it was just a terrible script we love almost all of the hallmark movies their heart-warming stories but this movie doesn't rise to the occasion of being one there are so many great ones don't waste your time with this horrible movie
watching this movie made me think constantly why are they making such a problem out of some broken brakes there are a million options to slow down the car in the movie speed the writers a least thought of a good reason why the car wasn't able to aren't many good things to say about this film all the usual narrative make their appearance the actors are very bad the story is as leak as a sieve etc that makes this movie a waste of time and
what a all the bits of nostalgia that hollywood has decided to remake and update this is by far one of the most pointless this was a totally pointless show in the first place and we really don't need a modern mind the bigotry and sexism inherent in the system from the beginning so many advances have been made socially since the show ran that the entire point of the show it ever had one has been what is the point of having a character named boss hogg if not overweight
be warned neither zeta-jones nor mcgregor plays the main part as the poster would have you believe their roles are in fact film stumbles badly between exaggerated comedy and realistic drama with neither being really engaging especially i find it impossible to muster much sympathy for the main protagonist not to mention his screwball friends and sex obsessed fianc√© the plot drags terribly and i turned this one off after about unusual for me as i like to finish what i start the good acting and beautiful setting takes it from to
from the blocky digitised footage to the acting that makes keanu i'm so wooden i could be a plank me reeves look like an oscar winner this film bites not intended the best thing about it is the box of eraticate in the segment out of the three seemed to be the strongest piece in terms of storyline and twist wish i'd spent the it cost me on something else like erm natural born killers directors cut if you do buy this you're really in for a disappointment do yourself a favour and avoid it like the plague if you're looking for something amateurish and with actors that are more wooden than a then go ahead however if you want some quality werewolf action look elsewhere like dog soldiers wolfen werewolf hunt
i simply give this a three because it fulfilled what my buddies and i hoped it would do entertain wasn't stupid enough to rent this thinking it would be a zombie film up there with the likes of romero or fulci but what i rented it for was a laugh you are looking for a film for amusement or a film to make you shake your head in embarrassment go for it this is perfect for mystery science theater fans but the only downside is that it is so bad it makes fun of itself personally think it is a shame to relate this to any other hollywood title that we may know because when a film sucks like this it has its own genre
another rape of movie is a catastrophe it just uses a historic story and makes a sweet love story with bad acting and low budget movie should be the time they just dragged the time to make a mini battle scenes are so stupid and illogical the solders log stupid the costumes a catastrophe the romans were good in fighting in opened areas one of their armies was completely destroyed by the germans when they tried to fight in a forest in this movie the romans choose to fight in side the city i mean get by the way cleopatra was from a macedonian origin which means a light skinned person
there are some things i can never understand such as this movie what if i were to create a really really cheap and crappy looking dino and crocodile polygon model in maya and then proceed to cut and paste that into an amateur video clip having people scream and getting eaten by the same thing how can anyone even believe that an utterly fake cgi dinocroc that looks completely out of place would influence the events in this movie i know that its b-grade low budget and all but the producers could do better than making a piece of crap that no one will ever seen see or sit through it just does'nt make sense are people really so stupid that they would sit through this apparently so for laughs no this thing isn't even worth laughing at
the plot of the thinner is decidedly thin and gross an obese lawyer drives over the gypsy woman and the gypsy curse causes him to lose and lose weight to the bone ok gypsy curses should be entertaining but the weight-losing gone bad nope except stephen king thinks so and michael mcdowell other horror author and the screenwriter of this abysmal film does so too the lawyer is not only criminally irresponsible he is fat too haha the thinner is like an immature piece of crap for a person who moans how has never seen anything so disgusting than fatness hey i can only say well look at the mirror
unless the title is supposed to be some kind of spoiler for the transformation fiends ruining it for us anycase if this movie wasn't made-for-tv it should have been so remarkably low-budget underscripted underacted and hits every cliche except disco nobody is likeable and you could careless what happens to anyone in this one eminently forgetable except for the bad bad performances
this was an absolutely terrible movie don't be lured in by christopher walken or michael ironside both are great actors but this must simply be their worst role in history even their great acting could not redeem this ridiculous storyline this movie is an early nineties us propaganda piece the most pathetic scenes were those when the columbian rebels were making their cases for revolutions maria conchita alonso appeared phony and her pseudo-love affair with walken was nothing but a pathetic emotional plug in a movie that was devoid of any real meaning i am disappointed that there are movies like this ruining like christopher good name i could barely sit through it
never see this tries to be a spoof on films of the and but all it succedes at is making you wish really badly that you were watching one of them and not is very lame a spoof has to have some aspect which has some above par quality to it this movie does not have any such yourself too late for me but just don't watch it
one of the lamer wedding movies you'll see smacks too too much of its time period so it was out of date before it hit the theaters the ethnic stereotypes are like a henny youngman joke except they just aint in the least bit funny here molly ringwald well what else needs to be said give you a clue to the silliness she destroys a wedding dress because it just won't be me makes it into this rag with straps and puts on a top hat and everyone smiles cutely at her moxy rather than ringwalding her neck its a helluva a cast too check out how heavy ally sheedy is wheeeew
personally i think this show looks pretty cheaply made some of the actors are terrible they over do it seem fake i can always tell how going to end within the first minutes or less of watching because they make it so transparently clear not very well written either i love to watch it to laugh at it you know the saying so bad that good well that saying applies to this show i also like to watch just to see if i'm right when i guess how all going to end so far i've been right every time like a little game that i play nice when you are bored you feel like laughing at something
i went to a screening of this movie and while it had a couple moments that made me laugh it had some very major flaws it first of all presents itself to be the humorous exploits of a real-life divorcee trying to find love in la what it morphs into is a depressing narcissistic and unfunny romp through the history of the film love life and professional life jokes wear thin quickly and you find yourself suddenly not caring how this dates progress the ridiculousness is that the director simultaneously presents himself as an extremely annoying and heavily flawed character and then expects us to be concerned
i'm easily entertained i enjoyed hot shots and the naked gun and their many sequels even when most people found them unbearable i've even managed to enjoy most pauly shore movies there is only one movie that i've seen that i can honestly say was this was it been a while since i've seen it but i do remember sitting in the theater thinking this is a dumb movie why did i see this honestly the only movie that i cannot recommend
problem child is one of the worst movies i have seen in the last decade this is a bad movie about a savage boy adopted by two parents but he gets into trouble later that junior can drive car he can scare people with a bear he can put a room on fire it is a bad movie as much as battlefield earth a sequel is an even worse fate rent chicken run out of i give it
this film story is bad enough which can happen in real life i'm very can not understand when they show us this bad film i say it was bad because there is some reason if madonna was rich and can do everything she want then why she falling in love with that bad man how can the story script is so weak she was so rich can do everything she want but not dare to divorce her husband that is very words i love you it doesn't meant anything in this film
i'm not a huge freddy krueger that doesn't mean that i don't like robert englund and his other nightmare on elm street think that robert is a very good plays a better freddy krueger than he offense robert this movie acting is plot is really freddy krueger is the only part of the cast even worth sequels can be better than the as the friday the thought the remake was the best in the this isn't one of those original was in my opinion was was okay but i seen the you make the same mistake i did by watching this piece of crap
horrible people ought to be the subtitle of this horrible film if you want to see ordinary people doing ordinary things then look out of your window at real life but if you want to see unpleasant people doing dull things you'll have to watch this horrible film by mike leigh the characters talk at length but never actually manage to communicate with each other why not presumably because leigh things that all of us are as ineffective and pathetic as his actors and he wants to film real life but we're not and he failed
i have never seen a movie as bad as this it is meant to be a fun movie but the only joke is at the start and it is not funny if you like this sort of movie then you may just be able to give it a vote of if it had the necessary votes it would truly belong on the bottom
hm while an enjoyable movie to poke plot holes point out atrocious acting primitive best special effects of which have caused me to view this movie three times over the past six years severed ranks among the worst i've ever seen i'm never sure who the protagonists are all i know is that the killer uses a portable guillotine as seen in the dance floor murder scene all in all i don't really like the movie because only the first minutes are enjoyable the rest is a mishmash of confusing dialog and imagery that fail to progress the story to a logical conclusion i can't remember anyway
redline is a knockoff of fast furious without any of the redeeming qualities it doesn't need to have a convoluted plot with multiple twists and surprises but it needs something this is the equivalent of a porn film where the storyline and dialogue consist of seconds at the beginning and the same at the end except that this is worse because you don't get your worth mind-numbingly boring impossible race sequences and a terrible waste of expensive beautiful cars which almost acquire negative points for having appeared in this movie sure hot but that desperate for an on screen female i feel like the director sat there with a hat full of dialogue and plot snippets and shook an ball every time they switched scenes no serious person who races or knows anything about it would watch this movie and enjoy the race scenes
thank it bombed or we might get treated to such delights as skate fu where we can see the likes of brian boitano performing a triple lutz slashing bad guys to ribbons with his razor-sharp skates but i digress one thing that could have helped this turkey would have been a little t a from ms agbayani not like the world would have seen anything new least that part of the world who saw her playboy spread i truly believe that porn would have suited her talents much better although aubrey hepburn couldn't have stayed afloat in this sewer one explanation for kurt thomas presence could be a traumatic brain injury possibly from coming up short too often on dismounts a good thing the ioc wasn't as diligent on doping as they are now or kurt would surely have been stripped of his medals to be avoided at all costs
having the in-laws over for the weekend then this is the film to hasten their departure failing that it will induce a catatonic state to bring a welcome relief from constant film is supposedly set on board a luxury cruise ship which is more superannuated car ferry the plot has more holes than the average colander and a cast dredged from the depths of the celebrity d list an interesting piece of added amusement is playing spot the villain as passengers join the ship you won't be wrong with a script that sinks faster than a brick clich√©d set pieces and copious amounts of raspberry jam doubling as blood this film attempts to encompass the genres of thriller action movie and gore-fest and simultaneously fails to fulfil any of must watch film if only to laugh at how bad it is
a really bad sequel part had a lot of funny moments part is just bad a boring way and obviously made to squeeze money out of the on you otto only slightly amusing moment in the film is helge schneider who apparently seems to be about the other characters quite easy to identify with screenplay is the director should do everyone a favor and quit his job immediately the acting is worse than a grade school play the movie is awful as well but who can blame the guys who had to work with such an untalented director
it was disgusting and painful what a waste of a cast i swear the audience full laughed twice in minutes this is not a lie do not even rent jones was just too mean to be was ok just ok i felt sorry for him actor in case people remember this was the same as she always is charming and sweet but with no purpose the romance with john was completely unbelievable
this might be unbelievable but this movie has grossed in russia shown in almost all cinema theaters and still running well i have no idea why distributors put their eye on this particular uh movie which had almost no screening around the world some kind of enigma haha maybe it was based on the fact that another movie pledge this with paris hilton which was as well released only dvd almost everywhere had major screenings in russia and grossed more than besides both movies had a lot of promotion like there were the banners all over the city tv commercials and etc speaking about movie i'd say dull and absolutely boring it could be better really even if it has jessica simpson
i grew up watching and loving the thunderbirds all my mates at school watched we played thunderbirds before school during lunch and after school we all wanted to be virgil or scott no one wanted to be alan counting down from became an art form i took my children to see the movie hoping they would get a glimpse of what i loved as a child how bitterly disappointing the only high point was the snappy theme tune not that it could compare with the original score of the thunderbirds thankfully early saturday mornings one television channel still plays reruns of the series gerry anderson and his wife created jonatha frakes should hand in his directors chair his version was completely hopeless a waste of film utter rubbish a cgi remake may be acceptable but replacing marionettes with homo sapiens subsp sapiens was a huge error of judgment
its one of those stereotypical mtv generation dance movies and i do not see where all this its not that bad rubbish is coming from the acting is terrible it follows exactly the same storyline as all the other dancing movies out there its terrible the name should scream don't watch how she move since when can movie titles ignore grammar at least some dance movies had half decent dance scenes these ones don't even deserve a watch i give it a out of just because there is no zero i seriously implore anyone with an iq of over not to watch this and not to waste your money the should tell it all this movie should not have even be made
this is absolutely the worst movie i've seen all i will say that the acting was very good and by all of the was apparently meant to be very offbeat and in that regard it succeeded by the same token the story revolves around a self-centered wannabe who is a clueless talentless chronic liar whose source of self confidence comes from a pair of leather was worse than watching a car wreck
three daring daughters is a sickly sweet rose-colored look at divorce remarriage and single-parent living obviously social issues and economic difficulty have no place in the picture perfect life of a single parent mother who feels exhausted takes a cruise and then dates and marries a band conductor even when the its just a movie phrase excuses the script from addressing real-life problems daughters suffers from too many incoherent high-note songs children whose personalities are not based on real children and band leader hose iturbi playing himself isn't it bizarre that any real person would star in a film in which their supposed real self gets married this movie was released in the nineteen forties only a love for old style hollywood romance and comedy could make daughters a tolerable film
i rented this movie tonight because it looked like a fun movie i figured that you really couldn't go wrong with a concept of ex girlfriend with super powers but the movie was confused and pointless seemed that at every turn the writer kept throwing junk in also the writer kept throwing in way too much toilet humor and sexual situations that only a teenage boy could seems that it could have been so simple to draw a story out of fatal attraction super hero but i guess not is not a fun romantic comedy it was advertised to be you could not take a child to see it and you would be embarrassed seeing it a date the writer could have done a basic story around the high concept and cleaned it up the movie might have a fighting chance serious waste of
this may be one of the worst movies to ever make it to production the most exciting part is the beginning where the guy is walking and walking and walking there is about minutes of just walking how not to mention a lot of issues with the lighting and almost like they even shot the night scenes during the day the acting was terrible it looks like they found a community theater mexico and then took the people who were turned for the love of everything holy don't rent this movie if you know someone who owns it apologize to them the director should be subject to punishment through the war crimes tribunal for foisting this on the public
a found tape about guys having fun torturing a woman in several inhuman of all the acting made this short not scary at all the woman seemed to have orgasms not suffering some of the punishments were so ridiculous shocking about throwing some meat or spin her in a chair if you are shooting a nonsense tape at least make it good the only part to remark is the end the hammered hand and the pierced eye the rest of the film is really poor to end the boredom the supposed story about the tape being investigated extra bullshit
i was very excited about seeing this film anticipating a visual excursus on the relation of artistic beauty and nature containing the kinds of wisdom the likes of rivers and tides however not what i received instead i get a fairly uninspired film about how human industry is bad for nature which is clearly a quite unorthodox photographer seems conflicted about the aesthetic qualities of his images and the supposed ethical duty he has to the workers occasionally peopling the images along the periphery and frankly the images were not generally that impressive and according to this artist scale is the basis for what makes something all respects a stupid film for people who'd like to feel better about their environmental consciousness but not for any one who would like to think about the complexities of the issues surrounding it
if i could give it a zero i'd change my mind and give it a instead absolutely horrible movie with no movie plot doesn't make sense of what is happening just plain boring please don't waste your money on this one pleaseee this movie could have done so well if it truly depicted the real zodiac story but nopes i didn't feel anything but disgust while watching it do yourself a favor and rent some classic movies instead its better to watch a movie you've already seen like times than watch this crap i don't understand why people even bother to make such movies when they know its not going to do well zodiac killer should be called boriac killer instead
may contain campy bad special effects it has a tv-movie feeling to it the idea of the un as being taken over by satan is an interesting twist to the end of the world according to the bible the premise is interesting but its excution falls waaaay short if you want to convert people to christianity with a film like this at least make it a quality one i was seriously checking my watch while watching this piece of dreck can't say much else about this film since i saw it over a year ago and there isn't really much to say about this film other it
after the opening credits a black screen for about a minute a minute of nothing then a girl wakes up and takes a her and two college friends are driving to a rock concert after much padding they hit something and skid off the road they awaken in a cabin inhabited by a wheelchair-bound old lady and her killings are sadly very tame for a supposed video nasty the twist ending silly and predictable no one involved in the mess would ever make anything of note again so there are still happy endings candy sara ansley gets topless and laurel munson has full frontal on display grade d
the case is the best part of the movie but it alone is not worth the purchase price i expected a based on the true story movie only to find a shot on home video hodge-podge of poorly shot clips tied together with pathetic acting and non-related slaughter house scenes the video scenes had numerous rewind situations which were used probably to extend the length of the feature rather than for effects i started this review before i was even halfway through the movie and waited till it was over just in case it had a better ending but low and behold it only got worse if i could mark it any lower it would have been a negative ten learn from my mistake and save your money and time with this one
my guess is that this had something to say see what it could have been a frog storms would be creepy b can i get someone like tom cruise to say the c word many times and look like a bad patrick rafter c cast my wife and get her to say the f word every seconds this aside i really liked the beginning and the frog storm the rest was a relentless over-long over-indulgent failure glad so many of you enjoyed it
shame shame shame on for what you do was appalled not take kids to see this movie the humor is totally inappropriate for children plus they'll be bored and disappointed certainly have read wonderful children book and certainly we have this is pure trash dr seuss would be ashamed and certainly would've never given his thumbs up at such a dastardly attempt to capitalize on a a pity your money on the book if you own a copy then buy the book and donate it to a toys for tots program this movie is not worth a free ticket with the book the tv cartoon version works well if you want a visual portrayal save your save your money it will be on cable by saint shame shame on what they do
saw in on tv late last night yeah i can hear what y'all say about this one it is likely to be categorized as one of those typical tv soap series in all fairness the story line does have a fine twist to it and you might nod saying well not what i expected but as a film well it is not easy to spot a redeeming element casting acting camera work cars costume setting script no nothing to congratulate rated r oh that scene did we need it this is a film that you can watch it and then forget that you even watched and what was the title again
darkly comic serendipity about a cosmetics saleswoman with odd ties to elvis presley running into a sea of elvis impersonators while speaking at conventions in accidentally killing each one of them through little fault of her own kim basinger a still-attractive actress of considerable merit likes to pick quirky movies to play in but this dreadful screenplay mitchell ganem and adam-michael garber hasn't an iota of good humor the stereotypes and low-ball gags are not meant to be the stuff of classic comedy but even on a shambling shameful level the picture is crude and sloppy if you do watch see if you can count how much extraneous shots there are of basinger behind the wheel of her pink cadillac hands always in the same position and a non-plussed look on her face hopefully both she and elvis were well paid no stars from
it is very unfortunate when a movie such as this is made a great deal of work and money has been put into a film that is amateur at editing drags on there are obvious mistakes that could have been corrected easily in a second take and the soundtrack is unimaginative so much more could have been done with this video movie i guess they ran out of time or shots have a distinct amateur feel to them
the guy did a lot of title design for a bunch of movies and i guess one day he said i should pick a cheap scenario try to put as much title in it as a can cause after all i'm a title designer and try to persuade people that this is in fact a movie one of the worst i've even seen for sure if you fell the urge to see nice titles go check out some posters don't waste your time watching kinda ironic don't you think did you saw the poster the only part of his project that should had title work done have almost none
why is it that any film about cleopatra the last phaoroh brings out the worst in movie making whatever attraction the woman had for the greatest roman of them all julius ceasar and his successor mark anthony never seems to come across on the screen as other than the antics of over sexed high school seniors despite lavish sets and costumes this movie is as bad as any italian sandals and toga extravaganza of the admittedly this kind of spectacular belongs on the big screen which is why gladiator went over well but gladiator did not have all the romance novel varela has as little acting talent as elizabeth taylor but timothy dalton has talent to spare pity some of it didn't wash off on the others
i was lucky enough to see a chorus line when it came to my city i was younger then but it was an excellent play so would someone please tell me why in heavens name did they have to make a movie out of it and why michael douglas he didnt suit the role this movie really sucked big time advise is not to rent this movie save your money for something better like cats
needless remake and it can't come close to capturing the charm of the original the extreme length causes more than a few yawn inducing parts this version is ridiculously politically correct the film lacks style and mostly it lacks talent not just with the acting but the direction sets costumes etc are all below par it has a blatant disregard for period detail vanessa williams is the only cast member that shows any flair tyne daly isn't too bad they should have left well enough alone the singing ranges good williams to poor else watch the original version and skip this one there is not much here to recommend
i can't believe this movie managed to get such a relatively high rating of it is barely watchable and unbelievably boring certainly one of the worst films i have seen in a long long a no-budget way it reminded me of star wars episodes i and ii for the sheer impression that you are watching a total creative train film should be avoided at all costs one of those festival films that only please the pseudo-intellectuals because they are so badly made those people think it makes it different therefore film-making is not different just bad film-making
i thought i'd be locked away in a padded cell and they'd throw away the key is a paraphrased snatch of dialogue from state of wonders in what tangled forest paula milne and her co-writer found the magic mushrooms they must have eaten to create this feeble whodunnit and bring such rubbish to our screens a padded cell should indeed be left cusack did her best did the other actors but surely her talent deserves a better vehicle than this the height of absurdity has been reached and this particular state of mind is best buried and forgotten and certainly not just placed in a box and locked away in a drawer
i'm not sure what i just couldn't laugh at it i had an open mind i didn't want to be a about it but i seriously just couldn't laugh at this film it was just not funny to me some parts it seemed like ben stiller and jack black tried too hard just because you put two very funny men together doesn't mean that this is going to be an excellent comedy some movies just shouldn't be made this is one of them because it does a lot of old jokes and the acting was just stupid i know i know a comedy sort of at least but i was just not impressed i'm sorry but i cannot give this anything lower than a two and all i'm giving
from this awful movie there are so many things wrong with this film acting writing direction editing etc that amazing that something rises to the top and proves itself to be the absolute worst the music i noted that the film has two composers listed this must be the reason why every single frame has music of the absolute worst d movie style drivel they have never heard of the expression less is more it got so painful to listen to i muted the sound every time there was no dialogue not that the dialogue was that good you have to feel sorry for robert wagner and tom bosley i'm sure they didn't see roles like this in the twilight of their careers see it at your own risk
sucks all i got to say about this sorry excuse for a film sucks sucks sucks i mean what the hell were they thinking the idiots involved should never be allowed to make another films the acting was so bad that it even failed to entertain on a bad level the attempt at a lesbian scene was sad i felt so bad for the ladies involved this movie sucks sucks heard rumors of a
telling that as of the entry of this comment no females have submitted a vote of any kind for this movie not surprisingly cheesy science fiction doesn't appeal to them quite as much if you like a good b movie and especially if you like to satirize them as you watch you will like this if you don't have fun watching bad movies this not for you
this show is painful to watch is obvious that the creators had no clue what to do with this show from the ever changing jobs boyfriends and cast it appears that they wanted to cast amanda bynes in something but had no idea what and came up with this crappy show they cast her as a teen surrounded by twenty and thirty somethings and put her in mostly adult situations at repeatedly failed attempts at comedy soon they realize that she needs a clique and cast people in their late to try to pass as this show survived seasons is beyond me somehow abc has now decided that it is a family show and thrown it into afternoon lineup on abc family
caught this movie on the tube on a sunday i thought it was so bad i looked it up on imdb to see what others thought of it i was not surprised at the amount of silly people who enjoyed this fluff i was however surprised when i looked into the comments to read the hated it categories only to find that their were none i was shocked at this i always look at the hated as their are always those who hate a movie no matter how good it is somehow this movie made it through unscathed by the haters i say nay to that and proclaim proudly that i hate this movie i know i should go into detail about why i hate this movie but to do so would only grant this movie more respect than it deserves
i'm glad that i saw this film after became is there is no plot like watching a painfully dull home really enjoy his other if you're a fan like away from this one it may change your thoughts on adam you may never recover from the horror that is this had a better time watching old folks play scrabble in a home
if you enjoy seeing what must have started as a hour movie in unconnected bursts of unwatchability you'll love this film otherwise you'll just wonder how they could have made such a film from something so simple to translate to the big screen as inspector the previews for the film many scenes were shown which were not in the film and within the film some scenes just don't make sense while the movie is slightly less than hour and a half i can only think of one truly memorable moment and that is just before or during the
at the end of this episode holmes asks watson not to record the case for a good reason the super sleuth left his little grey home for this tale there is no deductive acute analysis of signs at crime scenes holmes bumbles along fifty yards behind the plot the dastardly cam is finally dealt to by an old frail-in a manner that would have made charles heart swell with pride-six bullets in the an ensuing chase a pursuer gets hold of one of the writer didn't decide to tack on the story of cinderella to lengthen the and scot free oh is a bit of a change of pace in late victorian bit of sixgun
bad actors terrible script totally unbelievable ending this film had it all after seeing films like this you wonder why the makers bothered at all this film has absolutely nothing to say all the methods used to create a scare have been used over and over again in previous horror films a total waste of time
i read the reviews before i watched this movie and i didn't believe them i love crap movies and i expected this one to be average it wasn't this film makes camp blood and look like greats the film contains bad acting poor sound poor confusing storyline bad and it bored me so much i turned it off even the nudity was rubbish did they even have a budget for this film i don't think they did you can tell if your gonna like this film or not in the first minutes if u want a good cheesy gory film go watch toxic avenger or even camp blood avoid this trash i watched it on tv and felt riped off so don't spend anything on it the best part is probably the end
this movie is about a cop wan lau trying to catch a super-clever thief cheng who blackmails an insurance company headed by a kelly lin basically whatever plans the cop tries the thief somehow knows them beforehand this movie covered by handsome lead actors beautiful lead actress and good camera shots of hong kong scenes really has no substance at all all flash and the flash quickly becomes dull too i lost all interests a third of the way into the movie and there is no redeeming quality after that except for the cinematography which looks good only consider seeing this movie if you can do so for free also consider stopping watching the movie minutes into the movie because all the same to the end boring
ok i adore this will credit this movie alone for making me such a die-hard horror fanatic i could never watch this movie alone i've also heard many many stories of the effect it had in original release at the theatres on its viewers incredible masterpiece horrible psychological stuff scares the pants off me oh bless their hearts whoever made this awesome film i love it i thought the whole film was decent and interesting this movie is so scary this is the scariest movie i have ever seen in my life not that what happens in the film and the idea of the film are not scary enough but what always got me was fabulous acting best horror film ever nothing can ever be this scary again halloween viewing at its evilest
this is the worst ripoff of home alone movies that i have ever seen watch part and two but don't let anyone say that this is better than the first two i mean really you don't make a movie then make a sequel with the same characters and actors and then make another sequel with different characters and actors i mean it would have been ok if this wan't a home alone movie but they did make it a home alone movie culkin is too old now so you're suppose to stop making sequels goodness this movie makes me sick buy part and
this was an impulse pick up for me from the local video store don't make the same mistake i did this movie is tedious unconvincingly acted and generally boring the dialogue between the young priest and his uncle is particularly poorly written and delivered i cringed at every scene they shared dennis hopper makes a few sparse appearances and is his usual disjointed self his role was clearly not a stretch for him and although the movie is supposedly set in puerto rico it feels a lot more like a hollywood movie lot all of the main characters are caucasian and several tend to speak english with pseudo-irish accents odd anyway when you see this one on the shelf of your local video store keep walking
this movie had some andrenaline kickers but an old story that simply could never happen navy protocols could never break down that much that a crew much less an xo could ever go that far against the captain i'll take dr strangelove any day if i wish to see this plot us navy did not support this film
wow a movie about nyc politics seemingly written by someone who has never set foot in nyc you know a problem when at one moment you expect the credits to roll and the movie continues on for another half hour the characters are boring john accent is laughable and the plotline teeters between boring and laughable a horrible movie
nothing quite like watching giant robots doing battle over a desert wasteland and robot wars does deliver sure the acting is lousy the dialogue is sub-par and the characters are one-dimensional but it has giant robots the special effects themselves are actually quite good for the period they are certainly not as polished as standards but it contains a minimum of computer graphics and instead uses miniatures so it has aged fairly well its shortcomings are easily overlooked given the films short runtime and it does have a certain tongue-in-cheek humour in parts that make it quite enjoyable i would recommend this to any fan of giant robots or cheesy sci-fi who is looking for a lighthearted hour of distraction
this movie is hilarious not in good way the fights are awfully bad done while sometimes they will try to shock you by breaking some bones and even this happens only two or three times definitely not enough to call it a shockmovie a gunfight means a hero can walk into an open field with people shooting at him with pick up a gun start shooting back and not get hurt story empty guy waking up lost his memory starts fighting cos what good at five years later memories come back takes revenge blablabla worth your buck not really worth your time unless you're drunk and bored
the producers of this film offer to pay funeral expenses for anyone who dies of fright while watching this movie they should have offered intensive psychotherapy for anyone who really enjoyed this stinker a young couple moves into a house where a woman who looks like the woman from the couple lived extremely boring and very predictable in the end i ended up not caring about anyone in this this one at all costs
this film was more effective in persuading me of a zionist conspiracy than a muslim one and i'm go to journalism school read an editorial freshman year rhetoric these alarmist assertions presented in a palatable way might prove persuasive but by offering no acknowledgment of possible opposing arguments nor viable any at all solutions few sources and each of dubious origin makes the argument an ineffectual thank goodness for that i wouldn't want anyone to leave the theatre believing any of this racist good lesson for me and hopefully a cautionary tale for you to actually read about a film before seeing it
this is waaaaay to much so frustrating to watch i was waiting for the whole damn movie to end and to finally get some answers and what i've had in the end was nothing but a huuuge neon-sign question mark above my head i haven't seen such a bad acting and such a nonsense movie in a long long time and bothering me is how come someone actor read the script of such a movie and say ok i'm in film this this is horrible this movie suuuuuuuuuuuucks i just can't believe i've spent an hour and a half of my life on something like this
one of if not the worst film to come out of britain in the tawdry tale of a middle aged lecher who seduces two teenage scrubbers who babysit for him and his faux-posh wife has nothing to redeem turns gratuitous puerile uncouth and unrealistic this film plumbs the depths as it fails miserably in its attempts to be funny provocative intellectual and controversial the worst thing about this film is the way the strong cast of george costigan michelle holmes and siobhan finneran are completely stitched by such a lame script no surprise that this was the late andrea only work to make it onto the screen complete and utter rubbish on every level
i cannot believe the same guy directed this crap and dracula dracula was innovative fresh and well written if poorly pile can't even claim that it starts with the defeat of dracula at the end of dracula then ignores the narrative afterwards describing what happened after that following the narrative properly could have made this a good sequel somehow but craven chose to go in the style of his older films having no good tie but the main the actor playing dracula was different from dark hair in dracula to a blonde this movie if you have any respect for your taste in movies
i completely agree with the other comment someone should do a up tiger lily with this has to be one of the worst french films i've seen in a long time along with brotherwood of the wolves horrendous films in a much too short period of really sad because the cast is really interesting and the original idea kind of fun antoine decaunes in particular and jean rochefort being among my darlings i was bitterly disappointed to see them compromised in such a poor doyon is quite bad as usual which goes to prove that a pretty face and famous parents can get you into the movies but they don't necessarily give you this film if you want to laugh watch an alain chabat instead or some nice period piece full of fun like la fille de d'artagnan
without a doubt one of the worst movies i've seen in recent years the story focuses on four women driven to robbing banks who we are somehow supposed to sympathize with tough to sympathize with characters who keep making such stupid decisions oh no the cops are on to us they know who we are what do we rob one more bank then we're outta here what every character is a stereotype and easy to tell gonna end up dead
except for the better than average acting skills of the two leads this movie is really really bad the cheap production values don't help of course you wouldn't really notice that the production values are cheap if they didn't keep trying to convince you they had a production values to begin with even for a b-movie genre freak like myself this movie really sucks
after the atomic bombs carried by a shot-down soviet bomber explode in the arctic the creature gammera is released from his hibernation the giant prehistoric turtle proceeds on a path to tokyo and destroys anything in his path the military and the scientific community rush to find a means to stop this monster before tokyo is laid to waste according to the dvd synopsis re-produced for american audiences version of this the first film in the gamera series adds english language material that is even funnier than the regularly dubbed japanese fare clearly the monster is following in the footsteps of godzilla taking his cue from faddish batman tv series musician wes ludicrous theme song heightens the us camp gammera the invincible sandy howard noriaki yuasa dick o'neill brian donlevy albert dekker john baragrey
a disappointing story established our protagonist as chrissy a young rather sullen individual drifting not doing much actually she does very little to move the narrative along so it didn't surprise me to see the focus shifting on her relatives a pity though chrissy seem like interesting was predictable and at times felt quite formulated so the question now is when are we going to see the campions jacksons and the breaking ground with compelling cinematically-told stories that will inspire rather than entertain for the toll of two a disgusting shot film
one night i was waiting for my friends to come back to the apt and gymkata happened to be on i watched way too much of it it is indeed hilarious and horrifying really think about it this in your job you had an idea for something this bad and went on to execute it in as terrible a fashion as this how long exactly would you last not as long as this movie a must-see obviously
but there are not too many of them probably the worst major release film i have seen in my life definitely the worst for this year there is no point in commenting on the plot the cast or the acting the problem is beyond all that it lays in the absolute stupidity of the annoying kind the funny kind of everything that takes place on the screen i don't know why i gave it a instead of probably because of steven martini he really did try bottom line minutes washed down the toilet along with a few brain cells avoid at any cost
this movie is awful i don't even know where to begin i'm speechless i can't even describe how awful this is the blood is flourescent first of all and the acting is awful the only good part was the biker chick that saves the day this movie was rediculous i don't see how it could even get a vote of its so bad it looks like it was made by highschool students
this must be one of the worst movies i've ever seen the graphics are ridiculous and the script pathetic and the biggest question is how this rather low brow script got trough the selection like all sorts of movies from deep dramas to the more male oriented kill everything you see type of movie so i can't say i'm picky i have been struggling to find something to compare it to but i just can't think of anything that matches this maybe starship troopers witch in my opinion makes the movie gods cry and me thinking about throwing out my dvd player but compared to this its effects are great the acting superb and the script should be awarded you know when a movie is bad in a funny way well folks this isn't one of those this kills your soul minute by minute
oh dear what a horrid production was so cheap and nasty remember the shot from the natural where the lightning hits the tree a glowing stump that roy hobbs makes a bat from well the producers of this movie used that same scene to prefix a scene where a tree branch slammed into the wonder if they paid to use the footage from the natural or did they just hope that no-one who would watch the film would pick it up at the end where they were getting trying to get away in the truck such over-acting in the cabin really bad film a really bad film
wendy wu homecoming warrior has a very good strong plot but is ruined by cheesy details throughout the movie i am a younger teenager and didn't enjoy this movie very much i thought the effects were horrible but they might seem entertaining to younger children the matrix moves ruined the action you know that it was absolutely fake then there was the yen lo an evil spirit who temporarily possesses random people and homecoming in which wendy was striving to win it all ends like a typical feel good movie when wendy and her buddhist monk cousin shen defeat yen lo destroy him forever in the end so wendy learns a blah blah i'm ready for the next dcom
this movie is one reason imdb should allow a vote of the acting is awful even what some here have lauded the carpathia character the script looks like it was written in haste in one scene the black preacher who was left behind when asked by buck what in the computer graphic meant said daniel he probably meant verse but the film makers missed this slip up perhaps the worst part is that the eschatological position is biblically unsound while many christians have espoused the interpretation of end-time events such interpretation in is faulty to understand these flaws read christians will go through the tribulation by jim mckeever and the blessed hope a biblical study of the second advent and the rapture by george e ladd
happened upon a copy of this not mine and if i had spent my own money on this i'd be finding those responsible and demanding it back all i can say is this would be a terrible student film any understanding of the medium of film is absent acting is god awful the story would have been rejected from the original twilight zone series as unoriginal and lame and the change in tone of the lead reaction to the ghost is can only agree that the glowing reviews of this film are from friends and family i'm afraid not even entertainingly in the extreme avoid avoid
this book-based movie is truly awful and a big disappointment we've been waiting for this move over a month many film reviewer were hopeful for it also in newspapers and tv it made big sense when april comes many people regretfully noticed that movie is really awful why first of all story was so monotone it has been many indefinite scenes sometimes hard to realize going on the actresses out of hulya avsar weren't harmonized with their roles especially vildan atasever she acts better in comedy films in this movie a kind of drama she couldn't disposed of her previous role and finally movie is too short just minutes
the previous poster obviously worked on the movie a joke how bad it is and no one would review this kind of movie the way he all of the actors names and what they were in previously is a sure sign that involved with it in some on cinemax right now and i was sure this was some movie where porn stars one called ava is gorgeous and well-endowed were forced to make something else for some crazy tax when i first saw it i was sure it was made in about and i was born in so i thought i knew what i was talking was made in i would call it one of those so bad good movies like watching a train wreck
lame cliched superhero action movie drivel i had high hopes for this movie and the genre of hk buddy cop actioneers is one that i don't despise but very rarely do i see a storyline as trite and ludicrous as this one was this would have been forgivable as it always is in these kinds of movies when the action compensates unfortunately it did not the action does carry the trademark surreality and over the top nature of hk action but not very involving obscenely gory and in fact often completely incoherent this is due to re-editing for american release it does show signs in many places of patchwork i was very disappointed
twin brothers separated at birth to the deaths of their parents reunite twenty five years later to avenge their parents and take back their million dollar tunnel double impact runs at two hours long and basically adds no real approach to the corsican brothers plot and jean-claude van damme while adequate as the evil twin brother is just embarrassing as the good twin brother also the action sequences aren't as exciting this time and jean-claude relies more on gunfire then on his martial arts also the supporting cast is wasted and at two hours the movie is just plain out of
this is a made-for-tv and rather needless sci-fi channel retelling of the beowulf story especially after the recent film beowulf and grendel this movie doesn't really get into story but just takes us through his battle against the ravenous beast known as grendel as it leaves a kingdom in absolute fear and turmoil while the powerful viking warrior beowulf is called upon to rid them of the rampage if this is successfully accomplished the king will no longer have to sacrifice the children to keep it at bay after a few failed attempts the creature is slain but angry and vengeful mother soon attacks leaving it up to beowulf to again lend his mighty acts of bravery and strength to defeat it grendel looks like it was shot on a tiny budget and the cg effects are terrible like i said this movie is absolutely needless
this is a truly abysmal stock clone with a stellar cast and a terrible script i have no idea why so many top british actors signed up to this junk they must have been bribed a miss match of a storyline goes on forever and ever and ever and if i hadn't have paid good money for it i'd have turned it off after minutes not the worst film ive ever seen that honour goes to the truly pathetic used bogroll of a use the term loosely feel like suing that so called for the lost hour and a half of my life but this trash is nearly right down there with it definitely one of the worst films i have ever seen stuff like this reminds hollywood that they don't have a monopoly on truly awful films
this is just a joke of a lost me already at the opening scene dangerous creature kills other creature in his is watched by a scientist that works there on a monitor and guess what she lets go in to the cage to check the stuff how dumb do those writers think human beings are come on thats the same like jumping in a fish tank with a great white shark because it ate your useless and even more i will not even talk about the cast because they aren't worth the effort why they didn't fired the guy that wrote that immediately is a mystery to this kinda dumbness continues the entire movie only good thing where the cgi that is better then average for these kinda low-budget these kinda things don't bother you go see be warned if your iq is above you will probably hate it
this movie is terrible carlitos is a great film goodgfellas it isn't but its one of the better crime films done this movie should be considered closer to the sting or maybe speed zone remember those gems the only reason this movie was made was to capitalize on the cult following of the original this movie lacked everything de palma pacino and penn worked so hard on there wasn't a likable character and that is the fault of everyone responsible for making it i hope rise to power wins every razzie it possibly can and maybe even invent some new categories to allow it be a record holder after i watched this fest movie i sat down and watched the original carlitos way to get th bad taste out of my mouth after watching this i wish pachanga came and whacked me out of my misery
here we have misunderstood kids who never stood a chance against a cruel poverty riddled existence robin hoods singled out by the police for persecution because they were a trifle wild at times gad according to this crap bonnie was the sweetest little thing west of the missouri who was taught to be a psychopathic murderer by a fun loving boyfriend who didn't really want to hurt just wanted things without putting a lot of energy into getting them badly acted poorly filmed unbelievable dialogue unrealistic use of weaponry gore that looked more like grape jelly than the real thing avoid this bilgewater thumbs down stars
in sixth grade every teacher i had decided it would be a great idea to make this movie the curriculum for an entire semester every class had something to do with this terrible show we watched it in english and wrote in journals as if we were one of the characters in math we talked about charts and other sea crap in science we talked about whales was actually somewhat interesting so this wasn't a waste of time all day everyday was torture not only that but they would subject us to this horror twice a day by making us watch it in study hall as well i could see if this was a new series or something but it was like i'm still trying to block this out
just kidding this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen it was so bad though that it was hilarious my friend and i purposly rented it because it looked so bad cheesy old horror flicks are always good for some laughs the plot stunk some of the voices were dubbed the quality was horrendous but i sure had a blast watching it
if you want to watch a real quality movie get hold of the eden formula this wondrous film must have cost all of to make it features a wafer thin script pathetically bad sets lighting and camera work and a stop motion paper-mache monster that is utterly laughable looks like they sometimes used a guy in a rubber suit a glove puppet for the monster but all were equally dreadful actors all speak their lines as though they've never seen them before and are reading off a teleprompter the special effects are way beyond lousy and the only sad thing is that they dropped the really nifty original title tyranasaurus wrecks which sums up exactly what you get for the full is what happens when you scrape the bottom of the barrel so hard you break through to the crud that lies underneath loved every minute of it
what an absolute pile of pants having read chris books religiously since i came across quite ugly i was delighted to find out that this drama had been obviously had too much faith is probably the best thing in this show and even he doesn't quite fit how anyone can read the book and then adapt it to this piece of dross is beyond characters are changed situations are dropped and to see dramatic break-in reduced to nesbitt doing a quick chin up and sliding open a bay window it brought tears to my dread to think going to happen with country of the blind if this is the just avoid it
i guess you have to give some points for the sheer courage of writing a musical around a history lesson but how about some decent music the cartoonish acting of howard desilva meant to pique the interest of otherwise jaded children william daniels campy contemporary the time acting style meant to appeal to a demographic we need all the in-jokes about ny nj can hear the blue-haired broadway audience guffawing on cue i find the whole piece dated boring the acting far too strident for the screen
a dog found in a local kennel is mated with satan and has a litter of puppies one of which is given to a family who has just lost their previous dog to a hit run the puppy wants no time in making like donald trump and firing the mexican housekeeper how festive only the father suspects that this canine is more then he appears the rest of the family loves the demonic pooch so up to dad to say the late made for tv horror flick has little going for it except a misplaced feeling of nostalgia when i saw this as a kid i found it to be a tense nail-biter but revisiting it as an adult i now realize that merely and not really well-acted in the least grade d
this film is the worst film i have ever seen the story line is weak i couldn't even follow it the acting is high-schoolish the sound track is irritating the attempts at humor are not the editing is horrible the credits are even slow i would be embarrassed to have my name associated with this waste of film don't waste your time even thinking about this attempt at acting
the plot character development and gags in this movie are all extremely weak quite a waste of time the conclusion of saving grace is supposed to make one feel warm and fuzzy as though the characters have grown through their struggles there was no such development to make such warm fuzzy feelings possible the drug gags are cliched and much of the movie doesn't ring true to life the plot builds what is supposed to be tension but the characters aren't developed enough to care then it rushes through a resolution of all the outstanding problems in about a minute of screen time leaving the viewer feeling like they have just wasted their time
but thomas ian griffith just doesn't have the polish that a big bucks actor has granted this was made years ago some of the humorous lines could have been timed to make this not only action but comedy and how do you get kc out of katia koslovska anyhow character was so corny he would have fit better in a bullwinkle toon personally if action flicks are going to show skin i'd have liked to have seen equal time between otherwise don't show any
always enjoy great films which deal with the super-natural and the deep thoughts of the spiritual world however this film just turned me off as far as its production and direction there is nothing to go into deep discussion about what this story has to tell all i can say is that it was a big waste of time and effort to put it on the big screen the actors namely mark addy thomas garrett gave an outstanding performance in his native land england and we have seen him in still standing a tv series heath ledger played the real wicked dude and we have recently viewed him in brokeback gave a great supporting role shannyn sossaman sinclair did a good job of seducing a priest from a church not recognized by any faith don't waste your time you will be sorry
there is absolutely nothing in this movie that shows even the tiniest scrap of talent nobody in it has ever tried acting before even the extras in the coffee shop look as if they've been glued in place nothing looks film quality is terrible most of the action takes place in narrow corridors or apartments with the cameraman crammed in as an afterthought swinging some cheapo camera backwards and forwards between actors as they deliver their lines no tripod and no proper microphone either there sound quality is terrible even manos fares better than this at least they had proper equipment what plot there is simply gets lost in the production to home videos preferably made by some year kid trying out the video feature on new camera phone you will be in for a long search to find a movie more inept than this
a far as b-movies go scarecrow is one of those that are so bad that it becomes incredibly annoying to sit through a lonely loser high school student who is constantly picked on by classmates and rejected by girls ends up walking in on his trailer trash mother having sex with a drunk redneck he then chases the kid out into a nearby cornfield and kills him apparently the kids soul was transfered into a scarecrow which then goes around killing the bullies who tormented him as well as teachers this scarecrow aside from having a snappy one-liner for each of his victims can also do matrix-like flips through the air and kill people on sidewalks in broad daylight also why did he always look like a rotted corpse just like the two needless sequels that followed this this isn't even worth a laugh
the entire movie is flashbacks from the first boogeyman movie as well as inexplicably footage from another uli lommel suzanna love film brainwaves it is framed with some more current the early anyway footage that is boring poorly acted and cheaply shot not only is the film almost completely flashbacks they repeat the same flashbacks throughout the film so you see the recycled footage over and over again as if you hadn't seen it already as if the originals weren't bad enough i've never seen a movie so padded someone was milking the last dollar out of these films total ripoff and talk about padding why do i have to write lines about this trash if i can convey that garbage in lines that should be enough
i wanted to see an action comedy with a satirical twist this film was touted but this one failed me miserably for me the plot was a bit confusing to follow and i rapidly lost interest i feel so sorry for john cusack joan cusack ben kingsley marisa tomei and hillary duff for getting involved with this movie i'll remain a fan of all of them but only time can heal my feeling over this one the one thing i can say positively about the film is that hillary played character so well that i didn't even recognize hillary it took me a few scenes to realize that it was her luckily i rented it for through red box had i paid to see it in on the big screen i would be really fuming
if there was a scale below it would get a following in the footsteps of godspell the acting there was such a thing was atrocious the plot in shambles and rene russo was sickeningly sweet in her role enough to make a person retch ten thumbs down for a dumb movie saving grace kudos for era costuming
i have a high tolerance for the weird but frankly some movies go way way beyond far that they make your brain hurt this is such a film trying to understand it or even explain it is impossible and i think the film is best understood while taking that film begins with some very cute japanese animation involving a cat however out of the blue tons of twisted and occasionally disturbing things me wonder if i am losing something in the translation however even if this is so why did we need to be treated to images of a magic trick involving dismembering a lady with a clever defecation puking lighting animals on fire etc all this really seemed random and pretty awful oddly and i don't know why some see this as a work of genius i just don't get that
who in their right mind does anything so stupid as this killing of a security guard characters that are so two dimensional that a two year old could have painted drawn them and red toolbox of death weak from this movie shifts between teen comedy thriller voyeurism and female and an insult to any thinking person do not watch walk away more horrible than you may on top of it all trying to be hip by being overly graphic in montford shoot em up was fun and funny this is just pathetic and terrible good luck next time
this film is terrible you don't really need to read this review further if you are planning on watching it suffice to say don't you are studying how not to make a good acting is horrendous serious amateur hour throughout the movie i thought that it was interesting that they found someone who speaks and looks like michael madsen only to find out that it is actually him a new low even for plot is terrible people who claim that it is original or good have probably never seen a decent movie before even by the standard of hollywood action flicks this is a terrible watch it go for a jog instead at least you won't feel like killing yourself
this movie is a prime example of squandering great resources in a film you've got future snl and sctv stars in their prime such as john candy chevy chase laraine newman al davis and joe flaherty essentially making minutes of coarse uninspired fart and racist jokes the concept of a network from the future subverting society could have really been taken to some interesting extremes but instead right out the gate makes a lame juvenile proctology joke and stays in that vein of humor the whole out the earlier and much more subversive and witty groove tube or the later hilarious kentucky fried movie this movie is only for those who want to see a time capsule of bad sketch comedy movies
well i can once and for all put an end to the question what is the worst movie ever it is flight of fury starring and co-written by steven seagal sure there are lots of famously bad movies but this one takes the cake in that it takes itself so is a romanian-made film that speaks to just how far romania has to go to catch up with bollywood it also speaks to just how utterly devoid of intellect and talent steven seagal has become this movie is so bad that you literally feel violated after watching it and need to crouch in the corner of the shower and cry knowing that nothing will make you feel clean was released only on video can't imagine why and i suspect the workers that had to make the had to wear protective gear and receive regular counseling
this film is really terrible terrible as in it is a waste of minutes of your life special effects are so terrible the acting wasn't about a crocodile that attack a view tourists as they are filming a documentary about blood surfing blood surfing is when they surf around sharks but it turns terrible wrong when a foot crocodile interrupts there holiday the sharks don't look real the crocodile is even worse and it gets even more pathetic when they are running away form the creature but the crocodile gets stuck and females flash it the deaths are fake and the pirates are just to fill in pointless terrible film thats not worth seeing
superhero movies pretty much always suck and this is no exception its only redeeming quality is the fact the movie could have been even worse i would put batman robin and steel above this movie so yes it is that your looking for a black superhero check out blankman its not a serious superhero movie but at least its entertaining
when i noticed that hamish macbeth was being broadcast in the united states i was thrilled i then had the misfortune to watch the darn thing i adore m c books about the wonderful scottish constable the characters in the book are entertaining and very well-written the powers that be who are responsible for this mish-mash apparently have never have read one of books only the name hamish macbeth has anything to do with the series besides the lack of familiar characters i find the whole show offensively loud it seems that the actors feel they must shout their lines and scream at each other if you love m c adorable hamish macbeth don't waste your time on this rubbish
absolutely one of the worst movies of all production values terrible story idea bad script lackluster acting and i can't even come up with an adjective suitably descriptive for how poor joan directing is i know that a special place in hell for the people who financed this film prolly right below the level reserved for child-raping genocidal movie is a x rabbit this at all so bad it isn't even funny how bad it is
possibly not but it is awful even the fantastic cast cant save it ok i admit it started off quite funny but it seemed to plummet downhill as soon as they jumped those girls in the generals house bill murray turned from being a quick witted humorous guy into an arsehole who was shouting things at people in the street that just weren't funny its like he was trying too hard to be funny his character stole a weapon rv come on and ends up being a national hero after invading another country and killing god knows how many soldiers for a laugh one good point is that this film shows the inadequacy and incompetence of the us army and shows how arrogant and imbecilic they really are albeit unintentionally i actually felt disgusted that this kind of propaganda crap could really be released
fragmentaric movie about a couple of people in austria during a heatwave this kind of movie has been done more often and most of all better the stories don't really have anything to do with each other apart from the pathetic finale people are cruel ugly flesh unpleasant people and a movie that goes on way too long without really making a point ultra-realistic hardly boring indeed not even gorgeous franzisca weiss can save this one
sorry someone has to say it this really a dull movie worthy perhaps but dull nonetheless i nearly cried with boredom when watching it the acting is pretty dire the story drawn out and predictable the score and camera-work totally standard and unexciting one of those movies you are not allowed to hate it is about disabled people but hate it i suspect nearly everyone does it is interesting that critics have been so kind to this movie i suppose they too are not allowed to be objective this was made to win awards which i remember it duly did but it was neither interesting nor entertaining i haven't seen the play so cannot compare
hard to praise this film much the cgi for the dragon was well done but lacked proper modelling for light and shadow also the same footage is used endlessly of the dragon stomping through corridors which becomes slightly was amazed to see marcus aurelius in the acting credits wondering what an ex-emperor of the roman empire was doing acting in this film like whoopie goldberg it must be an alias and can one blame him for using one if he appears in this story might been interesting but the acting is flat and direction is tedious if you must watch this film go around to your house and get drunk while doing so then it'll be enjoyable
there have been more interesting polish documentaries on worm farming in the competition farming had a better plot and more interesting characters i was physically ill after watching this movie the cheating husband think was a joke in every meaning of the word poor jennifer must really need the work and what was with the accent the locations and random meetings reminded me of a high school prank and showed the humility of a year old in cooking class it was that bad that i think i will write the sequel named this is not a laxitive thank you for listening it was a great weight of my conscious
a group of people are invited to there high school reunion but after they arrive they discover it to be a scam by an old classmate they played an almost fatal prank on now he seeks to get revenge on all those that hurt him by sealing all the exits and cutting off all telephone slasher film with an unexceptional premise bringing it up a notch are a few good performances some rather creative death scenes plenty of excitement scares some humor and an original for extreme violence graphic nudity sexual situations profanity and drug use
this has got to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen it is think a story of a rebellious college basketball player his tough-but-fair coach his girlfriend and a fellow student by michael margotta who has continual nervous breakdowns the story goes nowhere there is zero character development there is nobody to care about and the performances with the exception of bruce dern as the coach are terrible it is hard to believe how a talent like jack nicholson could direct such an awful movie make sure to avoid this turkey
i'm here again in your local shopping mall course cause where the high school kids hang out to demonstrate how awful bendy poo prom courier really is to prove how bad this joke of a dcom this going to take these four sumo wrestlers and stuff them into this photo booth huuuuuuuarrrrghhhhhh uh awful is it so bad disney channel flushes away its money yet again with those exciting yet determining promos keeping the viewers wondering when is this going to be on and then suddenly when it does come on for one this not only got a higher tv rating than usual but this was only seen once oh no one time everyone plus this movie is about high school and stuff and believe me i will not go any further with what else is in this one at all costs
i was duped into seeing this movie after reading a positive review from another website and man was i it took me at least minutes to pick it up off the shelf i didn't want anyone to see me then another minutes to build the courage to take it to the counter and actually use real money to rent it i thought that all my stress would pay off by the time i got home to and watching the movie the review i read said the movie was a pleasant surprise what a joke if you can make it through the first hour of the movie then your in luck not until then the movie into a horror don't bother with this one folks your better off watching dankness falls
this may not be the worst comedy of all time but close the producers of this movie stole an hour and a half of my life and i want it kattan is funny for about minutes his high pitched voice and mad flailing start to get old and then you realize that the rest of the movie is much worse he falls into a long line of former snl-ers that have attempted movies some have been brilliant some have failed miserably not much middle ground in this category although chris farley was brilliant and then okay and then not so funny and then i suppose he hits the entire spectrum in one this movie like the
first of all i just want to say that i love this show but this episode makes a mockery of the entire don't know what they tried to achieve with this episode but they successfully created the worst episode in the entire is no story line everything is chaotic and the way they tried to answer some of the remaining questions in the game for example how do the furlings look like by creating that stupid previously simply clear that the writers are running out of ideas and that is really too bad
i just saw this film last night in the tribeca film festival and it seriously makes me wonder if the folks at the festival actually screen the films before selecting them the film was simply awful i say that without hyperbole or ulterior motives it was awful matthew days as a leading man are way over gina gershon sported an inexplicable and unnecessary english accent she should be ashamed of her participation in this film gloria reuben had a weird little cameo in it she should also be ashamed the script was terrible and the we were given absolutely no reason to care about the characters i highly doubt this will be picked up but then again people in hollywood are known to make mistakes sometimes i really think kettle of fish is a serious contender for the worst movie i've ever seen
this movie was long and boring surprising that it was selected for cannes although they tend to like pretentiousness point is that contrary to other dutch stars of the arty genre like kerkhof and kruishoop guernsey feels utterly empty even more so it has no cinematic quality whatsoever a long opening shot doesn't mean cinematic depth just a long boring shot the story wasn't interesting and the characters had problems i couldn't identify with at all the actors didn't shine under her direction and seemed lost at times leopold tried but she is not the talent i hoped she would be where are kerkhof and kruishoop they really made some waves in dutch cinema leopold just made another attempt
was it foreshadowing when tori complained that her first boyfriend was treating her like a robot and then her new boyfriend murderer turned out to be a designer of artificial intelligence i think so scenes to make you squeal with delight montages galore a strip-tease in a kimono do you call it when you seductively put clothes on instead of take them off and a climactic battle on skis definitely tune in for the beginning and end but you can grab a sandwich during the second act when all the plot is happening is it better than co-ed call girl nah does tori ever make it to paradise or out of the snow even nope
i saw brigadoon on tv last night sept i am years old and have been watching films as long as i can remember i can truthfully say that brigadoon stands alone as by far and away the worst film i have ever seen the accents were shameful the local club would have produced better sets the characters were so wooden that they probably contracted dry rot from the tears of the patrons who had the misfortune to watch them it is to be hoped that the stars of this film had hides thick enough to protect them from the embarrassment which they must have suffered on seeing this film the owners of this tripe should perform a great service to mankind and destroy all copies of this film
terrible use of scene cuts all continuity is lost either by awful scripting or lethargic direction that villainous robot musta been a jazz dancer also one of the worst sound tracks i've ever heard usually drowned out by music and where'd they get their props that ship looks like a milk carton i did better special effects on at the age of recommend any film student should watch this flick minutes at a time so as to learn how not to produce a film or was it the editors really too bad because the scenario was actually a good concept just poorly executed all the way around malcom you should have sent a stunt double you're too good an actor for such a stink-bomb
this is one of those movies that apparently was trying to ride the martial arts wave craze kind of like billy jack i guess however whereas billy jack did have one notable martial arts scene there are none in this one unless you consider some gentlemanly grappling and roughhousing as such we are introduced to the star who is described as having learned judo in the marines i was in the marines and while they are pretty established in boxing i really don't remember any emphasis on judo as a result the antagonist james macarthur makes reference to the judo when he offers an excuse for why he a state champion wrestler was so easily defeated lame
a propaganda film for the palestinian cause if you were expecting an unbiased documentary on the israeli-palestinian conflict you will need to look elsewhere if you are an anti-semite merely an wrong with advocating the destruction of a country right or uncritically in support of palestinian goals mass murder the destruction of israel this is the documentary for you should make for an entertaining evening on college campuses around the uk and us however any informed and intellectually honest person would be outraged at the sheer number of lies presented in this video i just hope those who truly are unaware of the situation aren't corrupted by this anti-semitic filth
intensive care by dorna von rouveroy is easily one of the worst horror movies ever extremely cheap dutch slasher flick offers some gore and plenty of absurd horror veteran george kennedy is completely wasted as as professor acting is action is slow and the climax is famous surgeon has a car lies in a coma seven years and then he wakes up and goes on a bloody care is clearly influenced by american slasher films including halloween and friday the killings are hilarious and the dialogs are painfully if you are in the right mood you can give this piece of trash a laugh until it hurts with this one-you can believe me
this absolute trash is based so closely on the friday the series that is practically a carbon copy accept for it being an australian film with people who can't upon a time a young boy got burnt up accidentally during the filming of a music video at lake eildon now a number of years later the boy is all grown up and taking revenge on anybody who comes to the lake to film a music video it is cliche-ridden and a waste of time and money see it only out of curiosity or if you're an aspiring actor trying to learn how not to be able to act lead role alan dale used to star in the television soap opera neighbours but ended up in the x files how did that happen
right you heard me i am a huge fan of james patterson i own of his books and i have read the entire series about lindsey boxer in my opinion the screenwriter should be shot right did any film maker have to slaughter a terrific work of fiction and make it into a mockery of the mystery genre if i ever thought that harry potter was butchered then michael o'hara has proved me wrong can only pray that the next screenwriter who tackles this fabulous book will do it a great deal more justice to michael o'hara and russell mulcahy don't quit your day job
i have just watched the movie for the first time i wanted to watch it as i like drew barrymore and wanted to see one of her early movies movie is about a girl by young and beautiful drew barrymore who moves from nyc to la in order to get over her recently troubled loss short after moving to a guy who falls in love with her it becomes obvious that she has an evil who haunts movie is quite poor and lousy both the dialogs and the acting make the film not really worth seeing it summing up it is just something for the fans of drew barrymore
this is my first movie review on imdb i was forced to register after watching this movie i cannot in good conscience allow this movie to be unreviewed by me the people must be of all my rating is in love jack black ben stiller rachel weis and christopher walken and yet i hated this movie there is a plot but who cares when no script the dialogue is unreal and plain boring the situations are contrived the flow of events is slow and somewhat arbitrary the characters are unsympathetic and uninteresting and the story although based on a good premise is stupid this movie is a piece of mind wasting money on this movie not even worth your time spent watching it please do not see it i beg of you
visually cluttered plot less incredibly mind-numbing rubbish not even close to better work avoid at all overlapping split screen effects do nothing more than confuse the film is very dark for a lot of the time and the artistic composing of images is pretentious in the is absolutely nothing to recommend about this film even the nudity is incredibly unerotic which seeing it fills a large part of the film soon gets very how anyone can say that the acting of ewen macgregor is brilliant is beyond me he showed more ability in the star wars series and saying not been so unimpressed with a film since i saw darby o'gill and the little people
i enjoyed the previous ittenbach movie that i'd seen burning moon but while that movie was rather grim and nasty premutos seems to mostly play it for laughs while its admirable how ittenbach made this movie with no money in his spare time the dvd documentary is worthwhile to see this i found myself constantly battling not to fast-forward to the next gore scene sure gore and if all you want then go ahead and enjoy but be warned an inordinate amount of lame comedy and tedious story exposition many are comparing this to peter movies especially braindead but looking at what jackson did on a similar budget in bad taste clear ittenbach is lacking one thing that jackson has talent pretty good and plentiful gore effects and for getting the most out of limited resources but not worth the money i paid for it
one of the worst movies i ever saw my only thought was how can i get my money back from hollywood video this is no way worth four dollars or any dollars i think it was an attempt to rip off the mexican or vin movies but it failed miserably to do acting was terrible i felt sorry for the actors that they couldn't find something better to do with their time the story was ridiculous we were calling out the lines ahead of the actors it was so predictable the mexican accent of the leading lady was insultingly exaggerated worse than a cartoon it
the problems with this film are many but i will try to mention the most glaring and bothersome ones first of all while the theme suggests a number of vignettes about manhattan life the reality was that everything as usual in movies and tv was about something bizarre usually of a sexual nature the story lines were thin or nonexistent and virtually every scene camera shot line of dialog and expressed emotion was absolutely and totally fake it finally reached a point after an hour of so of mind numbing garbage that i walked out no uncommon for me in recent years i would have guessed the was directed by some wannabe auteur drop outs from some rate film studies program but i believe the one time pre-amelia mira nair took part in this disgusting travesty so perhaps the directorial talent in america has descended en masse into the cesspool
tedious girls-at-reform-school flick which plays somewhat like a prison movie chris blair is stuck in there after running away from her abusive father once in the de facto jail she is gang raped by her fellow female at minutes with an utterly pointless ending which makes the entire film seem year old linda blair does her best to avoid showing her body when unclothed but lets a nipple shot slip during a shower out of
i have to admit i've caught this one a few times on the usa network just something about the well sheer stupidity of this flick which makes me want to watch it whenever on yes you're right about the sub-par acting the plot which only an seven year old could like etc but i can't help feeling sympathetic toward some of the actors then again a few of these actors signed up for the even more atrocious sequel
what was the purpose of this film i suggest it was to make a handful of actors and their producers and director a big payday for doing nothing even my favorite actor bruce dern couldn't keep my interest in this boring movie a braindead ex-pugilist falls in with a weird woman and her relatives he starts out as a fix-it man for the woman and winds up beating a man and getting caught up in a kidnapping scheme it was so confusing i can't even write a decent critique if you see this one my sweet make sure it is after dark so you can go right to sleep
my friends and i rented that movie last night and we had one of the greatest laughs in awhile the movie is not supposed to be funny at all but it is just so ridiculous and it lacks any realism whatsoever first phillippe forget what his character is called and i don't really care uses his regular employee id to go through all the top-security terminals not only is that pathetic but it gets topped when his enormous efforts culminate in his finding the so-scary lego-room which hosts the super computers this is plain funny the tense mood that we are supposed to experience is completely spoilt by the childish looking room the ending like all else is very very very cheesy especially when the bad lawyer shows up right on time anyway this movie is a good laugh if you need something to make fun of definitely see it
overrated and only for those people in their whom wear particularly thick rose tinted glasses who never actually saw it in the first place because they were to young awful animation dialogue and a tired narrative a real product of the the novel gimmick of a puzzle toy right toy not the absurd pretentious and child alienating collectors action figurine sold on the back of a poor cartoon and other paraphernalia only matters to those who bought the toy when they were actual children in the period of to it has become cult because of those same adults are to immature to let go of their memories avoid
what the title should be movie combines guns explosives and mindless killing to make one flop of an action movie let me make my point in a series of questions answers type happens in the movie people that it is the plot about what is the point the movie is trying to make killing is the only are the characters like extremely flawed and contradictive toward their own there anything good about this movie yes i'm sure they used some nice panavision cameras in filming you like constant killing and greed then watch the movie if you happen to be repulsed by such low-standard entertainment then made men is not for sum it up the plotline stinks the characters aren't worth their while the storyline is completely resistable and nothing fits proves one thing the actors directors and whoever helped make this movie certainly aren't made
this movie is the worst movie i have ever seen it is humorous how bad it is the entire time i was watching it i half expected music to start and the doctor starts seen with a better plot when the raptor was trying to get in the door i think someone was throwing a plastic doll against the door from about feet away but as i said it is so bad you need to watch it so that you can see just how bad it is me explaining it isn't going to do anything compared to if you watch it i don't recommend renting it but if it comes on tv watch it for about just to see what i mean i couldn't watch more than but if you can sit through the whole thing then you have some good willpower
wonderful cast wasted on worthless script ten or so adults reunite at the summer camp they attended as juveniles could this ever happen in a million years simply a fantasy and a boring one at that do they become teenagers again do they reenact their pranks games good times they may try but ultimately the answer is no is there any intrigue any suspense horror comedy none of the above how anyone can be entertained by this drivel is beyond me i wanted to like this movie i tried to like this movie but my brain refused
from the critical acclaim i expected more from this movie and from tamara jenkins the story just meandered along and didn't seem to have a point or a plot and i find it hard to believe that a year old girl for her age or no would be so blase about getting the loss of her virginity over with maybe i am too young to relate was four years old in but i didn't have any problems connecting with the stories of shakespeare in love or life is beautiful and i wasn't alive for either of those settings the cast is very good but unfortunately for them the script did not alow them to engage the audience overall slums had its moments but unless you are yearning to reminisce over halter tops and tube socks i would say skip this one
very bad film very very very bad film a rarity but it defenitly is not worth hunting down this italian jaws rip-off makes little sense most of the time and no sense the rest the alligator is not at all convincing and many of the sub-plots go nowhere if at the local video store you may want to watch it if you're a fan of monster movies but not worth hunting down
neat premise very unrealistic what i learned from this movie is that speeding crazily out of control to go to the weekend cabin may not be the best idea after all i loved how bill conveniently rolls out of the car and down the hill with no injury at all unfortunately the same can't be said for his gal oh and the police never seemed to find the car or trace the owner of the of dragged out scenes including a plain stripper have nightmares from that scene poor assistant guy and his crummy useless hand i admit i was intrigued to see what the mysterious thing was behind the door but when it appeared i just laughed ha ha ha the girl really seemed sadistically angry about being revived personally i really would want a new body after an excruciating experience like that
yaaaaaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwnnnnnnnnnnnnn um excuse me sorry fell asleep there for a mooment now where was i oh yes the projected man yes zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz sorry yes the projected man well a british sci-fi yawnfest about nothing some orange-headed guy projects himself on a laser gets the touch of death at last he vanishes the end actually the not even that interesting dull droning starchy stiff and back-breakingly boring the projected man is solid minutes of nothing starring nobody dull as dishwater dull as doorknob dust dull as ethan hawke we're talking really dull here people but wait in respect to our dull cousins from across the puddle the moocow will now do a proper review for the projected
this movie barely followed the story line of the movie all of the fascinating points in the book didn't even exist in the movie they ended up turning it into a cheesy tween disney movie crush story between meg and calvin it was so bad it should have been hillary duff playing the part or one of the likes this movie was nothing more than an insult to the intelligence and mysticism of the book i can't believe disney could even get away with making such a cheap basic rendition if you've ever read the book i think you would agree it could easily be made into a movie of lord of the rings equivalence this movie should have never been able to use the title of a wrinkle in time poorly done
this dumb comedy really does a good job of wasting comedic talent in particular dan aykroyd and howard hesseman are misused badly here i might have chuckled once or twice during this film but in general a boring movie with a little bit of stupidity thrown in for good measure the premise although routine still wasn't bad but once the plot was set the film went nowhere don't waste your time with this misfire
i saw the movie as a child when it was released in the theater and it was so bad that it became the makings of a family joke if the ranking had a zero this movie would get it the dinosaurs were awful the storyline was ridiculous the acting really doesn't qualify to be called acting the only reason i even remember the name of the movie so well is because my family still talks about how bad it really was
i really looked forward to this program for two reasons i really liked jan michael vincent and i am an aviation nut and have a serious love affair with helicopters i don't like this program because it takes fantasy to an unbelievable level the world speed record for helicopters was set at mph by a westland lynx several years ago the only chopper that was ever faster was the experimental lockheed in the it hit over and was a compound helicopter which means it had a pusher propeller at the end of its fuselage providing short no helicopter can fly much over because of the principle of rotary wing flight and the bell the actor that portrayed airwolf wasn't very fast even by helicopter standards and it didn't stay in production very was a movie that came out during this time period called blue thunder that was much more realistic
i'd like to think myself as a fairly open minded guy and it takes a for me to dislike a movie but this one is without a doubt one of the suckiest crappiest movie i've ever have no idea wrong with the people who gave it such a good rating here is usually pretty reliable when it comes to ratings the only thing i can imagine is that people must've voted during one or more while being shitfaced stoned out of their minds they've received hard cash for the votes under can't believe i wasted a good h min of my life for this pathetic excuse for a movie
the dereks did seem to struggle to find rolls for bo after used to work for a marine park in the florida keys one day the script for ghosts can't do it was circulating among the trainers in the fish house where food was prepared for the dolphins there was one scene where a supposedly propositions bo bo the dolphin asking to go make eggs reading the script we did not end up doing any portion of this movie at our facility although our dolphins in the big must have been very close to the end of anthony life i hope he had fun in this film as it certainly didn't do anything for his legacy
but certainly not without merit already writer-director preston sturges is experimenting with unusual cinematic effects in telling his stories creating broadly drawn yet distinctive characters and situations and writing clever and sometimes unexpectedly wise and compassionate dialogue wonder the coen brothers next movie is going to be an homage to major problem is that the not all the way there yet it lacks surprise the unexpected plot twists and sudden changes of fortune that keep viewers guessing the coffee slogan is a lousy thing to hang the plot upon and the ending is thoroughly predictable frank capra does this sort of thing much you're new to preston sturges check out the lady eve or travels or the miracle of creek first if you've seen these already then go ahead and watch this one
please do not waste any money on this movie it really is nothing more than a boring german blair witch ripoff made by some high school kids i couldn't finish watching it and usually i like watching all kinds of b-movies how on earth could they find a distributor for it funny however check out wikipedia for dark area the guy who wrote the entry must be completely out of his mind maybe he got loads of money from the producers money that should have been spend on actors camera and editing even that wouldn't have helped since there is absolutely no interesting idea behind this film unfortunately dark area has already gotten too much attention please director producer and author of this movie stop making movies like are not doing yourself a favor the world would be a better place without this film
my first clue about how bad this was going to be was when the video case said it was from the people who brought us blair witch project which was a masterpiece in comparison to this piece of garbage the acting was on the caliber of a grade production of oklahoma and the plot such as there was is predictable boring and inane of the script is four letter words and innumerable variations on them mother f seems to be the favorite because it is used constantly it must have taken all of minutes to write this script in some dive at last call thank god i rented it and could jump through most of it on fast forward don't waste your time or money with this
oh my god please for the love of all that is holy do not watch this movie it it minutes of my life i will never get back sure i could have stopped watching half way through but i thought it might get better it didn't anyone who actually enjoyed this movie is one seriously sick and twisted individual no wonder us zealanders have a terrible reputation when it comes to making movies everything about this movie is horrible from the acting to the editing i don't even normally write reviews on here but in this case i'll make an exception i only wish someone had of warned me before i hired this catastrophe
at first three words read the book really guys this demonstrates the difficulties of genuine rendition of esoteric matters i loved the book and was utterly disappointed of the film it was ludicrous with half a heart and the story bad explained the novel in the first place wasn't meant to focus on an adventure only the surroundings in the film the focus reverses to just that and the message has taken a back seat additional the visual effects to show the energy of all living things and the elucidation of the events at the end were parsimonious they screwed it up i'll never watch it again
watched out of sykes mindless movie about flesh-eating zombies in a story within a movie chronicle and yes we get to see zombies eating human flesh parts in wow not that has been done time and time again in in a zombie movie but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story not the actual flesh-eating what made the original zombie classics good the flesh-eating was just thrown in as an extra we're actually bored throughout most of this chronicle because of the like easily understood and slow-pacingly revealed the last story is actually the story the movie started a reporter investigating a so-called ghost town and of course we get to see flesh eating in that one as well well i think i've said enough watch the classics not this bore-feast
a memorable line from a short lived show after viewing the episode where that line was introduced my fraternity intramural flag football team started using the line to break our huddles on offense instead of ready break our quarter back said football and the rest of the squad responded you bet a fun way to break the huddle that had our opponents scratching their heads as very few of them had watched the show using this line added a unique element to our season that i'll never forget we had our best season during my time in college that year and in a small way it was due to the fun that we had using this line the show was pretty much a stinker but it lives on in the memories of the pi kappa phi intramural flag football squad at west virginia tech
this movie is so bad it hurts the car doing mph when supposed to go the shift lever stuck park the nurse that drives for almost hours with the cell phone on the any of the morons take this damn phone nothing credible in this crap i would be ashamed to be seen in a movie like this
does this film suck horrible acting horrible script horrible effects horrible horrible horrible nothing redeeming here for even the most die-hard of horror fans a crazy killer stalks students at a college people are showing up dead in the hallways but still class carries on as normal after about the body i would think that they could allow the students a few days break lol this about as bad as it gets folks this film should be shown as a means of torture to criminals you have been warned
in an attempt to bring back the teen slasher genre that was taken away by spoofs like scary movie and shriek if you know what i did last friday the valentine fails why did people like halloween because it was original new and went beyond anything ever been done why did they like scream because at least it made sense valentine is just a stupid slasher-flick that has hardly any gore what so-ever the plot is so similar to halloween and urban legend not funny and the moment the killer comes on screen you know who it is just sssssssssssooooooooooooo predictable the teen slasher genre is dead get over out of
this film is horribly acted written directed and produced but so campy actually semi-watchable semi storyline little there is makes virtually no sense whatsoever the barney drum character is the only real comic relief in the movie and that gets tired after about seconds of the canadian supporting cast can be found in tv commercials none of them went on to anything else that i'm aware of and of course sly even less talented brother well it was filmed almost entirely in and around the little village of claremont ont miles of toronto i recognized many local i think the drive-in scene was filmed at the now demolished oshawa drive-in just before it was torn down
tom sprawling brilliantly observed satiric novel of life among new york snobbery gets a glossy look here but is nevertheless not well served the film suffers not merely from the miscasting of everyman tom hanks as an uncaring yuppie kewpie-doll melanie griffith as a manipulative southern belle and bruce willis as the darling of new literati the most serious miscasting was in the chair robert altman might have breathed life into these unlikeable characters and made them interesting but brian de palma for all of his visual sophistication has never had an eye for the nuances of the human experience the resulting film looks good but seems blah toward its subject of dehumanization in favor of status honestly if a satire does not make the viewer angry what is the point
oh my god this is without a doubt the absolute cheesiest movie i have ever seen the acting is bad the story is weak the characters are weaker and the whole film just doesn't make sense couple this with mediocre directing really strange scenes as the one where the kid reaches over the ravine and mysteriously falls in and thoroughly abysmal dialog musta peed his pants and you get one complete failure not to mention the fact that the only thing mr atlas looks like he could defeat is a case of chocolate bars but this is part of the charm sit down and watch it with a few of your friends for a good laugh love this movie because just so bad
i was interested in the topic and only fans of drew dancing on david desk will find anything remotely interesting in it ok she shows some breast maybe a body double does the plot is slashed to bits and the acting is horrible neither lead has any material to work with as the direction of the film leads nowhere don't waste your time see donnie darko instead if you want a creepy drew barrymore film and if you want to see another skip this and see darko treatment of the doppelganger legend is absolutely criminal as well refer to charles williams novel descent into hell for something worth considering instead this is just an excuse to make a b film to go straight to video and suck some life out of people at makes any of these people think the acting here was praiseworthy give me a break
this was a rip-off of the same garbage we had to watch bob saget host during the half-hour before this dave coulier only thought he was funny and it was pretty much the same show as funniest home videos except with a hosts who have a combined iq of three tawny kitaen must've really needed the money and coulier had to go to the recycle bin for his jokes it was torture enough having to see him imitate popeye and other washed up cartoon starts on full house that one dude who played all of the practical jokes on everyone deserves to be on the receiving end of a grade a wedgie coulier must've needed to money to please alannis morisette while they were dating
i am sorry to say that this film is indeed bad it reminds me of a c-grade porn movie with one major difference no story and dialogue needs a complete overhaul maybe then the bad acting would not have been as noticeable at the very least the pacing should have been picked i accept that this had a low budget and the director did a good job visually given what little resources he had he should have spent more time on the story or better yet get someone else to write it many of the action scenes were just was a complete waste of my time
unbelievably awful film i watched part of this on recently my jaw dropped as i watched a horrendously conceived plot and listened to mind-numbing drivel not a single line from the master of one-liners could come close to producing anything resembling a chuckle it was so bad it made me want to exhume rodney body slap him around and scream how could you i know many films are done in haste hoping to cash in on the popularity of a given actor or theme but please hollywood show a little respect for your audience sad and scary that people were expected to pay to see such tripe the bottom of the cesspool even by sunday afternoon television standards
the first point that calls the attention in for ever mozart is the absence of a plot summary in imdb the explanation is simple since there is no story screenplay plot or whatever might recall the minimum structure of a movie jean-luc godard is one of the most overrated and pretentious directors of the cinema industry and this pointless crap is among his most hermetic films i believe that neither himself has understood what is this story about but there are intellectuals that elucubrate to justify or explain this messy movie and it is funny to read their reviews vote is para sempre mozart mozart
this was the third remake of sleeping with the eniemy after and was the only one which worked and was a better is directed by abbas mustan who sadly failed in their attempt story was good but the handling wasn't that good and the heroine was shown too regressive and the climax too was is bad music is reprises his role of which also was a remake of swte and looks too fat for the lead and is okay juhi is decent while arbaaz tries too hard in his debut and does manage in many scenes to chill the audiences but his voice was terrible johny is too loud
the first scene in problem child has a baby peeing into a face for this movie witty a nasty mean-spirited comedy inept on so many levels it beggars belief john ritter is the kind father who adopts the child from hell and kudos to him for maintaining his dignity in the surrounding onslaught of one-note annoying performances and puerile humour and what the jack warden doing in this mess slackly directed by dennis dugan and obnoxious in its attempts to turn on the sentimentality when done with the crudity the movie is made so badly quite a bizarre experience but never mind all that the lowlight of the whole thing is michael oliver the most repulsive and unlikeable kid actor ever to hit the screen believe me you will want to smack him right in the mouth
what can i say i think i have to write spoiler alert and then reveal they used the f-word a lot in this movie like in every two sentences i did not like this movie at all too much hints on sexual perversions sidesteps and cheating and that swearing was totally out the window i gave this movie and two of those points are for mira sexy movements on the dance floor
wow what a total let down the fact people think this film is scary is ridiculous the special effects were a direct rip-off of the ring the story was there one not in my a bunch of flashy imaging the entire film was a boring stupid mess i guess there is always a market for bad films with good marketing campaigns however this is the worst horror film i have seen in years and that buffy chick well a bad actress as plastic as barbie and just as wait that would be an insult to the talents of barbie i suppose many kiddies helped this film at the box office as it was and had it been rated r it would have bombed imo stupid movie
absolute garbage worse fight scenes than a year old van damme movie or american ninja dire acting not a skill in sight in the entire movie its like a cast of wooden it just for how truly bad this film is it may have been acceptable in the but this is a movie i don't have much love for this movie as it wasn't born in the you like real fight movies then check out tony jaa in ong bak and the protector those are proper martial arts a laugh and watch this today you may see the unintenional humour at how grim it is
this is an extremely boring film if you grew up during the vietnam was as i did then you've seen and heard all of the film footage and arguments here a hundred times by now but what really makes this film boring is the narration by director carlton sherwood the majority of the film is shot with sherwood talking directly into the camera about his opinion of this conflicting time in the history of our you're old enough to remember vietnam then you won't find anything new here there is no new evidence to condemn john kerry or new evidence worthy of another documentary on vietnam younger viewers who are interested in the subject should see george excellent film going upriver stolen honor was clearly meant to be a hatchet job on john kerry but it fails miserably at accomplishing that goal
the only words you need fear more than joe don baker if your thinking of watching a film are greydon clark and if they are both there run for your life however this is a very funny film because they actually take themselves seriously it starts out bad and goes downhill from there repeated scenes the good the bad and the ugly like shootout will have you rolling on the floor with laughter yes the best deputy sheriff in texas tracking a mafia hit-man to malta as only he can he makes his own rules does things his own way all the while wearing cowboy boots and sidearms cowboy style you want to see a bad but funny film go ahead on its your move
this wasn't what i wanted to see i bought this on dvd and under the movie i found myself irritated and turned off the movie for a what i didn't they were shooting at the the tribes was really the dinosaurs to the bad scientist well he was the picture quality on the dvd was really i did like the music by jerry goldsmith this music is really great i have the bootleg soundtrack from this movie sadly the sound quality is not good but its ok for its the first time we see the dinosaurs they inspire a sort of baby is kinda cute when he is in the water and is that funny scene with the tent the children who sees this film would hopefully learn that evil always loses
frank creativity must have been just about spent by the time he made this film while it has a few charming moments and many wonderful performers outright recycling of not just the script but considerable footage from his first version of this story broadway bill is downright shoddy it is understandable that he would re-use footage from the climactic horse race which is thrilling but he uses entire dialogue scenes with minor actors then brings back those actors and apparently expects us not to notice for example that ward bond is years older unless you want to see one of the last appearances of oliver hardy skip this one and watch broadway bill instead
i went to see this film based on the review by siskel and ebert not only did i get duped but i took some friends along and had to spend the rest of the day profusely apologizing for making them sit through this pointless crap after this i never went to see a movie based solely on siskel advice
oh dear good cast but to write and direct is an art and to write wit and direct wit is a bit of a task even doing good comedy you have to get the timing and moment right im not putting it all down there were parts where i laughed loud but that was at very few times the main focus to me was on the fast free flowing dialogue that made some people in the film annoying it may sound great while reading the script in your head but getting that out and to the camera is a different task and the hand held camera work does give energy to few parts of the film overall direction was good but the script was not all that to me but i'm sure you was reading the script in your head it would sound good sorry
i haven't seen it in over twenty years oj was the bus driver arte johnson was the tour guide lorenzo was the lorenzo looked very much at home as the villain a natural i think i watched it back then most for oj who i had seen towering inferno and cassandra crossing but also to see arte was a little bored that johnson was so yes it shifted plots in reading other posts i remember that was some plot that they were going to kidnap some rich girl but then that priceless stamp business turned up out of the was going a stamp if it came on as a late movie i would probably record it to check it out again but i wouldn't be nostalgic over it not yet are better movies from the seventies like this to check out
very outdated film with awful clich√©-ridden and mawkish dialog and a very poor construction in addition cassavetes and falk overact constantly a pseudo good movie it takes no time to discover how catastrophic this intellectual turkey is the first scene is a total bore filled with histrionics and hysteric exchanges the sound is horrible camera movements are without imagination as is the building of characters no poetry no subtle psychology no interesting shots the actors smoke constantly and we see ads for beer beverages very cheap indeed exception ned nice and simple way of playing the hit man
keenan ivory wayans is probably one of the worst directors i swear he has no real knowledge on how to make films he has made one brilliant film and that is scary movie scary movie was ok too but everything else keenan has made are real disasters avoid such titles like don't be a menace to south central while drinking your juice in the hood i know what a title obviously this film too just anything that has keenans name in the was an hour and a half on stupid nonsense that never made me laugh just trust me on this maybe women might like this film a little because of some of things that happen but on a whole this film will never be liked by anyone with a good taste in films seaton
very disappointing version of lorna doone too many missing characters no romantic scenes changes in story line too short appeared low budget hardly enough dialogue to understand the story if you're not familiar with the novel in some scenes it looks like lorna has a cold sore on her upper lip i'm sure make-up did best to hide it i guess they didn't want to halt filming until it healed up pity most likely why this movie lacked kissing scenes only one disappointing kissing scene at the very end lorna doone is a great epic tale and should be told true the version of lorna doone is twice as long more romantic much more enjoyable and more true to the book
hmm hip hop music to a period western modern phrases like cool and too many others to keep track of the sistahs are in tha manicured nails on hard riding girls microphone packs clearly visible on li'l back i just can't go on with the litany of errors made by the director and acting isn't as bad as i've ever seen the women did well enough with a poor was weird hearing louis mandylor speaking in his native girls are beautiful the costumes fabulous albeit completely incorrect i just can't believe they would dumb down what could have been a great story i would feel offended to believe that this movie was loaded with such trappings that it would play well in the inner
this movie is a lot like the movie hostel except with acting and not much suspense the gore elements are there but you don't really feel anything for the characters making the violence not very effective some parts are just strange like forcing a snake down someones throat up with that is that supposed to be scary or gory just kind of stupid as for torture there really isn't any for the guy getting blow-torched in the beginning which they don't show anyway the main bad guy keeps saying make them die slowly yet the butcher kills them all very fast the deaths are all relatively quick yes i did watch the unrated version so overall not the worst gore movie i've seen but not at all good either you won't miss anything if you skip this one
i pity people calling kamal hassan ulaganaayakan maybe for them ulagam is tollywood comeon movie is a thriller without out of your ulagam and just watch some high class thrillers like the usual suspects or even the silence of the good but style over substance kamal doesn't look like a police officer there is no thrill whatsoever dragging and boring till end you might be saving valuable hrs of your life if u skip watching this at his best is the best in tollywood
this was the worst movie i have ever seen billy zane in i understand that this movie was mainly to showcase the new comers who did pretty good for newbies but over all the movie was not all of the gunfire you would think the police would have intervened even the coin being a bug on sean was stupid the way sean suddenly realizes the coin is the bug was not like this movie was slapped together fast poor job get a better count down to the end was not in sync with anything it took longer to fight and what a coincidence that each time billy was going to blast sean he'd be out of bullets once i can believe but not twice character was goofy it was so stupid when sean punches him out at the end it was like a comedy bad bad bad
well where do i start i think very insulting to the original annie with aileen quimnn i love the film annie and i was expecting this to be a brilliant film but i was so disappointed the acting is awful the original annie came out a few years before i was born i'm now and annie is still one of my favourite films so i was really excited to see annie the acting was awful in the film were any of the characters original very badly written directed and acted this is not a film i wish to see again and any annie lover i recommend that you don't watch this film because it will only leave you very disappointed the young girls singing isn't bad but still doesn't compare to the original
i've read all the comments on this film i am a great the dalai lama as such i read the book upon which was based the movie is an ugly and demeaning fictionalization of the truth i do not criticize it small details or events for dramatic purposes it a documentary but the script changes the impact and changes in every main character it vastly real relationship between harrar and the young dalai lama the ridiculous rivalry for a tibetan woman culture of tibet to music box gift to of heart everything about this movie is false the amazing photography i understand that the shots of palace were smuggled out of tibet a real story about the relationship between two of them very important to this world in order to build up star is sad
some movies are repellent but still fascinating fiction others are simply boring this movie has an almost unique feature of being both utterly repellent and totally boring by the end i didn't care about any of the characters i just wanted all of them dead so i could get out of the theatre
a film starring salma hayek and colin farrell two respected and talented actors sounds like a great idea an independent film sounds even better the studios will control less of the content allowing the actors and writers and director more then why is this movie so bland ask the film assumes right off the bat that we are deeply invested in the characters no one is given a proper back story so we don't ever know why the characters act the way they for physical and emotional scars are left to our imagination if you still have one left at the end of this told a friend that i went to see this film and that i thought it was question not even colin farrell could save it my response not even colin ass could save it
i actually paid to see this movie in the would get a but the fight scenes between the robots are okay and a realize that some movies have larger budgets than others i don't have a problem with that unfortunately science fiction movies probably suffer the most on a small budget for obvious reasons but one way this movie fails is that just about every piece of each set looked cheesy and cheap i mean couldn't they even make it look other major reason this movie is horrible is the acting if i watched the movie now and knew what to expect i might just enjoy it for the cheese-factor but at the time i was expecting a good movie and had no clue as to how horrible it would actually end up the experience was over in only minutes
trot out every stereotype and misrepresentation you've heard about semi-devout mormons and you'll see they've all starred in this ridiculous excuse for a film finally kurt fortunes have changed goodness and hopefully it will be a long while before we see any of his features in cinematography was amateurish think they used a camcorder for some of the basketball scenes the plot was limp and very unfunny you really didn't understand why anyone did anything it was like i had sand in my eyes and a lady was sitting on my face it was that only reason i didn't give this movie a negative rating was because the scale won't let me
i'm a big fan of sci-fi but this is not one of my favorites while the concept behind the movie was a natural vehicle for a classic teeny bopper sci-fi flick the director counted too heavily on it to carry the movie clear he was working with no money because the entire movie is loaded with bloated dialogue that goes on and on forever i have seen so much time-killing in a are probably less than seconds of blob footage in the entire movie and most of the rest of it is people engaging in a lot of poorly-written run-on dialogue it was fun to see steve m and anita c together but good could casting have thought anyone in their right mind would believe them as teenagers
if you like movies about creepy towns hotels houses states the eagles hotel california etc that possess the people that are just passing through read almost any stephen king novel instead if you like the setting of disappearance start by reading desperation but also check out the shining lot and needful crow motif the desert the family driving in desperation to escape or avoid possession are tired why didn't they just make the film from the desperation novel maybe they approached king and he nixed must dey and harry hamlin look happy to be reunited and they have both worn well over the years but they're still tv and direct-to-dvd caliber actors
this one is just like the movie the movie is really bad it offers nothing in the death department the one-liners are bad and are something that shouldn't be in a noes movie freddy comes off as a happy child in the whole movie lisa wilcox is still the only thing that makes this one worth while the characters are extremely underdeveloped all in all better than the one but still one the worst movies of the series my rating
a below average looking video game is turned into some sort of conspiracy to have the next terrorist discovered in the usa backyard welcome to the lunacy of cheaply made direct to video movies its full of no-name actors and actresses with little valuable this strange game goes on and our hero bets real money and does good at it it is sort of like gambling except the gambling part is gone and it sucks instead its an online game with little real value and you get authorities on your tail if you do makes it even stranger is that two strange computer programs battle it out somehow and all is saved in the end i will leave the viewer to see how it all comes to not even worth a rental borrow it please
i caught this movie on sci-fi before heading into work if you've any interest in seeing dean cain dive and avoid being enveloped in flames at least a dozen times this movie is for you if that doesn't peak your interest well i'm afraid you'll wish that you were the one about to be enveloped in flames because this movie is pretty bad the acting to begin with is awful awful awful the characters are all completely obnoxious and the dialogue is worse than your typical z-grade sci-fi movie towards the end the movie began to remind me of hollow man with escape via elevator shaft except with a dragon not a naked invisible man unlike other similar flicks however this one wasn't even awesomely was just plain bad
the acting in the film is really well done honestly but the movie is so slow and so boring as soon as it gets interesting everything slows to a major halt i am glad to see sam rockwell in this he did a great job so did the other actors as i mentioned but man this is one of the worst dragged out films i have ever seen now maybe in a short film form this movie would be good but other than that avoid it this film has so much filler it makes a twinkie cake jealous never ever walk out on films but watching this one at home with family i walked out yeah it was that boring apparently my comment doesn't have enough lines to post so some more filler i guess i was inspired by the movie i just watched
what a disappointment i hated the mummy but this one was even worse it was very tiring and unbelievable and at a certain point i found myself sighing and yawning all the time i can't believe that people actually liked this movie the role of nicholas cage wasn't very convincing the whole movie felt like a grand tour around most wanted buildings the never stopping flow of hints and combinations wasn't very convincing either i stopped paying attention around minutes what was supposed to be a happy night out became a total disappointment what a drag i guess i've just seen too many movies to enjoy national treasure
i saw an early screening of this film in new york and i along with my friends and pretty much the entire audience were vastly disappointed the movie wasn't even so bad it was good it was as lifeless as a snake-bite victim samual l jackson looked surprisingly tired through most of it and the snake effects were lame it reminded me of one of those cheesy scifi movies except the cheesiness of this movie was not funny or even campy it all seemed worn flat and overtly formulaic i'm shocked to say i actually think anaconda was more fun easy to understand that soap realizes a piece of and plays along with it but what the film fails to embark on is a script that has any scares of suspense the worst kind of lame movie joyless
this program didn't do it for me although i'm a fan of the genre the major factor that disappointed me was that there was not a single scene which was not dominated by the main character this made it a bit two-dimensional and i gave up before the program was was hoping to leave my critique there as i'm no movie critic however the guidelines on imdb state that you must put in lines of commentary it did remind me of hudson hawk in the way the main character is in every single scene and i would hope that the writers of this program could employ some more diversity to engage with the viewers i don't doubt the talent of any of the cast and crew just that after watching things like the wire i've come to expect great things from cop drama
what can i say this movie was so dumb stupid i thought it was a psychotic drag comedy they should rename it bitching pregnant cat fight what a stupid waste of time if you want to die i want your baby drag queen jennifer tilly being her freaky self then just rent out one of the chucky movie oh ya the bride of chucky more fun watching the two ugly plastic dolls of them jennifer tilly turned into the ugly female version of chucky having squeaky plastic rubber sex then watching daryl hannah being pregnant dumb stupid jennifer tilly grinding up her husbang in a food processor reminded me of my mother trying to do house work ok just bad
this is one of the worst movies i've ever seen i saw it at the premiere at sxsw and was extremely disappointed the director knew little about john lennon and even said as much at the premiere this is a drama but people were laughing throughout at how cheesy the film was never a good sign the only saving graces were dominic monaghan and jason leonard as they were funny while the rest of the movie took itself waaay too seriously the cheesy dropping of beatles lyrics was just absurd the soundtrack was excellent however and was probably the best part of the movie unless you're one of those crazy rabid dominic monaghan fans don't bother with this one
we had starz free weekend and i switched on the station to see what was on it was this movie howling ii the acting was terrible but the eye candy was great sybil danning and marsha brown as the afore mentioned eye candy i was laughing a lot from the few scenes i friends wonder why i never want to go to horror movies if they saw this film they would know why i would get thrown out for laughing so a couple of trivia notes reb brown who played ben white had played captain american in a made for tv movie marsha brown was mick jaggers inspiration for the song brown sugar mick has great taste in women for sure
this film is so bad dialogues story actors and actresses everything that hard to imagine that we'll see a worse movie this year or in the following years brother in australia among italian immigrants has nothing but shallow clich√©s about italian culture to offer and it is quite telling that even the italians from and in italy speak english in the film the message of the film ugly people have to marry ugly people beautiful people have to marry beautiful people is truly discomforting giovanni ribisi is quite good in films like suburbia or lost in translation but here his pseudo-italian accent is hard to bear see this film at your own risk trash as trash can
i thought this movie was terrible i'm chinese so i thought everything was totally wrong many of the facts were incorrect the only thing right about chinese history in the movie was when mother explained to her husband about the statues that guarded shihuangdi i also thought the fight scenes were very cheesy and fake many of the actors and actresses were not very great some of the jokes that were supposedly funny were really stupid i think this movie should receive the worst possible rating it could get disney has really got to get more information about chinese history if they want to create an extravagant movie mulan was quite accurate watch this movie if you want to waste some time
after having seen the movie the first question arising in my mind was is this supposed to be irony or not after reading a few comments about the character doc savage and the comic series i knew this film was not meant to be ironic so the story tells us about an us-american super-doc saving a south american republic from evil sounds like a typical story but this one comes in such an unrealistic way that it becomes ridiculous the mandatory end-fight shows the worst presentation of martial arts i have ever seen the film might be interesting for low budget movie designers as a bad example
i agree with the last reviewer that this movie had terrible acting yes there was a lot of gore and some nudity but it was overshadowed by a slow-moving meaningless plot and dumb ending where was this supposed to be filmed anyway a canadian chinatown or hong kong hostel was a much better movie and i would recommend seeing that instead a technical annoyance i had with the dvd is that if you shut off the spanish subtitles they return after a few scenes and then you have to go back to the main menu and turn them off again also don't waste your time on the deleted scenes because no audio and it just looks like tourist footage
nothing can prepare you for another lousy bimbo outing this time being brought to you by the never-inevitable fred olen ray as far as exploitation movies go this one doesn't click as science fiction plain unoriginal all that we see is an an ugly feminine android wearing a bikini out to destroy the earth and showing off all nearly bare to resist give me a break if this kind of entertainment is your thing then why not dust off those old si swimsuit mags from the attic for a change this would have been much better if it didn't set the sleaze factor on very high but that still wouldn't make this one great i'd like to point out another film called the assault by jim wynorski which resembles the identity of alienator it illustrates why top-notch femme fatale action movies don't translate well in america sorry fellas
please for the love of god don't watch it now saying that i know what you're thinking it can't be that bad can it if everyone says it as bad as they say i have to watch it don't do it it'll be like looking at a horrible accident involving little babies and a gasoline tanker you'll be scarred for image will never leave you i could only watch a half hour of this before becoming violently sick the acting is the worst i've ever seen and i've seen barbwire if you do risk ripping your eyes out and rent this say i haven't warned you the cover and storyline are a trap zombies satire shaun of the dead was great this movie must be the no the writing crap directing garbage acting there was no acting still not convinced then forever your soul will be tormented
a plot that fizzled and reeked of irreconcilable differences in opinions constituted a judgmental havoc with one side pro-life and the other a destroyer of a seed the horror was left out and replaced with an overall dull effect quite possibly meant to be horrific but instead demonstrated an ill dose of beliefs which ridiculed each other to death despite the title itself being a fan of masters of horror since the beginning this ridiculous plot twist with sordid depictions crashed apart like a spindly old rocking chair after being sat upon i view this episode as being thrown together from the get go never really taking off anywhere other than to see it through for what its worth and relieved when it finally came to the end
i'll keep this short thanks to greg for helping me to put this succinctly captivity is about a guy who drugs a drink imprisons and tortures her then poses as a captive to have sex with her that is the single twist and punchline of the film torture as slow motion date rape and not even a good movie not so bad good just should also be mentioned that among critics there is a spoiler code that they dare not break even though some were tempted to on this one because it is so vile why no one had the cojones to step up and say this is garbage and this is why is beyond give your money to these poop-peddlers
what seemed as a good premise for a it fails to deliver on nearly every level very hard to follow at the start of the movie i actually found myself fighting the urge to turn it off the biggest problem from a visual aspect is the fact that the camera work is simply over the top with so many arty splicings and semi-subliminal cuts throughout the movie that actually distracts you from the from the overall story it really tries too hard to immerse you in the moment and build to a suspenseful ending but the movie just has so many half conceived characters and non relevant script it just leaves you feeling disappointed and confused as to why they tried to go so deep with it
this is possibly one of the worst giant killer animal movies i have ever seen it follows the typical premise of a laboratory experiment gone wrong and a giant crocodile with a rapid growth chemical in it escapes the monster looks way to much like a dinosaur having big tyranosaurous-like hind legs when it should just look like an over-sized crocodile everything about this movie is unoriginal and it constantly oozes cliche minute after minute why are there always two drunken redneck hunters out after dark who separate plus always a guy and girl who share a lame obvious love interest while they are in life threatening situations to much has already been said by me and i feel as if i'm wasting my time writing this
i think micheal ironsides acting career must be over if he has to star in this sort of low budge crap surely he could do better than waste his time in this movie could be far better if it had a good budget but it shows repeatedly through-out the movie there is one scene at a outpost which looks like its outside the front of a railway station and i bet it is one scene which made give this movie a and it shows the space craft landing and taking off over a lake surrounded by forests this was well done but the rest of the movie forget is another scene which looks like a engineering plant which i bet it and does not look like a space outpost as the character say it movie is stupid has a serious low budget makes no sense and god help micheal ironsides
this is absolutely the dumbest movie i've ever seen what a waste of a splendid cast james cromwell as the ignoramus playing deputy i could go on and on but i would obviously be spending more time on this review than anybody ever did on the script the only thing this movie is about is us vs them and how to revel in profane slapstick beyond any reasonable human tolerance this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen and i love james garner
i watched this movie when joe bob briggs hosted monstervision on tnt even he couldn't make this movie enjoyable the only reason i watched it until the end is because i teach video production and i wanted to make sure my students never made anything this bad but it took all my intestinal fortitude to sit through it though like watching your great grandmother flirting with a year old boy excruciatingly you took the actual film dipped it in paint thinner then watched it it would be more entertaining you see this movie in the bargin bin at s-mart back away from it as if it were a rattlesnake
the education of little tree is just not as good as it could have been little education is about things like the circle of life and how you should look at a star to help you whatever happened to the three readin ritin and rithmetic when the idiot back talks the teacher at the boarding school place he starts crying and talking to the sky oh my gosh sure the lady was a little harsh but then james character comes and takes him away leaving the audience thinking that little tree was absolutely right he should learn to adapt to new discipline those were the times talking to a star is not going to change a thing little tree needs to learn that his adoring guardians are not always right
i saw this movie in a theater in chicago and should have enjoyed it since i love nemesis but if the first half an hour is skillfully done the rest is just sub-predator video fodder a long chase through those post-modern empty factories pyun affectionnates my girlfriend fell asleep i still like pyun though but not this
despite much style flash and glitter this french musical fails to speak the tunes are repetitive predictable and tedious the story is uninteresting as are the many characters break into song and dance without motivation or reason most of the cast wears phony looking wigs and hairpieces and the sets look hopelessly studio be honest this video of the restored version was stopped before the end so negative an effect it had on me certainly a shame to have such a multi-talented cast in so feeble a final effort to show i guess where followups this case to the great classic umbrellas often do go awry one cannot recapture only recreate
a bad movie it seems like there is only police in hk they were not using there gun and this makes me feel like a jacky movie all the time they were using their gun to point at the suspect only when they finally use their gun is when they kill each other what a funny movie in the movie like all the good guys died without a story line of the movie also sucks the story jump here and there and bored people but if you wanted to see a bloody movie i think this is only a ok type of movie i think made zombie movie is more bloodier than this one
hard to know what was going through per kristensen and morten heads when they wrote gayniggers from outer space the movie is billed as a comedy yet there are no real jokes beside the crude character names b dick sgt shaved balls the rest of the movie is a unintentionally funny affair with ridiculously unsynchronised voice-overs the actors basically reading their lines with no hint of feeling futuristic computer displays filled with spelling mistakes and a plot that makes almost no though of viewers have given this movie a perfect out of this is the complete opposite of what a good film is it may be entertaining to watch with some friends but this film only deserves about a out of higher than the lower possible rating only because of the sheer fact that the writers somehow managed to get some black guys to star in this movie
what a piece of junk this movie was the premise was okay but even in the beginning with crappy effects to blend in a giant with normal sized people the effects in hercules was better i knew this would be bad but the really awful part of the movie is the dialogs completely incoherent silly and stupid i felt like it had been written by some grader in creative class and gotten a i want to slap casper van diem and the other actors for following this movie had my share of cheesy and bad movies love the tremors series but this i do not recommend it at all silly and the totally flabbergastingly bad dialogs will make you cringe
ashley judd in an early role and i think her first starring role shows her real-life rebellious nature in this slow-moving feminist soap opera wow is this a vehicle for political correctness and extreme liberalism or a staunch feminist in real life she must have cherished this script no wonder left wing critic roger ebert loved this movie right up his political alley the reviewers here i am glad judd elevated herself from this moronic fluff to better roles in movies that entertained not preached the heavy-handed liberal agenda
this movie is a mess i'm surprised it even has a theatrical release without robin williams it would have gone straight to video it is poorly written it is poorly directed worse offense is that it has taken an interesting topic and reduced it to a ridiculous and boring thriller that has no thrills and no suspense and no inner or emotional after the first half hour the movie dovetails into a series of ridiculous set pieces that are so over the top that the audience i saw it with was laughing at it save your money the trailer is totally misleading it is not suspenseful and there are no thrills in fact the truly worst offense is that it is simply boring
i've seen a lot of movies and rarely would i ever rate a movie but this movie was beyond acting was terrible the plot was ridiculous the effects were unrealistic and the characters were annoying usually when i watch scary movies i think dumb when the characters hears a noise in and then yells out hello is anyone there but at least they're believable when they do it this movie couldn't even get that is a movie that'll make other b-horror movies like venom and the fog look like academy award winning always have an open mind while watching movies and i can only say that this movie was a complete waste of time and i write this comment so that anyone else thinking of watching this movie will think again awful
poor will would be rolling over in his grave if he could this this horiible german-tv adaptaion of his classic play obvious that very little money was spent on it a stage riser a catwalk and some randomly placed columns pass off as a set the movie was ineptly dubbed into english with the english voice actors occasionally mumbling their lines the whole production had an incredibly dark and dreary feel to it and just where was fonterbras in this movie anyway gave this sorry production the treatment it justly be or not to be i wish this movie never was in the first place
hooper is not funny not fasted paced not romantic and non informative there is no real drama you would think that a movie about the greatest stuntman would have some drama there was an attempt but it didn't seem real no character study no lessons learned it did not even look like the actors were having any real fun they were just trying to act like they were having fun there is no reason to watch unless you like to look at burt and want get an occasional glimpse of sally prancer the horse was beautiful and did what he was supposed to do in fact prancer was the best actor in this movie smoky and the bandit was such a fun movie that i was ready to like hooper this movie turned out to be a real disappointment and waste of time
apparently hollywood is just handing out money to anyone with a camera and the ability to speak this movie was mind numbingly bad the casting was terrible the acting unspeakable and the story filled with holes script who needs script i was surprised that the movie wasn't as verbally vulgar as i thought it would be however i got enough shots of to last me a lifetime the movie was like listening to a year old street racer with add decided to buy a car instead of go to college tell a story being so poorly scripted i thought the two brothers in the film were lovers at first the scenes at the racetrack along with the main female actor in the film kept making me think of herbie fully loaded this is the kind of film is what grindhouse modeled itself the writers thought they were being serious
elizabeth taylor never could act at all and she was just her usual annoying untalented self in this film this was before she got so fat but she still looked very short and dumpy rock hudson was ok as bick benedict but clearly an actor with more range like william holden would have been better james dean certainly proved he knew how to mumble his way through a movie the whole film is incredibly slow and goes on for far too long the actors were all too young and lightweight and none of them aged convincingly due to the poor make-up hudson looked ridiculous just being padded out and dean and carroll baker were obviously the same
what an appalling piece of rubbish who are all these people who blubber on about how good this is yes arty and yes foreign but not enough the plot is boring and disjointed like a reality show but not so slickly people are intrinsically uninteresting but as characters they don't have enough depth to feel empathy for them if they are based on real people then i feel very very sorry for violence some of it is very violent seems quite ostentatious and gratuitous like the producer has visions of being quenton tarantino not that i think very much of him oh yes if i had neighbours like these i'd move
the same old if i can't get the funding for my project i'll inject myself monster movie there is nothing new here a lot like the jeff goldblum fly movie the man manages to keep some semblance of sanity but eventually succumbs to the effects of his experiments the acting is pretty bad there are people acting stupidly all along the way putting their lives in danger for no apparent reason the guy keeps going back to the lab he has been forbidden to enter then his relationship with a young woman and her son admittedly he is good looking but he seems like a lot of trouble just a pretty big waste of time even his tyrannosaurus suit looks like it came off the rack at a star trek convention
i have seen most if not all of the laurel hardy classic films i have always enjoyed there comical stupidly even after watching it over and over again this new film attempts to bring back the classic with two new actors who resemble both laurel hardy however fails miserably for various reasons one of which is how out of place their cloths are early century however are both portrayed in the setting some of the former dialogue was brought back however it also fails miserably to come close to the classic series this film could very well be the worst film i have ever seen and should be pulled off the shelf and locked away forever the real laurel hardy are surly spinning in their graves at such a bad imitation
the sects that capitalise on this film are well known for their claim to take the message of the bible without any alteration or extra-biblical influence the existence of this film is solely due to the fact that there is no such you want to know what the born-again branch of christianity were harping on about in the seventies just look up the word rapture in a dictionary of cults and sects quicker than sitting through this waste of acting uneven sound quality and a script that could just as easily have been written by jack t chick christian conspiracy theorist for those not familiar with the evangelical scene you could not really put this into the so bad good category so its only audience are either those with a pamphlet collection looking to branch out or the extremely paranoid
i'm trying to picture the pitch for dark angel i'm thinking matrix i'm thinking bladerunner i'm thinking that chick that plays faith in angel wearing shiny black leather or some chick just like her leave that one with us only get this we'll do it without any plot dialogue character decent action or budget just some loud bangs and a hot chick in shiny black leather straddling a big throbbing bike fanboys dig loud bangs and hot chicks in shiny black leather straddling big throbbing bikes shallow dreary formulaic passionless tedious dull dumb humourless desultory barely competent live action anime without any action or indeed any life sf just the way joe fanboy likes it in fact
i couldn't believe i spent on this the only redeeming quality is the outrageous gore the dubbing was worse than any i have ever experienced it looks like it was shot with a vhs camcorder i think every pfennig was spent on the special effects because there was a whole lot of blood and body parts everywhere its one of the worst movies i have ever seen but i do have to acknowledge the plentiful gore that wasn't as disgusting as it could have been because the whole movie is so silly and unbelievable
like a bad tv show got loose and tried to become a soft-core porn movie oh my god was it bad the plots of each character had little relevance the plot itself wasn't anything to speak of something about a stalker i guess in the end he shoots himself not really clear but somehow a volleyball game involved and the main character sleeps around a lot the only reason my friends rented this movie was because casper van dien was in it and they ended up wanting to fast forward to the scenes with him in it which were barely watchable at that thank god i didn't spend any money on it but i want that hour of my life back
and i have seen some bad have nothing good to say about this movie the acting is poor by jennifer tilly as to be expected daryl hannah does an ok job but nothing close to being able to save this biggest flaw in this film is that the plot is so weak though based on a good premise that the writer resorted to the stupid heroine trick to create a contrived suspense when all daryl hannah would have to do is hide she runs out in front of her pursuer the hospital scene is absurd without exposing too much of what passes for a plot i think it would be difficult for a bloody petite woman to carry a pregnant from a hospital without being noticed lame very yourself some time and pick out another flick
hi about that movie john c should be ashamed that he appears as executive producer in the credits bon jovi has never been and will never be an actor and the fx are a first vampires was good and it was the only vampires this thing here just wears the same a waste of time thinks scorpio
this movie is a joke i mean a ha ha funny joke why because the only redeeming thing about it was the good laugh i got at the sheer ridiculousness of nonsensical inane plot and horrible acting this movie there are so many unanswered questions for example why do these women become zombies and how why are there four black women who are caretakers and what is their purpose since when does people make up a nation of zombies and is smeared black eye mascara scary to anyone anywhere even a year lastly why was this movie made at all why why why no answer what i the demand channel they actually issued this comment after the synopsis of the movie we apologize for this movie in advance lol at least they had the decency to do this much
just below the surface lies what a simply awful movie is other viewers have justifiably commented the storm sequences are just plain ridiculous chopping already sodden firewood in the pouring rain now smart menace foreboding sexual tension for those read dull contrived dull contrived and dull overly want to say thank god for mia shower scene but in retrospect i think the producers of the film having seen the completed mess realised that they had to put something in to make it half way worthwhile at all so it just becomes yet another contrivance do yourself a favour and give this a miss
ok i will sum up this movie a bunch of skanky british women have some disease that basically is turning them into zombies the whole movie consists of these women talking smoking and rarely going out for meat or humans to eat i swear i had to make myself watch this movie ugh
the minute the forward started i knew we were in for trouble the premise is laughable at best the story line was even worse if that is acting was stiff and the actors gave off a sense of inexperience you expect more from the likes of slater reid and dorff lines were delivered as if from a robot and i'm sorry i like reid but she was very unbelievable as an archaeologist slater and dorff picked a lousy film to try and stage their comebacks continuity was off through out the entire film the creatures weren't bad but they really weren't good either line i want that ninety minutes of my life back they can keep the money but give me the time what a waste
this movie looks like it was made for tv for years i waited for some movie to be made about rubin carter because i loved to see him box at the old msg and to see this movie was very have alot of respect for mr washington but he was awful and is really nothing good to say about this movie except i did like the song
i actually went to see this film in a theater but what a complete waste of time and money bad acting i'm sorry to say did not help to enjoy this rather sticky friends told me to go and see this film since james redfield the author of the book was very heavily involved in the screenplay they had really enjoyed the book so the movie just had to be perfect well maybe i had my hopes up a bit too high but i absolutely hated this movie it was predictable too sweetish to a point that i actually left i had to vomit and worst of all there is going to be a sequel do the world a favor and stop this abominable crusade
this is the worst documentary to come out of canada ever i'm glad to see the guys haven't made another movie all they want to do is get a movie made and it doesn't have to be the one they wrote they keep changing the script to suite the person they're pitching i could not get out of the theatre fast enough when i saw it at that toronto film festival please never see this film
good performances can't save this terrible script larded with every cliche in the chick-flick book both main characters are deeply unsympathetic and the scene where laura character reminisces about sex with her dead husband in front of her teenage son which i think is supposed to be poignant is just horrifying
this is a japanese film but there is quite a bit of english also spoken in here a pretty film with nice visuals featuring the scenic beauty of that was the only redeeming quality for me the story was generally boring who wants to watch a young woman sulk for percent of the film because her picture husband is a lot older than he advertised he was granted that could be a get over in the last minutes does she do an about-face and become fond of him by then for most viewers it was too little-too late we'd fallen asleep by then
i wish i had my rental money back from this piece of trash so i could donate it to the home for aged actors total rubbish five people watched this movie at the same time and there wasn't one single laugh to be heard lots of yawning though a beautiful woman and she was the best thing to look at in the entire so-called comedic movie
i have seen it not good but interesting in an understated way the boys in it are quite naturalistic final gang rape scene is repugnant and the arbitrary insertion of second world war footage is offensive in the way it attempts to compare real horror with this misogynistic contrivance real atrocity is this film is just atrocious however the film has a look which can draw you in but it seems to me that is the new clothes but in fact in reverse the film looks good but the direction story content and final feeling you take away from this film is vacuous if a feeling can be vacuous-this is it
i realize not supposed to be bsg and i can handle slow-paced shows if they're interesting but i find myself completely uninterested and bored with this formula for bsg seemed to be action adventure scifi suspense mystery formula for caprica seems to be bland drama moderate it will get more interesting but as of episode i can barely watch it in fact at the bottom of my to-watch list for the week this is a sad state of affairs the syfi channel really destroyed their friday night lineup whatever happened to the glory days of stargate atlantis and bsg on friday nights they had a good thing there
mario lewis of the competitive enterprise institute has written a definitive point-by-point line-by-line refutation of this mendacious film which should be titled a convenient lie the website address where his debunking report which is titled a guide to an inconvenient truth can be found at is a shorter version can be found at once you read those demolitions you'll realize that alleged global warming is no more real or dangerous than the scare of which gore also endorsed as he did the pseudo-scientific film the day after tomorrow which was based on a book written by alleged ufo abductee whitley strieber as james the amazing randi does to psychics and philip klass does to ufos and gerald posner does to jfk conspir-idiocy theories so does mario lewis does to al movie and the whole global warming scam
oh dear oh dear i started watching this not knowing what to expect i couldn't believe what i was seeing there were times when i thought it was a comedy i loved how the plan to capture the terrorist leader is to air drop in one man who is unarmed and expect him to capture him and escape with a rocket pack if only it were really that easy i've finally found a movie worse than plan from outer space
this is only the second time i stopped a part way was willing to give this film the benefit of the doubt at first even though it managed to be both shallow clich√©d and stupid and joyless plodding and was like an after school special directed by that weird grade nine kid who thinks nobody understands him creepy and sad with voice-over narration that only the most deluded adolescent would consider poetry and some singing and no really the poor already especially when it morphed into a brazen clumsy and insulting clockwork orange ripoff and did i mention the isn't the worst film i've ever seen but certainly the one i've felt least compelled to sit through i don't recommend it to anyone
this is probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen everything about it is weak and incoherent the acting is absurd the costumes even crummier and the story is non-existent this poverty row sword and adventure film was meant to capture some of the success that beastmaster and conan enjoyed but it doesn't give us any reason to follow along the lead character is tepid and dull he can't even fight with a sword and the sword is from the century all the action sequences are like that slow and unrealistic not to mention the castle and the horribly dated music playing whenever they are riding a horse don't even bother with this crap
positively awful george sanders vehicle where he goes from being a thief to police sanders was an excellent character actor he was certainly no leading man and this film proves is absolutely beyond stupidity gene lockhart did provide some comic relief until a moment of anger led him to fire his gun with tragedy george sanders and co-star carol landis committed suicide in real life after making a film as deplorable as this it is not usual appealing signe hasso is really nothing here
this movie could have been so much better with a script rewrite not that i expect a great deal of plausibility in movies but you'd think that even the homeless and urban-dwelling jack mason would question why a group of experienced hunters would want to hire him as a hunting guide and upon reaching the hunting grounds poor ice-t plays his part as if he is actually going to lead these men through woods never seen how does jack mason find thomas burns back in assuming this movie was based on richard short story the most dangerous game a few years ago i showed this movie to a class of grade students after they read the story i reedited the movie cutting out all the pointless scenes and all the profanity it ended up being minutes long
not a terrible movie really and glenn and keitel are top-notch actors further they do an acceptable job with the very weak script the scenery is lush and the plot has some interesting twists further i umderstand why these actors and the crew made the film they are professionals and they get paid for it but i do wonder why studios spend the time and money to make a film and then don't release it for theater audiences even if a film is a box-office flop surely it makes some money if you are a fan of keitel or glenn rent the video or catch it on tv as did i granted the movie won't help solve the immigration quandary with mexico but the experience is far better than of the standard tv fare of today
look nothing spectacularly offensive about this film just boring a typical rom-com with an ending you can see coming before you've seen so much as the trailer the key difference is that the classic rom-coms tackle their stories with wit and a lack of pretension this movie has no pretension but it really has no sense of movement you feel as though you could get up and walk away at any moment the production of the movie also has the feel of a debut movie made about fifteen years ago i'd recommend re-watching a classic movie like when harry met sally instead of this shallow imitation oh one other big chemistry if you're used to seeing michael looking all cute as vaughn in alias you're going to be seriously disappointed with the way they've made him look here
eyes of the werewolf is a really bad movie the premise was real good but the overall execution was just terrible i wished the filmmakers would have taken their time with this project instead of rushing it into production some blind dude gets some new eyes bad thing is that they belong to a mean old werewolf nasty things begins to happen to the dude as he turns into a cheesy looking creature can he find a cure before his hot girlfriend finds out who is that weird little troll who helps him out and up with that female cop if you really want to find out check out eyes of the a bad idea for a movie i just wished the filmmakers would have spent a lot for time in pre-production before they decided to shoot the movie
this movie was horrible i could barely stay awake through it i would never see this movie again if i were payed to the so-called horror scenes in it were increadably predictable and over played there was really nothing about this movie that would have made it original or worth the i payed to see it don't go see it don't rent it don't read about it online because any of these things would be a complete waste of your time sarah michelle geller gave a lackluster performance and really should be ashamed of herself for sullying her good name with this movie shame on you sarah for being associated with this horrible horrible movie horrible movie no need to ever see it
it gets really bad the only half-way redeeming quality is the effects from the thousands of bullets used during the film there are context errors everywhere the acting is horrible save kirk the story is as holey as the grail and the belief that the movie is a video game in itself just kills the movie if it wasn't already a corpse so all in all a waste of your life i would have given this a zero had that been an option on the rating scale
my boyfriend and i rented this because we thought it might be a good halloween take-off a killer terrorizing young people a white get my drift we were dead wrong no pun intended we not only discovered one of the worst movies out there but also that it is a cult classic it is filled holes and makes no sense the actress who plays maddy is pretty but about it i do give credit for it being shot on a very low always support movies like that just not this particular movie may be good to see if you're drunk or high otherwise don't bother unless you want to lose your movie privileges like i did
this is the worst movie i have seen for years it starts ridicoulus and continues in the same way i thnik when is something going to happen in this film and the the acting is worse the ending lifts it a bit and saves the movie from a total flop mark wahlberg is a bad actor in a bad movie sorry tim burton batman was good but this one sucks
this was the worst film i have seen for a long time only that it has nearly nothing to do with the other american pie movies the story is obvious flat and absolutely not funny girls are nice though but spending your time watching a cheap soft porno would possibly be greater than watching this film seems to be a very bad made sex ad made for an audience that is not older than never visited an american college but i would seriously doubt that anyone who did could really laugh about any of the your time do something else
bela lugosi revels in his role as european horticulturalist dr lorenz in this outlandish tale of horror and dementia the good aging wife needs fluids harvested from the glands of young virgins in order to retain her youth and beauty what better place for the doctor to maintain his supply than at the alter where he kidnaps the unsuspecting brides before they can complete their vows sedating them into a coma-like state he brings them to his mansion to collect his tainted bounty according to the dvd synopsis that brief description is much more entertaining and imaginative than the the corpse vanishes wallace fox bela lugosi luana walters elizabeth russell
would have better strengthened considerably by making it as minute episode of the outer limits too much superfluous material and stuff like the chief bad guy looking like he'd escaped from the phantom of the opera didn't help the whole night of the living dead sequence was extremely silly and quite unnecessary after all if the dead were to punish anyone for their sins now remind me exactly who was killing everyone again
man was i adam arkin is more whiny than ross geller from friends a great cast is wasted mars alan arkin ed mcmahon pat morita louis nye with this amateurish the movie suffers from horrible pacing it jumps around through in a jumbled confusing the story doesn't even make sense why does he want to break the football streak what about the stupid violin music none of it is not even funny like a bunch of accountants trying to do improv saying lookit me lookit me i'm being funny this was a bad attempt at making another love at first like larry cohen movies but man he failed here i couldn't wait for the credits to roll horribly disappointed
if you see this turkey listed in your tv guide avoid it like the steaming great pile of fetid dingoes kidneys doesn't begin to describe how bad this movie is there is only one funny scene memory eraser scene but even that rates only on the laughometer of whoever wrote this turkey should be banned from writing another movie for their entire lives
not to be confused with the madonna film the next best thing the last big thing is a silly campy off-the-wall comedy about a man who yearns to start a magazine called the next big thing which reviews a variety of up and coming artists this low budget indie makes chuck and buck look like a masterpiece fraught with lousy acting poor sets and costuming etc thing has earned some awful reviews and to date has only been nominated for one fringe award pass on this one
i thought intensive care was quite bad and very unintentionally funny but at least not as bad as i thought it might be sometimes somewhat suspenseful but never a good fun lies in ridiculous moments but the all-time classic moment is this peter wauters is stabbed and beaten by the killer he lies moaning in the corner of the hallway amy van nie kneels beside him and asks poor peter shall i get you a movie was shot in dutch and english to spare costs all license plates are usa and the background in the news studio is a skyline of manhattan very funny if you're dutch and watching the original version in dutch
mimicking its long title the movie finds ways to come close to the mark the beautiful sets are here with all that made the hamer production values a trademark yet paris drowned in the fog is a sign of indolent neglect the story is obvious and can be summed up in a dozen words so there comes nothing unexpected and nothing worth more than of your attention to be directing is heavy as a direct transfer from the stage play actors are mostly stiff as wax figures this is a hamer feature only sometimes better featured in the whole package my conclusion this movie is trash not worth the time i spend that evening eternal life is a boring matter and i should have hoped the guys in charge of programming at the cinemath√®que would have known better
okay i absolutely love ben stiller although i am lukewarm about jennifer aniston i do not think this girl can act in the least every movie or sitcom i've seen her in is very hard to get past her fake acting it sounds like she is just standing there reading right off the script this movie only had one good thing about it and that ben stiller was in it this plot is so used and abused ridiculous how many movies have this same type of plot can we say forces of nature not only is the plot so old but the outcome is so predictable boring i knew everything that was going to happen before it did it was a bore but watching stiller is always a delight
i read john story years ago in digest and i remember thinking what a great movie it would make and it probably would have been had michael landon never got his hands on it as far as i'm concerned landon was one of the worst actors on earth and his artistic license went way over the top similar to his massacre of the little house book series is proof the acting for lack of a better word is atrocious the screenplay sloppy and there are more close-ups of puss than should be movie reflects story as much as little house on the prairie reflects the books is was based on just another vehicle to show off landons horrendous hair
this movie is horrible everything in it has been done before there is nothing original i cannot stand when writers don't come up with their own girl makes a wish on her birthday and wakes up as an adult hmm sounds a lot like a movie in the called big what is even more annoying is jennifer acting she doesn't act like she is she just acts like she is then on you can guess the whole plot she gets a good job and it just so happens that a friend she had at works with her wow how awesome but friend is bad and turns on her trying to get her job but of course she wins in the end when she comes up with a great also a dancing scene in the movie that i've seen a thousand times hate this movie
an obvious b-grade effort to cash in on the buzz my expectations for this film were low low and yet it still managed to disappoint on every level the acting is so bad not even funny the plot-line is non-existent and the only scare was realizing that i had wasted minutes watching it i'm surprised to note that people gave it a star rating i can only suspect that of these are cast and crew the is possibly the directors mother although i'm sure even she would find it hard to go higher than a dvd extras include an hour long making of feature which raises the question why perhaps it serves to demonstrate what not to do avoid at all costs
i don't really know where to start the acting in this movie was really terrible i can't remember seeing so many actors in one film that weren't able to act not only the acting was bad the characters were incredibly stupid as the action i believe that even children know that when someone gets shot blood involved but when someone gets shot in snitch'd for ten times no blood at all well i guess just make a long story short believe me i can go on for hours about this film this is without a doubt the worst film i ever saw this film should be number in the bottom without a doubt
having seen versus previously i had high hopes for alive the description of the movie on the back of the dvd jacket sounded promising alive did not deliver very slow development loads of potential with the cast and the cool visuals the premise was intriguing but the payoff did not offset the build up could have done so much more at the end most of the movie is just sitting around to put it plainly three of us were amped to sit down and watch this movie and by the minute mark we were struggling to make it thru to the end it really needed more shock elements if you are looking for ichi the killer or versus type fights then save yourself some and loads of disappointment
aside for hollywood veterans wayan brothers were asked thats what hollyweird demanded and thats what it got however like so many of its recent decisions this one was a stupendous director is so out of touch with todays audience attempting to bring back physical pratfalls and gags in place of funny dialogue is just a disaster i knew it the audience knew it and the cast knew a shame why did they ever consider changing directors not only that but the two wayan brothers played as two of four primary characters without them its just a farce and a sad
well this movie is amazingly awful i felt sorry for the actors involved in this project because i'm sure they did not write their lines which were sometimes delivered with slight sarcasm which lead me to believe they were not taking this movie seriously nor could anybody who watches this obnoxious off beat monster slasher while watching this creature unknown i could not help but think that there was not much of a budget or a competent writer on the crew but if you go into watching this for a laugh you'll be happy the movie is shameless to mocking itself because i cant see how anybody could look at this and be proud of pumping this straight to dvd clich√©d wanna be action movie fightfest to light
how can this movie have a this movie was a piece of skunk first the actors were really bad i mean chainsaw charlie was so retarded because in the very beginning when he pokes his head into the wooden hut happened to be about oh quarter of an inch thick really cheap flimsy piece of wood and he did not even think he could cut threw the person who did the set sucks at supplying things for them to build with the only good thing about this movie is the idea of this show bottom line do not waste your hard earned cash on this hunk of they call a
it is like what the title of this thread say only impression i got from that movie is that marlee character was always angry so cynical and so pathetic her first date with william character where they were dancing were dumb all in all i've tried to finish watching the movie four times and of all four times i fell asleep i would keep watching that movie with one intention to beat my problem with insomnia because all it do is to put me to sleep sweet dream
oh wait i can this movie is not for the typical film snob unless you want to brush up on your typical cinematic definitions like continuity editing and geographic match i couldn't tell where i was in this movie one second they're in the present next minute their supposedly in the driving a modern suv and wearing what looked like to me as style clothing i think i couldn't pay long enough attention to it since the acting was just horrible i think it only got attention because it has a which i did not watch if you're a b-movie buff and by b-movie i mean bad movie then this film is for you home-movie and all non-sense style will keep you laughing for as long as you can stay awake if your tastes are more for goddard and antonioni though just skip this one
like what other dracula movies always do the minions of dracula always on side which is what disappointed me at the ending regardless the person wants to stay a vampire or not i would like to see something like in the first movie that the minion fights against her master it is much interesting you can almost predict how the story goes than just either the priest or d win the game need some surprising plots
oh dear some of the best talent in british tv made this serial and so i can only assume that they were working under incredible time pressure and had to settle for first takes of many are some frightening scenes in this highland mystery when the monster attacks and we see it from his point of view but i'm afraid that i found most of the story unintentionally funny such as the moment when the hero discovers a dismembered corpse on a golf course oh look a hand oh and another hand over there hmm this is a bit puzzling many years fans of british cult tv shows campaigned to have this serial released on vhs or dvd but the bbc always said no now i think i understand why
his first movie after longtime friend john death aykroyd shows much fatigue trying to pull off a character that would have been a snap for doctor detroit gives us bookish professor aykroyd masquerading as a weird violent pimp to ward off a rival known only as mom bad enough but he also has classes to teach a school dinner to host four ladies of the evening to protect and a dinner something like that to attend no wonder aykroyd seems stupefied most of the time why should the viewer be was on this film that aykroyd met future wife donna dixon at least some good came out of this chaotic and a half stars you want good aykroyd see the blues brothers you want bad see doctor detroit
way back when i was renting videos for free i picked this one up oops the things i wanted to mention outside the summary already given were these someone who had a lot to do with making this movie had a strange and sick fascination for food it was gross and unecessary there is some kind of a soundtrack in the background of the film that seems to be there the entire time and by the way i felt for days after viewing this trash i figure they had something subliminal going on in the track either that or it was just traumatisingly bad or both many times throughout the movie you can tell the writer and director did not have much experience or talent and don't even ask about the acting
if you have read the book do not set your hopes high if you have not go read it and never watch the film it is strange to learn that toby young was actually involved a lot in the writing of the script he claims himself in the post script of the book because the film is very different from the the film seems to be aiming at taking a rather thought provoking and entertaining piece that combines philosophical ideas with plain funny sarcasm and simplifying it so that everyone would understand it it achieves with perfection the film is full of bad and cheap jokes suitable for a sitcoms and has lost any meaningful message that it could have are better off not seeing it
cedric films have been character-based rather than action-based thinking of l'ennui and feux rouges so it is jarring to see this series of really expert car chases interspersed with some plodding attempts to give character to succo i don't find stefano cassetti to be an interesting actor he reminds me of pro athletes who are coaxed into movies like bret favre that blank stare looks like a really vicious deer caught in the headlights a real actor would have forced us to reflect more on personality rather than admiring his skill at little acting there is comes mainly from isild le besco as the needy schoolgirl succo takes by storm the interview at the police office is a marvel of bland obstinacy with a little fear of the future blended in le besco apart there is little to recommend this film
this film was horrible the script is completely unrealistic yet it is written to take place in the real-world the editing and lighting effects are worse than most first projects in film do not recommend this film to anyone who a knows any detail about the world of police or covert operations b knows any detail about film making or do recommend this film to the average or below-average mind i think it would be enjoyable if i was a dumber if you must watch this film on a full mind i highly recommend some kind of is a total waste of what little production value it has
the fluffer may have strong elements of porn industry truth to it but that doesn't make up for the fact that pretty shabbily directed and acted and with a very mediocre grade from start to the exceedingly drawn out would be embarassing to think of the general public being offered this piece as an example of state of the art gay film it has a limited life in the gay film festival circuit and is allowed to die a natural death on film will open the queer film weekend in brisbane on april i think its success there will be strongly influenced by the amount of alcohol consumed in the preceding cocktail party they're gonna need it
this is not just a bad film one of the worst films ever so bad that i found it to be quite enjoyable the acting oh my god the script you gotta be kiddin how can you imagine the writer coming up with things like a kid who makes fireworks in school fireworks so powerfull that when someone gets hit by it they fly a hundred yards backwards and explode girl is trapped in the celler the killer is trying to break open the door she gets a drill but the wire isn't long enough she first makes an extension cord oh the horror and then when done she drills through the door and drills through the head of the killer wow and there are plenty more examples like that oh yeah and what happened to george kennedy he used to be great and hand luke
i rented this movie today thinking it might be a good football movie since i'm a big football fan boy was i wrong this movie is way too religious and preachy and is really unrealistic this movie pretty much says that if your a christian you can get anything you want in life easily like become a great football player you don't become a great football player by becoming christian and asking god you do it through practice and hard work all you gotta do is ask god and he'll give you thats not true at all duh i laughed several times because of this embarrassment the only part that was funny was when they were being dumb the cartoonist no the dude that flew over the atlantic etc etc but really this movie wasn't that great i don't recommend it especially if you aren't a christian lol
my wife and i both agree that this is one of the worst movies ever made certainly in the top ten of those i've watched all the way through at least plan was did really enjoy christine the dead zone firestarter carrie and some of his other films i didn't care much for cujo because the sound was so bad on versions i've seen and i often couldn't tell what people were saying or pet sematary this mess was a total mistake in every way possible the creatures themselves seemed designed by a offense to the one-liners made us groan and weren't remotely amusing
bathebo you big is the worst piece of crap i've seen in a long time i have just stumbled onto it on late night tv and it is painful to watch really painful how does something like this get made horrible horrible horrible oooooo the toilet is flushing by itself again scary toilet scary toilet scary toilet doesn't seem like that long ago to me but watching this makes it seem like i mean its horrible please don't waste your time on the old black man telling them not to build the pool in the yard scary scary how does this stuff get made
this would be a watchable hollywood mediocre if it had a good editing it relies on the typical american thriller plot who is going to outsmart everyone acting is below average but with shining appearance of the detective who is the best actor in the film and he is mostly responsible if the tension in the film rises film was completely suffocated by blank video and sound shots and most of it looks like raw film material all in all if you don't mind watching a movie that looks like a student film project this is a film to watch i guess that would be enough to say on this film everything else could really spoil the tension that is probably low enough
i'm not quite sure why but this movie just doesn't play the way it should it should be humerous and fun but instead is just boring i think a large part of it is because they way over played the gadgets the old cartoon it is based on is much
st fire has no bearing on life after university at all the majority of us common folk anyway why was this garbage even made who can really relate to this who lives like these characters i truly feel sorry for the actors having to deal with such a terrible script there are some talented young actors in this film that have done a good job elsewhere it must have just been one whole joke to them on actually found this film insulting to my intelligence the only joy i got from this is hoping that sir john hughes had a good ol laugh when he saw a screening of this the same year his masterpiece of the breakfast club was make the same mistake i did of watching this because you enjoy films it really is that offensive to the genre
the american humane association which is the source of the familiar disclaimer no animals were harmed registered trademark of the aha began to monitor the use of animals in film production more than years ago after a blindfolded horse was forced to leap to its death from the top of a cliff for a shot in the film jesse james needless to say the atrocious act kills the whole entertainment aspect of this film for me i suppose one could say that at least the horse didn't die in vain since it was the beginning of the public waking up to the callous and horrendous pain caused animals for the glory of movie making but i can't help but feel that if the poor animal had a choice this sure wouldn't have been the path he would have taken
two kinds of movies we like are westerns and movies from or years ago we ought to have liked a man called sledge this picture is disagreeable annoying and stupid from start to finish since there is nobody in the story or bad to warm up to there is nobody to motivate the necessary suspense to keep the viewer interested no camaraderie among the guys trying to steal the gold and no camaraderie among those trying to protect it sledge has a pretty girl friend but no reason why she slobbers all over the guy or why she wants to be in the same room with this no-account film also suffers from an intrusive and gawdawful musical score and from extremely bad writing and direction by vic the last older movies rented from netflix or video vault this was the rock bottom the only true dud in the bunch
there are some stallone movies i like but this movie didn't meet my low expectations i found this movie hard to believe for example a bunch of terrorists who crash land in the wilderness are prepared to survive for at least two days also in all this wilderness stallone and company keep running across bridges and ladders that provide convenient short-cuts or plot devices also the treasury cops don't seem to coordinate anything with the local rescue people also bad guys who couldn't hit the side of a barn with really high-tech looking automatic liked john villain initially but the character is such a complete psychopath that he doesn't care at all about any of his own bad guys or all of them getting killed eventually i just couldn't believe the character worth the price of a rental not even worth taking the time to watch
i read some comments on the internet about this film like harder then hostel the camera never screens of when getting really brutal but none of them is true the camera never screens of because there is nothing to screen of the same scene is repeated hundred and hundred times again women lies on a table killer rapes women a few times killer cuts women into pieces never see this during the whole film police come and arrested him killer fools the jury film over in germany we would say viel l√§rm um nichts all in all one of the most boring films i ever see absolutely non-recommendable
this movie was bizarre completely inexplicable and hysterical to watch with friends while drinking in a big empty house i really love the opening stuff with lisa wandering about lost in a gorgeous city i want to be a beautiful stranger lost in some exotic european locale though maybe not in a low budget horror flick definitely get the ending where there are the strangely non-sexual sex scenes that were cut out my dvd copy anyway don't attempt to understand it just go along and watch out for the weird is everything don't watch this if you actually want plot or characterization or anything at all to make sense pretty beautiful though you may just give up on this and decide to watch an actual horror movie like say dead alive
this was a fairly creepy movie i found the music to be effective for this the photographs mario took of the village were also unnerving however i had three problems with this film one is that the lighting was very dark so some of the time it was hard to tell what was going on but this may have just been my copy the second is that the very beginning is not explained very well and i'm still not sure what was going on there the third problem is that i didn't understand the ending but apparently some people do of course there are also the usual problems of people doing stupid things and the male lead is very all in all watchable but not even close to being a favorite
it is so rare that i get to rate a movie without having some reservation as to whether i should have gone up one or down one but this the explosion rate a notch higher or one down because my brain hurt trying to create a plot no this a solid no
i often feel like scrooge slamming movies that others are raving about or i write the review to balance unwarranted raves i found this movie almost unwatchable and unusual for me was fast-forwarding not only through dull clich√©d dialog but even dull clich√©d musical numbers whatever originality exists in this film unusual domestic setting for a musical lots of fantasy some animation is more than offset by a script that has not an ounce of wit or thought-provoking plot development individually june haver and dan dailey appear to be nice people but can't carry a movie as a team neither is really charismatic or has much sex appeal they're both bland i like billy gray but his character is pretty one-note the best part of the film to me are june beautiful costumes and great body
this was quite possibly the worst film i've ever seen the plot didn't make a whole lot of sense and the acting was awful i'm a big fan of amber benson i think usually a wonderful actress i can't imagine why she decided to do this film her character piper is drunk for almost the whole film with the exception of the opening scene on the plus side there was several points in the film where the acting was so bad i actually laughed out loud but despite that i would not recommend this film to anyone only minutes long but minutes of your life that you will have completely wasted
this is possibly the worst fencing sword-fighting movie ever made that is not just because the so called sports fencing is poor but because the plot characters are so weak that they've got to throw in a semi nude sex scene and later supposed group dancing around a fencing scene in the fencing club trying i suppose to maintain audience interest what a waste of f murray talents you're better served with overblown swashbuckling movies like zorro scaramouche anything that has basil rathbone as the villain as a fencer myself i recognize the near impossibility of capturing fencing as a sport on film but if it ever happens got to have fresher better drawn characters and a plot with more depth
the second coming of suzanne is yet another one of those surrealistic films that tries to come across as extremely sophisticated yet all it does is put the viewer to sleep like other movies of this type there is limited dialogue everyone is much more interested in the visual aesthetic of the shot however the cinematography stinks so there is nothing at all to keep your video box states that this film is one of the most exciting visual adventures ever seen on film right up there with watching such stimulating events as a bucket of ice melting or a turtle walking for a mile
i hated this crap every friday as part of tgif it was on and consistently sucked big time with stupidity each and every week if you want to see something funny go watch no on would tell starring candice cameron and fred savage it really is hilarious shows exactly why no one ever goes on to a good film career after doing a terrible tv show this show really makes me sick i hate those kids and bob saget needs to go jump off a bridge for ever making this crapfest i've seen funner stuff everywhere else but here i ahet writing lines watch full house to see the least humanity has to offer in the way of arts and entertainment
julia stiles is a talented young actress who with guidance from a reputable agent has a lot of potential obviously the person who guided her into this travesty is not someone who cares anything about her career i sat in the theater surrounded by teenagers who left in droves to find another movie to sneak into wondering who thought this movie would appeal to anyone it was poorly written the casting director could only have put or minutes of effort into the characters and the director obviously didn't care
when i look for new cars i expect not to be shown boats when i drink fountain coke i should expect that the drink contains coke when i watch a movie that embellishes itself with the name of en excellent scientist i expect that it is in some way relevant to that person or their work this could have been people discussing my grannys diary the material covered is relevant only in that they vaguely tirade science i fell asleep the first time i tried to watch it the second time i stopped watching love science documentaries i would rather watch them over the latest blockbuster however this falls far short of providing anything worth your time avoid at all costs
this waste of time is a completely unnecessary remake of a great film nothing new or original is added other than backflashes which are of marginal interest it lacks the documentary feel of the first film and the raw urgency that made it so effective also painfully missing is the sharp quincy jones soundtrack that added to much to the original film i can't understand any high ratings for this at all quite bad why does anyone waste time or money making crap like this and why did i waste time watching it
fairly good movie but not a true hurricane carter was a notorius liar a murder and was never found not guilty new jersey state just didn't go for it a third time as years had gone carter got an offer in pass a lie test and go free he didn't take it this film should never have been made but money talks a lot of people have unjustly spend their lives in prison and undoubtedly more blacks than white why choose a fake
the movie starts out with some scrolling text which takes nearly five minutes it gives the basic summary of what is going on this could have easily been done with acting but instead you get a scrolling text effect soon after you are bombarded with characters that you learn a little about keep in mind this is all you will learn about them the plot starts to get off the ground and then crashes through the entire movie not only does the plot change but you might even ask yourself if your watching the same movie i have never played the video game but know people who have from my understanding whether you've played the game or not this movie does not get any better save your money unless you like to sleep at the theaters
a warning to you not to be seduced by the names bigelow and red is pointless and unengaging and made me think often of a phrase by twain about wishing all the characters would be drowned together when someone brings up the category of worst films ever made not the likes of or of the killer that i think of the likes of this what a complete waste of own and everyone who was involved with this flick
i will give it a just because it showed history that we need to know about to prevent it from happening again i agree with the comments from the gentleman from uk the movie was pretty terrible all clich√© no real plot historical and technical inaccuracies abound look up the technical specs on de or any everts class destroyer escort and you will see what i mean i now its black history month in the us and im going to be called a racist just for saying this but the history of this ship is not that great they did some escort work chased a submarine that turned out to be a hulk that they rammed sorry but black people did a lot more in wwii then this silly movie gives them credit for this movie makes them look like whiners let the name calling commence i can handle it
i'm sorry but this is just plain pathetic the little girl was a brat their were no enjoyable characters and the plot sucked besides it wasn't even a gator as the film would like us to believe if you check out any complete guide to reptiles you will find that it really is a crocodile not a gator obviously they didn't hire a real animal expert or they would know that the creature is a croc it is a sad excuse for a movie especially the ending i nearly fell asleep with this one
i'll be blunt and to the point this film is not good at all the film buff part of me hated the acting script story direction and almost all of the editing amanda peet has proven that she can act as she was a high point of the whole nine yards so she should have avoided this movie with a ten foot pole however the infantile part of me found this film to be very funny if you can forget about how underpar the production quality is and if you find smut jokes funny then you should be all right and for those of you who can't get off your pedestal thats your choice my inner child hasen't died and i laughed a fair bit even then only a out of ten because as a movie it really does stink
this is a rather dull movie about a scientist that creates a device and gets horribly disfigured when he uses the machine to transport himself simple plot done before in the fly and others not only does he get disfigured but he also can electrocute people with a touch what is really dumb about this film is that we are expected to believe the place this guy works is against him he could probably make millions for the institution that he is working at but the head of the institution tries to sabotage his every step of the way in the end the projected man electrocutes three people for no reason then goes after those that have wronged him
muscular man-ape in the jungles of africa is hunted by an opportunistic expedition team the comely daughter of the leader finds him first much-ballyhooed version of the tarzan tale has an ok production but is crippled by the single-handedly worst direction of a film i have ever seen john derek is bereft of inspiration beyond cheesy slow-motion action shots and peek-a-boo glimpses of wife bo unclothed body he has about as much talent behind the camera as ed wood trying for tongue-in-cheek sexuality the dereks lack finesse snappy timing and taste they have a sense of self-parody and bravura abandonment do throw caution to the winds but after a promising opening it all goes to hell miles o'keeffe possibly had marbles in his mouth the entire time has the title role but plays third fiddle to john ego and bo sense of self-importance from
from the decrepit ranks of the already over-saturated hillybilly horror sub-genre comes this woeful tale of a vacationing family terrorized by inbred rednecks sound familiar well it most definitely should to anyone with even a cursory knowledge of the horror genre there is absolutely new here the film seems content to recycle all thee old worn out clich√©s hicks a peaceful family turned gun-toting killers when push comes to show the rebellious daughter the one freak good at heart etcetera but does even that half-heartedly enough to make this an utter waste of time this is forgettable dreck but humorously enough lead hart once starred in a movie called films that suck earlier in his career quite an ironic omen grade
if you look at corey information here on imdb apparently a movie called reload in production of june in which playing a character named sebastian of all how does such a crappy movie ever earn a sequel and second didn't sebastian get killed at the end of watched this in the wee hours of the morning when i was battling insomnia and so i was drifting in and out while it was on i'm sure i missed some plot points but overall it seemed really weak performance was me one of the stronger parts of the film i'm also a bit surprised at all the people commenting on the beautiful girls since i thought the actress playing brooke was pretty but not exceptional
jack character tim dingman the dreamer in envy finds wealth and success in the idea of a aerosol spray vapoorize that when sprayed on doggie dung makes the poo disappear into thin air a moment i was hoping that vapoorize was a real product so that i could spray it on this stinker of a movie and make it disappear into thin air as envy is not the worst movie that i have seen in the past months honor goes to the cat in the hat it does get the honor of a close funny not sad not anything a real out of
power rangers the completely awful show from the still continues to disturb young children with complete cheesiness and awful show was not entertainment it was an excuse to teach children violence in showing kids how to fight one another in order to solve their toys were further demonstration in how to promote a violent television show and have never been able to figure out what the purpose of this completely ridiculous show ever such it remains one of the worst kids shows ever made
this movie basks too much in its own innocence it doesn't tell a story more a big time snooze fest while the actors are all personable the story is so trite and goes nowhere i think victor rasuk has great charisma but deserves a real film from a real storyteller
its awful i cant believe that one of the greatest nonsenses in the world can be a blockbuster and the favorite movie of millions of people a movie which has no shahrukh khan has been appeared on the screen with nothing new the same as usual he is trying to make you cry by start scrambling his head for thousands of think this is to zinta spouse to act the character of a pakistani girl i didn't know that there is enough facilities in pakistan for the pakistani girls to do so many plastic surgeries on their face and also there are enough make up facilities and also i didn't know that an indian can cross the between both to pakistan and start dancing and singing may be pakistani were sleeping
the only way this is a family drama is if parents explain everything wrong with its they feed a deer for a year and then kill it for eating their food after killing its mother and at first pontificating about taking responsibility for their actions they blame bears and deer for misbehaving by eating while they take no responsibility to use adequate locks and fences or even learn to shoot instead of twice maiming animals and letting them linger
there is a scene near the beginning after a shootout where horses are running if something red catches your eye it is because a white van is parked behind a bush by the trail i thought i had seen bad but this is it a white van in a western did they not catch this oh well and i paid top dollar at the rental it will make you want to grab your buddies and have them all put in grand and make a better movie the talking was so so slow the acting was mostly ok but couldn't be taken seriously due to the poor nature of the filming there is a door at the sheriffs that looks like a door today with the particular trimming i say watch this movie and move cabin boy into on the worst of all time
this movie really deserves the treatment a pseudo-ancient fantasy hack-n-slash tale featuring twin barbarian brothers with a collective iq of hot water character names that seem to have been derived from a mad libs book and such classic lines as hold her down and uncover her belly the barbarians crosses over into the so bad good territory
i stole this movie when i was a freshmen in college i've tried to watch it three times the second two because friends wanted to see it sweet adam sandler i've never heard of this movie but since so funny its gotta be funny wrong i can't make myself watch this pile of crap after the dream boxing war where burning the guy with a good zinger causes your opponent physical pain you would think that terrible comedy hurting you is ridiculous but after watching this you'll know its true this movie isn't worth the price i paid for it i've watched a ton of steven segal movies and i've even watched crossroads twice but i still couldn't watch this
i cant describe how terrible this movie is am i the only one here who finds the way its animated totaly disgusting the men of rohan look fake with their poorly colored hair that doesnt even come close to matching what the actors look like the orcs looked terrible why does gandalf walk with a bad limp why cant they pronounce things correctly saruman isnt aruman there were other what sounded like terrible of tolkiens characters all and all im glad the studio who made this pulled the plug out from the sequal it was just a terrible terrible adaptaion go watch the hobbit cartoon for a better cartoon of tolkiens work hell even the cartoon version of rotk is better then this dribble
there is an awful lot wrong with this picture beginning with a script that is both obvious and redundant courtney cox plays a comic book artist who escapes to a small desert town after being raped twice in the big city she immediately is stalked by a local who appears quite unhinged sheffer and who seems to be attempting a third rate mickey rourke imitation sweeny is a local cop who is supposedly there to protect and serve meanwhile the script manipulates the audience as to really the good guy logic flies out the window after the first ten minutes and never returns and there are more unanswered questions than there should be if you think blue desert might be saved by the wonderful philip baker hall you will be disappointed his part is insignificant just like the entire movie merk
this is easily the worst ridley scott film ridley scott is a wonderful director but this film is a black mark on his career demi moore and viggo mortensen both totally miscast in an overaggressive film about a girl going to the army very stupid and there is never one scene that is convincing in any way it is really not difficult to make a film such as this everything the crew makes could have been an idea of just anybody the writers didn't have much inspiration either many foolish dialogs that made no sense at all and some brainless action i strongly recommend to stay away from this rubbish i hope that the many talented persons involved in this project realize this type of film does not deserve their attention and that in the future they will work on more honorable and more intelligent movies than this useless mess
i was expecting the movie based on grendel the book written by john gardner in the late it was based on the beowulf epic but told from the perspective of the monster you may think of book a movie based on the beowulf epic should not be entitled grendel when it doesn't say anything more about the monster beyond the few pathetic scenes in which the cg monster is shown as nothing more than a modified predator top of this the writers should also be punished for screwing up the original story so badly and contributing to the continued growing ignorance of mass tv audiences throughout the hollywood to get this so wrong disappointing and a complete waste of time
all logic goes straight out of the train window in this british horror film set in the london underground and starring the usually reliable franka potente lola run franka plays kate a businesswoman on the way from an office party to meet friends who falls asleep at an underground station only to wake up and find she has been locked in and finds herself being chased by someone or something with killer holes and unbelievability are rife and there are very few moments that are actually scary but plenty that are just plain in all an unpleasant film that should just stay locked underground forever and do us all a only plus point here is the inclusion in the cast of popular veteran actor ken campbell done better than this even including erasmus microman
i can't tell you how angry i was after seing this movie the characters are not the slightest bit interesting and the plot is non-existant so after waiting to see how the lives of these characters affected each other hoping that the past and a half hours were leading up to some significant finish what do we get a storm of frogs now yes i understand the references to the bible and the underlying theme but first of all it was presented with absolutely no resolution and second of all it would be lost to anyone who has not read the bible significant portion of the population or charles fort still larger portion as a somewhat well read person i thought this movie was a self indulgent poor imitation of a seinfeld waste your time it would be better spent anything to be honest
some of the worst least natural acting performances i've ever seen which is perhaps not surprising given the clunky lame dialog given to the one note characters add to that the cheap production values and you've got a movie that doesn't look like it even belongs on television one doesn't expect much from a lifetime movie especially one this old but this is nearly unwatchably a dreadful clich√©d romance of a type even harlequin would consider beneath them possible to guess how the remainder of the movie will go by simply watching the opening couple of scenes surprise the only female character who gets any focus and the mysterious stranger end up falling in love
abysmal with a capital a this has got to be one of if not the unfunniest show on tv right now i'm about as anti-bush as it gets but this show doesn't even get a chuckle out of me what you think of bush as a president has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not you'll like this piece of crap show the jokes are not funny at all for example in a scene when lil bush has his underwear on his head welcome to camp al-qa-eeda there is nothing funny about that is it even supposed to be joke the commercials that were shown in the weeks leading up to the show hyping it up were funnier than the show itself and just sad hopefully this does not even get considered for a second season it shouldn't even have had a first
there are a lot of pretentious people out there who will pretend that this is endowed with some kind of beautiful meaning and that ignorant fools like me don't get it obviously this means that we should stick to hollywood has every a-hem artistic clich√© in the book i guess it is good that the director is one of the chosen few almost a self parody drowning in its own director of the equally embarrassing movie ratcatcher returns with another piece wallowing in artistic nonsense it is difficult to understand and apparently is a study of alienation the best way to describe this film is alienating for its viewers
i'd completely forgotten about this film until now this was the most blatant and worst attempt to demonise a hobby that i have ever seen message seemed to be don't teenagers use their imagination they might take games seriously go mad and hurt people i can only guess that the unimaginative writers of this piece thought that style games are form of evil ritual or arcane worship
ok for starters taxi driver is amazing this this is not taxi driver or amazing what it is is bad but i thought it was bad funny which means that it did have some redeeming qualities like the there was more or less no plot the characters were all stupid and the movie was preachy there were some places were i thought the movie would dive into taxi driver type violence which would have hit the message at the end of the movie on the head much harder i can't even believe that there are like other people who have seen this movie yeah worth watching if you are real bored and you want to reaffirm the fact that anyone can make a movie or at least can try to
there are laughs in this film that is for sure michael keaton is a talent and he used to be funny he decided he was a serious actor however what bothers me so much about this film is how unlikable practically all of the characters are other than the main two leads everybody is a jerk i mean these small town losers are about as uncouth as you can get you just watch and think man these losers should be unemployed moreover the american factory worker is portrayed as a lazy and ungrateful slob it made me wonder if this film was made by japanese nationalists oh sure in the end they all come together as one but i just did not enjoy the trip to get there
this is a movie about animal cruelty under the guise of a marathon race we see depictions of extreme animal abuse including literally running a horse to death in slow motion the guy who did this then has his conscience spiritually cleansed by the flames from the of the horse which of course is still dead having been tortured to death this is one of the sickest slimiest movies i've ever had the displeasure of viewing as gene hackman and james coburn near the finish line on their dying animals we're supposed to admire their spirit for finishing the race i'd like to put the producers and director in a marathon race i'll decide when they're finished probably about minutes after they stop breathing
no love horror movies but this has got to be the poorest attempt to make one ever calling it a movie is also a stretch this woman-trying-to-act-sexy-edited-poorly-together is not worth this is about as interesting watching as some random holiday pictures and it has about the same quality you would expect when you send your ten year old son into the woods with your new vid-cam and tell him to make a
i had the misfortune to watch this rubbish on sky cinema max in a cold winter night i am not a big fan of horror movies because most of them are just trash this one is even worse it is one of the dumbest pieces of crap i've ever seen in my whole life horror movie yes there are horrible things in this the acting the script and the special effects gosh i laughed at this ludicrous attempt to make a flick for minutes actually had it been a comic movie i would've given it a don't you even think about renting this unless you want to mock at the out of didn't vote one because it made me laugh all the time
i've seen the original non-dubbed german version and i was surprised how bad this movie actually is thinking i had seen my share of bad movies like ghoulies rabid grannies zombie lake and such nothing could've prepared me for this it really was a pain to sit through this flick as no plot no good acting and even the special effects aren't convincing especially the so-called zombies wearing nothing more than white make-up and their old clothes so their good set wouldn't be ruined by ketchup and marmalade stains you really want to waste minutes of your life then watch it for all the others don't do it because you will regret it
impressed this is the worst srk movie and one of the worst bollywood movies i ever saw i didn't like the novel but this movie made it worse very bad music even worse actors from srk of course though even he doesn't manage to save the movie and not much sense the director makes it all look very confusing god knows why maybe because trying to make it all look very surrealistic and yet credible well he manages if you've got a few hours to loose don't watch this movie please this for your own welfare keep searching you will find something else to watch
this film deals with two ex-football players who are fred williamson derringer and gary busey who work as private eyes and meet all kinds of ladies and men with some bad backgrounds mack derringer is approached by his ex-wife vanity derringer who works at having sex talk over the telephone jennifer is being threatened by one caller who wants to do horrible things to her and she asks for his help along with several other ladies mack lenny have more time on their hands and often go to miami fl golf courses or hang out in a sports bar where all kinds of city things go on there is lots of punches killings and plenty of double meaning words that bring this film completely down to a big zero don't waste your time this film cost me only cents and that was too much
i never like to comment on a good film but when it comes to a bad movie i gotta come really hard on it talking about vivah this guy sooraj badjatya seems to have completely lost it after success of hum aapke hain kaun he thought he can make money with cheesy wedding videos vivah is so so cheesy that badjatyas have left johars and chopras was not a single moment during the movie where i can say oh at least this thing is good aloknath does clich√© in a role of father shahid kapoor looks fat and shahrukhed amrita rao is another disaster in addition to ugly looking sets bad costumes hackneyed storyline monstrous stepmother trying-hard-to-act actors cacophonous background music cheap the spoiler i'm warning you guys that as happens in all his other movies after a calamitous incidence movie ends on a happy note
this movie was on the other day and i didn't enjoy it at all the first george of the jungle was a good comedy but the sequel completely awful the new actor and actress to play the lead roles weren't good at all they should of had the original actor fraiser and original actress forgot her name so this movie gets the out of ten rating not a film that you can sit down and watch and enjoy this is a film that you turn to another channel or take it back to the shop if hired or bought it was good to see ape the ape back but wasn't as fun as the first they should of had the new george as georges son grown up and still had bredon and her face in the film that would've been a bit better then it was
are you kidding me a show highlighting someone who opens cans and envelopes for a meal how talented do you have to be to do this she may be able to cook but it is not portrayed in this half-hour stomach churning painful production i know she has a martha-stewart-esquire empire so does warren buffett but i don't see him with fake knockers opening cans of cream corn and has a nephew brycer stop talking about anyone a name that time is spent on table-scapes than actual cooking who has that kind of time silicon should be on your spatula not on my tv this show should be on cartoon network not food network
the coming attractions to the order make it seem like a decent horror but what we get is a plot that has potential to be excellent all thrown together to form a pile of off the whole movie consists of terrible dialogue and god awful special affects the acting was also nothing to be proud of but keath ledger think i spelled that right saved the movie in this sake don't see this movie
hearing such praise about this play i decided to watch it when i stumbled across it on cable i don't see how this elivates women and their struggles by focusing on the topic at hand i guess if you have an interest in stories about private parts and how it affects their lives then this is for you otherwise rather dull and boring if anything i found it a bit inquired with a female friend who also watched this and she thought it was horrible as well so not just a guy not getting it
i desperately want to give this movie a really do some movies especially horror movies are so budget that they are good a wise-cracking ninja scarecrow who can implement corn cobs as lethal fits this budget to brilliance system the depth of the movie is definitely its strong point and the twists and turns it implements keeping the audience at the edge of their seats really drives the puberty-stricken pre-thirty year old scarecrow into the limelight as the creepiest horror icon of the year all i can really say is can you dig it and recommend watching movies such as frankenfish if you enjoy this sort of hilarious the hell were they smoking
i must pat myself on the back for watching this movie all the way through because it truly was painful an incapable painter becomes a fully capable hit-man this movie was rife with absurdities of which if i mentioned them all i would be giving away the movie norm peterson aka george wendt must really be in a rut to have agreed to do this movie the acting was deplorable and the story was even worse as a sane minded and rational individual i could not understand where the writer came from nor where he was going with this movie there was ineptness on the part of every main character there was a string of hapless and ridiculous events then the movie ended one absurd act after another with dialogue doesn't make a movie it only makes a talkative train wreck
this move is slow plodding cold dark and without a plot or hope it follows that tried and true european formula that they love to subsidize that is never seen but that the critics think makes an important movie is valuable if nothing more than to show the huge difference in the thinking between americans and europeans regarding employment in this movie the men are still nursing their wounds from years ago and feel the duty to provide them with work whereas in the we know we have to go out there and create value for never looked so backward
being a big fan of the other planet of the apes films i rented this dvd despite my aversion to all things tim burton once again he doesn't fail to disappoint with his uninspired direction even the ape makeup looks second rate which is unforgivable considering the monstrous budget of this monstrosity mark wahlberg proves once and for all that he is not an actor if boogie nights wasn't proof enough i was embarrassed for genuine talents such as tim roth and helena bonham carter no doubt their paychecks motivated them since it couldn't possibly have been the cliche-ridden screenplay i rented this dvd on a special night and i still feel ripped off
plot synopsis when his wife a news reporter is kidnapped replaced with an android double secret service agent eric phillips tracks her down uncovers a plan by an arms dealer to create an army of invincible androids to assassinate world wasn't expecting much when i first saw this sequel to richard low-budget sci-fi action hybrid cyber tracker that film was nothing special not to mention a blatant rip-off of both the terminator robocop this sequel is the same as before with an all-out action sequence opening the film there are plenty of explosions heavy gunfire a huge bodycount as well as some martial-arts moves courtesy of the star don the dragon wilson the whole film seems like a series of action scenes strung together with minimal plot on the acting front wilson is a bad actor he really needs a personality transplant
this movie never made it to theaters in our area so when it became available on dvd i was one of the first to rent it for once i should listened to the critics and passed on this the excellent line up of actors the movie was very disappointing i can see now why it went straight to video had thought that with bloom ledger and rush it could have some value all have done wonderful work in the past movie was slow moving and never pulled me in i failed to develop much empathy for the characters and had to fight the urge to fast-forward just to get to the end do not recommend this film even if you are thinking of renting it for only for eye candy purposes it won't satisfy even that
i usually enjoy loretta early movies her acting back then was light and breezy and she sure knew how to wear clothes but this one is just a loser from the word go except for a funny supporting turn by glenda farrell young is a hatcheck girl who talks her writer-husband lukas into becoming a championship bridge player not the most cinematic of games and the long talky middle part in which their marriage falls apart just about kills the one interesting bit though as lukas and ferdinand gottschalk start their climactic game a series of quick shots show airplanes trains football games even a diver in mid-air freezing in anticipation of the event the earliest use of a freeze frame i've seen in an american film wish the rest of it were that inventive-and funny
i'm never much for classic films movies like patton going my way how green was my valley the godfather casablanca annie hall gone with the wind lawrence of arabia and citizen kane bore me however i would much rather watch any one of those films times while being tied up on a chair than watch an american in paris once in the most luxurious suite ever if i did the latter i'd probably be sleeping the entire color art direction and the music didn't interest me gershwin or non-gershwin the dancing and the singing could help an insomniac fall to sleep the dialogue doesn't match up to singin in the rain basically this movie is boring the only other film that i fell asleep while watching was butch cassidy and the sundance kid but you can't blame me i only slept minutes the night bad we can't give zeroes
must have to agree with the other reviewer this has got to be the worst movie let alone western i have ever seen terrible acting dialogue that was unimaginative and pathetic alone completely inappropriate for supposedly being in the and oh did i mention a battery pack prominently displayed on the back of one of the characters i was waiting for the boom mike to fall in the middle of a scene and the ending the least i can say is that it was consistent with the rest of the awful and yes it did contain every clich√© in the book from the slow walk down the empty dusty road to the laughable remember when shots when a main character dies luckily i saw this on free tv don't waste your time
five passengers at a bus depot tell each other their scary dreams while waiting to be picked up but is there more to these nightmares than meets the me five bad movies for the price of one each segment features the very worst in acting special effects make up and music and these were supposed to be scary hmm i think i've been more freaked out during an episode of teletubbies i swear you'll sit there like i was bored to tears waiting in vain for something interesting to happen don't bother it never does in fact i even stopped fast forwarding the commercials as they were a good deal more entertaining than the main feature and the ending is the ultimate cop-out yep none of this actually ever happened if only the same could be said for the day i set my vcr to record this cobblers
without a doubt this is one of the worst films i've ever wasted money on the plot is erm sorry did i say there was a plot the scariest moment was when nope can't think of one the best special effect that had me hiding under the bed covers was nope can't think of one for that either you knew who the killer was right from the start there was nothing scary about the whole movie in fact the only two vaguely interesting bits were when you saw the kid sister misty in the shower and when you saw nurse toppan take her top off this film should only be watched to get an idea of how not to make a horror movie
a chemical spill is turning people into zombies up to two to survive the epidemic an andreas schnaas film so you know what the par for the course will be bad acting horribly awful special effects and no budget to speak of the dubbing is ridiculous with a capital r and the saddest thing is that i feel compelled to write one word about this piece of excrement much less the ten lines mandatory because of the guidelines placed on me by imdb my original review of merely one word crap wouldn't fly so i have to revise it and go more in to how bad it is but i don't know if i can so wait i think i may have enough words or lines rather to make this review pass which is cool i guess so in summation this movie sucks balls don't watch grade f
what else can you say about this that plain louise and adam west are the reasons why to see their talents are wasted in this think that they used a double in some of when running because you can't see his adam was embarrassed in being in zombie think what he must've felt about appearing in this if it was before or not nightmare is a out the mystery science theater version first and to gang is very annoying and over-acting by some of the rip-off of the wild one starring marlon looks stunning hope her and adam got a good paycheck pass
this bomb is just one explosion after another with no humor and only absurd situations really pyrotechnics to the extreme reality is not one of its strong points i give it a out of i would have made it a zero but that option wasn't permitted sorry but lithgow and sutherland deserve better roles but then at times we all need to have money and i still recoil at that tim burton farce about mars nicholson was brave enough to admit that was a turkey but if that was a turkey this movie then is not even a gizzard i wish i could say give me back my money you can bet i would if i could but that is the trouble with premium services the subscription variety
i was hoping that this film was going to be at least watchable the plot was weak to say the least i was expecting a lot more considering the cast line up wonder if any of them will include this on their cvs at least i didn't pay to rent it the best part of the film is definitely dani behr but the rest of the film is complete and utter pants
one wonders why this picture was made at all the plot as such is totally unbelievable if not ridiculous the characters loner cop versus younger one quite fascinated quite predictable the ending totally murky and impossible to understand after several viewings but you'd have to have a masochistic tendency for that the idea being you have to read the book to understand fully what all the acting is bad was the basic idea to show that french film makers are able to do as well as americans in the genre that include seven and silence of the lambs if so it is a total failure it was quite a success though has a sort of cult-status as the first french serial killer it seems considered as a good product to export strange
the film is poorly casted except for some familiar old hollywood names other performances by unknown names jennifer gabrielle are uninspiring i have seen other films by this director unfortunately this is one of his worst perhaps this is a reflection of the screenplay a positive note kim and pat performance saved the movie from oblivion i enjoyed pat more in karate kid though there are many good movies to see and in short this one is not one of them save your money and the celluloid vanness
the latest rumor going around is that is starting casting calls for i love new york mid so does this mean budah or tailor made dumped new york or does this mean new york dumped the know flavor of love is coming up to season so now with a flavor of love and a i love new york there ever be a true also heard a few rumors that chance will be brought back for the season of i love new york i have also heard rumors that new york will be specially featured on flavor of love this was not too much of a spoiler for the ending of i love new york just stating the latest rumor
the message of this movie is personality is more important than beauty jeanine garofalo is supposed to be the ugly duckling but the funny thing is that not at all ugly a lot more attractive than uma thurman the friend who looks like a would this movie work if the ugly duckling was really unattractive when will hollywood stop with this my opinion despite the message that it wants to convey this movie is simply
ghost of dragstrip hollow is a typical teens in turmoil movie it is not a horror or science fiction movie plot concerns a group of teens who are about to get kicked out of their hot rod club because they cannot meet the rent once kicked out they decide to try an old haunted house the only saving grace for the film is that the ghost blaisdell in the she creature suit turns out to be an out of work movie monster played by blaisdell
if you liked the grinch movie go watch that again because this was no where near as good a seussian movie translation mike myers cat is probably the most annoying character to grace the screen in recent times his is terrible and he laughs at his own jokes with an awful weasing sound which is about the only laughing i heard at the theater not even the kids liked this one folks and kids laugh at anything now save your money and go see looney tunes back in action if you're really looking for a fun holiday family movie
after watching about half of this i was ready to give up and turn it off but i endured to the end this is a movie that tries to be a romantic comedy and fails the acting is worse than the acting in are several attempts at humour that fail miserably and the movie is predictable perhaps if you are a teenager this movie will hold some appeal but for those that have seen many movies you will know how the film turns out after the first minutes the rest of your time will be spent in agony waiting for the ending credits to waste your time watching this
this film describes the experiences of a couple of hit men of them burt reynolds a prostitute and two drag queens over the interval of a few hours on one night in miami the convergent storylines eventually bring all the people together at one place and time the movie was mildly entertaining but the big problem was that everything happens at night and many scenes were literally under-exposed to the point that it was impossible to see what was happening in a few scenes you can actually see where they tried to stretch the developing process to save the images somebody didn't know how to operate a movie camera amazing that this film was even released
the tv guide calls this movie a mystery what is a mystery to me is how is it possible that a culture that can produce such intricate and complex classical music and brilliant mathematicians cannot produce a single film that would rise above the despicable trash level this film so perfectly represents this is bollywood at its i honestly cannot tell the difference nauseatingly sweet kitschy clich√©s on every level story-line situations dialog music and choreography to put it bluntly you must be a retard to enjoy it i watched it to satisfy my cultural curiosity but there were times when i had to walk away from it because i could not take it any more the only redeeming quality of the movie is the exquisite beauty of the leading actresses
this stalk and slash turkey manages to bring nothing new to an increasingly stale genre a masked killer stalks young pert girls and slaughters them in a variety of gruesome ways none of which are particularly not scary not clever and not funny so what was the point of it
first be warned that i saw this movie on tv and with dubbed english which may have entirely spoiled the atmosphere however i'll rate what i saw and hope that will steer people away from that version i found this movie excruciatingly dull all the atmosphere is lost with dubbing leaving the slow frustration of a stalker movie i'm sorry but the worst movie sin in my book is to be slow except when the movie about philosophy i didn't see any deep philosophical meaning in this movie maybe i missed something but i have to tell it like i see it i rated it a what can i say oriented tastes maybe
i may not be a critic but here is what i think of this movie well just watched the movie on cinemax and first of all i just have to say how much i hate the storyline i mean come on what does a snowman scare besides little kids secondly it is pretty gory but i bet since the movie is so low budget they probably used ketchup so my critical vote is bomb nice try and the sequel will suck twice as much
the long list of big names in this flick the ubiquitous john mills didn't bowl me over to the extent that i couldn't judge the film on its actual merits it is full of stereotypes caricatures and standard set scenes from the humble air-ace hero to the loud-mouthed yank flyer the music track was such that at one point about an hour before the end i thought the film was over loud rising crescendo grand flourish and finish then silence but then the movie continued i found no real storyline haphazard writing but smartly-pressed uniforms and the pretty jean simmons job with a rousing little ditty i cannot say that this picture has any of the ingredients which make a film great i found it maudlin mawkish and minor
reading through all these positive reviews i find myself baffled how is it that so many enjoyed what i consider to be a woefully bad adaptation of my second favourite jane austen novel there are many problems with the film already mentioned in a few reviews simply put it is a hammed-up over-acted chintzy mess from opening credits to butchered many characters are mis-cast and neither ewan mcgregor nor toni collette puts in a performance that is worthy of them the worst by far is paltrow i have very much enjoyed her performance in some roles but here she is abominable she is self-conscious nasal slouching and entirely disconnected from her characters and those around her an extremely disappointing effort though even a perfect emma could not have saved this film
when husband-to-be is murdered on the eve of their wedding she retreats to a mountain lodge where she slips of off a cliff and is rescued by wealthy attorney morgan morgan falls in love with her leading to a definitely one-sided marriage spent on a huge estate in chicago appears to be surrounded by mountains stanwyck is tempted by dashing cortez but eventually returns to morgan in a very subdued and unconvincing story film has a great cast in particular is one of my favorites and a great director but the script is meandering and seems pointless at times i was so ready to enjoy this movie but i was ultimately disappointed still worth watching for the cast and good for anyone who likes films
i have no idea how anyone managed to stay awake during this show the acting was ham-fisted and amateur the story was old news and plot development lack thereof invariably had my eyelids sagging less than halfway through each episode about all there is to say of it because it genuinely lacked substance of any can you people like crap like this freaking stupid an insult to your intelligence i don't even know how to further explain it as if some of you will stare mindlessly at junk like this solely because you like the way some of the actors look or because for whatever crazy reason you haven't seen the same formulas in dozens of shows a million times just forget it this show sucked and thankfully gone forever i wish they'd get to work on demolishing the once and for all
it felt like i watched this movie thousand times was absolutely time the story tried to get a bit time i awaited something interesting to happen i saw nothing but what i expected like the bread factory opened up another there was not enough bread in two has become a special the dumb russian was a bit funny while punishing around the bad pile of muscles was so incredibly it made me laugh at him for a moment i wonder why i waste my time spitting on that shame-of-a-movie it won't get worse it is not possible d
the only thing i remember about this movie are two things first as a twelve year old even i thought it stunk second it was so bad that when mad magazine did a parody of it they quit after the first page and wrote a disclaimer at the bottom of the page saying that they had completely disavowed you want to see great sophomoric comedies of this period try animal house so stupid and vulgar it lowers itself to high art another good selection would be caddyshack the classic with the late rodney dangerfield and bill murray before he became annoyingly charming with great lines like greens keeper carl correct me if i'm wrong sandy but if i kill all the golfers they'll lock me up and throw away the key
i saw this movie in the middle of the night when i was flipping through the channels and there was nothing else on to watch one of those films where you stop to see what it is just for a moment but realize after twenty minutes or so that you just can't turn it off no matter how bad it is one of those movies that is somewhere in between being so bad good and so bad well just plain bad worth seeing just to experience the confusion of realizing that both great middle-of-the-night fare if only for the fabulous tennis drag don't even bother asking yourself why nobody can tell that chad lowe is so obviously male because logic does not apply
i saw this movie the other night i can't even begin to express how much this movie sucked the writing the voice acting even the claymation terrible terrible terrible like watching hours of c-span for the sake of comedy it just doesn't work it literally falls flat at about every spot the animation is very poor quality i know that this is an movie made by one person but to think that he could make minutes worth of crap maybe he could at least make second worth of show may take the cake for being the worst film of all time yikes it really was that bad if you're looking for a movie that will make you laugh steer clear from this abomination my advice don't even buy it or look it up for that matter your brain will than you
movies usually ain't bad because i will find them enjoyable this one is so bad that i am out of words to describe it its below bad there is an instruction in the beginning of the film that tell you what to do during the movie needless to say the instruction and a dozen of beer couldn't help me seat through the entire film one tagliner compares this one to killbill which is certainly unthinkable and an insult to our intelligent obviously this tagliner had a plan to tempt you into buying this you are considering renting this one put it down if you are thinking of buying dont think if you unlucky to have this dvd dont play it throw it in trash bin immediately
awful simply awful it proves my theory about star power this is supposed to be great tv because the guy who directed titanica is the same guy who directed this shlop schtock schtick about a chick b o r i n something a thousand times more interesting to do like watch your tv with no picture and no sound rated it so high there aren't any negative scores in the rating my theory about star power is the more star power used in a show the weaker the show is called an indirect proportionality quality power less sp makes for better quality etc another way to look at it is more is
i cannot believe how bad this piece of garbage is i want my back words defy description of this poorly made piece of crap the dubbing in no way shape or form aligns with the mouths the movie looks like it was filmed with a vintage camcorder i have shot better movies with my cell phone camera the gore is laughable due to the silly unbelievable plot the acting is what one would expect if you called all your friends over on a saturday afternoon and proceeded to get completely ripped then tried to put on a play in your garage don't get me wasn't expecting o'neil and i love zombie movies but the production values are so low in this film as to make it unwatchable avoid
my sincere advice to all don't watch the even go near to the theater where this movie is being played even a glimpse of it is bad for health serious no jokes am in the morning and i returned from this crappiest movie on this universe four hours damn i am proud that i survived after all of it if this is called am highly frustrated annoyed disappointed it was sheer waste of time money went in drain no plot hope i wake up tomorrow sane and with no memories of this night rubbish republic day to one and all
this one probably does not fit in the bottom of the barrel of mediocre slasher movies but surely a damn bad holiday premise made it kind of interesting but after the first scenes the movie demonstrates poor production values and stupid plot i mean the sub-genre was at the moment all about an unseen maniac slashing teens for no apparent reasons but this one took it too far there is absolutely no coherence in the events or nothing else to clich√®s are more than boring the gore is minimal and so does the is a fairly mediocre slasher entry that shouldn't be hyped even if it has a video nastie am truly disappointed by this overrated piece of trash
at least not full of sensless violence or fluff also not very full of thought or a smooth storyline this story had some potential but the director appears to have lost site of the green the story is disjointed and goes off in to no conclusion i also don't believe the director spent much time around a golf country club either some of the depictions are absurd not very engaging
i have seen many a horror flick in my time all of them absurdly bad but none reach the depths that this piece of trash lowers itself to this movie made me angrier and angrier as i watched it as i tried to wrap my head around exactly what this movie was about now after i've seen it i understand sort of what was going on and why but the movie itself is just too confusing to be enjoyable when you're watching it yes there are the customary scenes of gratuitious violence one-liners that show the mind-blowing insightfulness of its characters highway belongs to and enough nudity to sufficiently distract us from the plot but still you'll leave this movie feeling alone and taken advantage of like a puppy who isn't wanted anymore and is left in a box by the side of the road blech
what a forgot to brush your make a minute show about it and have a couple of kids make some noise and then have the dad lecture them all because what he has to don't forget uncle joey has to make some weird noises and cooky faces then uncle jesse has to show up with his black leather jacket and some jeans and look pretty for a few minutes while everybody discusses how mother would have done things if she were full of zany little adventures about a whole bunch of nothing and an entire overlong story to build around house will not only bore you to tears but it will make you age twenty times faster than you normally would
dolph lundgren stars as murray wilson an alcoholic ex-cop who gets involved with a serial killer who kills during sex after his brother is murdered wilson starts his own investigation and finds out a lot of his secrets in this very dull thriller lundgren mails in his performance and the movie is flat and lethargic also when has anyone watched a dolph lundgren movie for anything but action
this is a bad movie not one of the funny bad ones either this is a lousy bad one it was actually painful to watch the direction was lots of jumping around and the green and yellow hues used throughout the movie makes the characters look sickly keira knightly was not convincing as a tough chick at i cannot believe lucy liu and mickey rourke signed on for this criminal waste of celluloid the script was terrible and the acting was like fingernails across a chalkboard if you haven't seen you are not missing anything and will only waste two hours of your life watching this drivel i have seen bad movies before and even enjoyed them due to their faults this one is just a waste of time
i don't know where to begin tara reid needs to be stopped before put in another movie stephen dorff looks like he got his motivation from val kilmer in top gun slater sleepwalks through this dreck the direction editing sound we really need a heavy-metal video in the middle of a gunfight costumes vests with muscles on them and hey no discernible plot either it amazes me that no one attached to the project stopped and said hey guys this just doesn't make any sense start over hopefully career can rebound from this down the worst film i've ever seen
despite the excellent cast this is an unremarkable film especially from the aviation perspective it may be somewhat better than the egregious von richthofen and brown but not by much blue max remains the best of a small market over the last years while darling lilli is fun if not taken seriously interesting to speculate what ilm could do with zeppelins and gothas in a new high-quality ww i aero film
beyond dirt cheap this shot-on-video exercise in ineptitude was difficult to get through got the typical gore that you'd expect in a zombie movie but none of the required atmosphere to make it worth strange is that this is an amateur german video and the version i saw is english-dubbed the dubbers seem to be american fans of the germans who can't decide whether they want to play it straight or turn it into a comedy one character white german of course is dubbed by a black guy apparently who speaks with thick ebonics kno wahm sayin comrad
i like end-of-days movies i like b-movies i was hoping i would like this could ignore the poor effects the often atrocious music the cringe-inducing lines i could ignore the unexplained events and the fact that the movie constantly relies on deus ex machina is excusable given the subject matter i could ignore the fact that the people who fight hunger and try to reach world peace are the bad guys none of these things kill the movie what kills this movie is that just plain and simple boring nothing actually happens almost all scenes in the movie are designed to push the movie creators morals on the viewers at the cost of actually having a coherent story or any kind of you're looking for an entertaining b-movie look elsewhere this movie is just boring
the subject notwithstanding this is an amateur exhibitionist an effort at is about as interesting and daring as a moody high school composition book full of death poetry to be sure it will disturb viewers who are hell-bent on being disturbed but the success will be attributable to themselves not to the director to genuinely get under skin requires sensibility discipline technique and talent as well as an eye and an ear the film does contain one evocative image shown as a still also used on the video case but with no development leading up to or away from it if the director had had an eye he would have seen it as a possible starting point for an interesting is a movie
the only good thing about this movie was the shot of goldie hawn standing in her little french cut bikini panties and struggling to keep a dozen other depraved women from removing her skimpy little cotton top while she giggled and cooed ooooof her loins rival those of nina hartley this movie came out when i was fourteen and that shot nearly killed me i'd forgotten about it all tucked away in the naughty roladex of my mind until seeing it the other day on tv where they actually blurred her midsection in that scene good grief reminding me what a smokin hottie of a woman goldie hawn was in the kurt russell must have had a fun life
my friends and i walked out after minutes and we weren't the first afterwards we tried to get our money back movie theater management wouldn't allow this but they did agree to let us see another film the only time that worked for us was to see dickie roberts former child star as you can tell this wasn't a memorable night probably one of my worst movie nights close second has to be when i saw a double header of domestic disturbance and heist in conclusion for the sake of humanity please don't see the order
this movie is painfully slow and has no plot it conveys the lives of a group of laid off boatworkers one of the older ones is sincere in his attempt to get a job there may be some social commentary here but it is muddled as nobody is painted in a very sympathetic do not understand why it had a when i decided to watch it i watched the whole tedious thing and built expectations for a huge redeeming payoff no luck the imdb rating has always been such a good match for my tastes anything above was worth my wife says javier barem does not even look good in this movie not my type so my agreement does not mean i give it a
i don't remember a movie where i have cared less about where the characters have come from what happens to them or where they are going i realize that greatest pastime is navel-gazing but these people are either too despicable or too boring to take up time with for what worth though the discussion that followed the showing under the auspices of the key sunday cinema series did make allowance that possibly the three women did show some redeeming characteristics i disagree
having read during many years about how great this film was how it established ruiz among the french critics the snobbish cahiers crowd when i finally watched it about a year ago i found it pretty disappointing then i guess my expectations were sky-high shot in saturated black and white this deliberately cerebral film for tv and mercifully only an hour long is told in the form of a conversation between an art connoisseur and an off-screen narrator as they ponder through a series of paintings are shown in the style of tableaux vivants and try to find if they hold some clues about a hidden political crime awful kate beckinsale film uncovered has a similar argument borgesian is a word i read a lot in reviews about this movie but i would say almost any borges story is more interesting than this film
a friend and i went through a phase some of years ago of selecting the crappest horror films in the video shop for an entertainment for some reason i ended up buying this one v v cheap synth soundtrack is a classic of its time and genre also a few very amusing scenes among them is a scene where a being attacked and defends himself with a number of unlikely objects it made me laugh at the time seem quite so funny in retrospect but there you from that total crap mind you but probably worth a watch if you like films like chopping mall yes i've seen that too
as a poker enthusiast i was looking forward to seeing this movie especially as it had scotty nyugen in scotty nyugens short spots in this film are all it has going for characters are unlikeable and annoying the soundtrack is awful and the plot well there isn't honestly got a headache and found myself reading the barcode number on the dvd box after twenty minutes i was that bored its actually ashame that nyugen was in this movie as otherwise i wouldn't have wasted buying it off it from me avoid like offsuit dire
for those looking for a sequel for the fine south african miniseries of the this isn't it nor is it a historical drama rather it is a dreary little fantasy which has nothing to do with the historical shaka but merely uses his name to give a certain cachet to idiotic story about an african superhero who is a combination of jesus lincoln superman and nelson the other hand there are a few laugh-out-loud moments as when shaka breaks the cross to which he is chained and kicks some serious slaver butt you know like jesus would have done if he hadn't been such a i saw only the version but i can't imagine that twice as much of this crap would have been what kind of a name is mungo
this movie promised bat people it didn't deliver there was a guy who got bit by a bat but what was with the seizures and the stupid transformation where was the plot where was the acting who came up with the idea to make this why was it allowed to be made why why i guess we'll never know
this is one of the worse cases of film drivel i have seen in a long while it is so awful that i am not sure where to begin or even if it is worth it the plot is the real problem and i feel sorry for sly as he puts in a decent performance for his part but that plot oh dear oh dear i particularly love the way near the end he manages to pop from the foot of a mountain to the top whilst the helicopter is on the way a climb of a day or two takes him all of five minutes i could go on but it isn't worth it apart from the grim opening even a five year old would be able to predict the outcome of the rest is drivel sorry folks but this is about as bad as film making gets
perhaps not my genre but plot was horrible as was acting by nancy allen and linda farentino c thomas also seemed uncomfortable in role of being seduced here on marijuana why did this need to be included this weakened plot considerably also charac would have been better had she had more respect for a relationship would does movie try to say not much
just saw this movie and what a waste of time the movie was predictable and slow basically the mormon bad news bears that play church sanctioned basketball rather than watching this movie i should have had a root canal the cameo performances were obviously driven by sponsorship funding this movie had potential due to the outrageous behavior that is exhibited by mormons when they play church sanctioned basketball however because rated pg the true nature of the spectacle could not be transfered to film the acting is horrible with the exception of clint howard and fred willard thurl appearance in the film was completely unnecessary
the premise was intriguing but sadly this film just doesn't do any justice to it the casting was quite good and it was shot beautifully but stylistically much of the direction was inconsistent fast editing been there done that to no effect i was waiting for steven bochco to run in the credits followed by a commercial characters were identified exclusively by on-screen coke usage pretty much everything else left to boogie nights for character development and no personable characters to draw the viewer into the story a very forgettable film
jungle fever is too highly stylized stereotyped and comes across as essentially dishonest wesley snipes was wrong for the lead and there was no chemistry between him and annabella sciorra even though plenty of talent in this movie mostly wasted because the parts are reduced to little more than decorative cameos also instead of simply showing racism for the ugly and stupid thing it is spike lee chooses to wave it around like a flag in a most whining and irritating manner i made it through most of the film but i couldn't quite finish it and that for me rarely happens
this movie is a minute ramones concert with brief periods of stupidity and absolute boredom what kind of high school is this you are a major ramones fan do not and i repeat do not waste your time like i did this is utterly unwatchable from start to finish this movie should be called ramone fever everyone appears to like them in this movie there is not a plot to be found in this flick as far as teen comedies go you are scraping the bottom of the barrel with this one
supposedly a social commentary on racism and prison conditions in the rural south of the nightmare is full of bad southern stereotypes complete with phoney accents not only would it be offensive to the sensibilities of most american southerners this tawdry piece of work comes off as just a thinly-disguised babe in prison in its uncut original version nevertheless acting is generally above average and the late chuck connors in particular does a good job of making viewers hate though he looks somewhat uncomfortable in several scenes also a change-of-pace role for the late robert reed who appears as the lecherous warden and tina louise ginger of island made a rather believable sadistic prison guard my grade d
i found it a real task to sit through this film the sound track was not the best and some of the accents made it difficult to understand what was being said there was little to move the plot along and often the action simply stopped and there was a prolonged period of conversations which seemed extraneous to the movie these conversations switched between family groups and the observer was left to try and piece together what the common thread was that tied them together it is rare that i rate a film this low and do so in this case as the entire viewing experience left me thinking so what and why did i waste my time watching this
the only value in this movie is basically to laugh at how bad it really is with a plot that makes your average middle-school writer look good and acting which is almost as good it gets my bottom score one of tom hanks very early films where he obviously didn't have the pleasure to be real picky the best special effect of the movie consists of a guy dressed up in an incredibly fake rubber monster consume
i also saw this amazingly bad piece of anime at the london sci-fi festival if you have to watch this thing do so with a large audience preferably after a few beers you may then glean some enjoyment from it found the dialogue hilarious lodged in my mind is the introduction of cremator the animation is awful it is badly designed and badly executed it may have been a good idea for the producers to have hired at least one person who was not colour nothing else to say really this film is a failure on every level
i just want to say that this production is very one sided breaks the impartiality needed if you want to be taken seriously are no credits of the persons they interviewed so you cant have an idea if they are worthy of being the story from just one point of view to do this is very dangerous because the next generations learns the bad idea and thats why wars keep coming i know this is not the only reason about wars but doesn't help can watch this documentary but read in the internet a lot before balcans are complex as human history is
i can fondly remember bo heyday and the uk press attention mucky sun news of the world papers all following her small role in with dudley moore understandably much fuss was made of her photogenic face crystal clear blue eyes and her perfectly formed bouncing breasts acting is and never was her forte i think they should make one of the triple disc collections you always find in the bargain dvd orca tarzan the ape-man and bolero all these films could be nominated for the so bad they are would be a guilty must buy of mine should you ever read your press or this comment ms derek please do not be always had a soft spot for you and there are more important things going on in the world to worry about than your acting ability much
will they ever make movies without nudity and sex this came on at on sunday afternoon and i couldn't believe what they showed thank god my son was outside or i would have been freaked out if he had seen the porn do people who make movies not care who they offend or corrupt kids could have been watching after church and that is what they show the acting was good and i enjoyed the suspense but gee there was violence and bad guys but that is to be expected in a western movie randy travis was really good in his role if the writers directors and producers would just quit putting on so much uncalled for sex scenes what has to happen to get them to quit going in that direction where can i complain
its spelled s-l-a-s-h-e-r-s i was happy when the main character flashed her boobs that was pretty tight before and after that the movie pretty much blows the acting is like e-list and shown well in the movie not to mention it is so low budget that preacherman and chainsaw charlie are played by the same person the whole movie looks like it was shot with a camcorder instead of half way decent film the only other reason i liked the movie was because chainsaw charlie and doctor ripper were funny they said many stupid things that made me laugh other than that if you see this movie at blockbuster do everyone a favor hide it behind lawnmowerman anybody that thinks this movie is good should be mentally evaluated
this movie is actually worse than most movies i've ever suffered through and i've suffered through a lot absolute nonsense got terrible forced dialogue pointless plot developments really drawn out spooky imagery scenes which look more like a high school remedial art project than a horror movie at best attractive women long boring sex scenes involving said women what you know about virgins especially ones with sided fake breasts muttered difficult to understand speech from some of the characters and they actually used the masks from killer klowns from outer space during a masturbation scene which should be a saving grace because that movie was pretty funny but it isn't veden fell is the lamest bad guy in the history of film give this one a miss
i believe that war films should try to convey the terror of war avoid idealism and respect some rudimentary military principles zvezda barely does the first zvezda being a russian war film i was expecting patriotism sentimentality beautiful poetic pictures a lush score slavic cheekbones and cruel germans what i didn't need was the naive love non-affair the unrealistically silly war scenes and the abuse of the syrupy soundtrack in a film which avoided carefully all historical or political references nazism holocaust only to end on a passing but nonetheless insulting to our sense of history endnote about liberating poland a missed opportunity as a film but not as propaganda apparently
a young american woman visits her irish roots and fends off a druid witch who is out to possess her sounds intriguing but after an interesting start i got lost and spent most of the time wondering where it was going the movie seems to be dithering in two directions are we watching the travails of the irish-american woman battling her alcohol problem or are we watching a straight off horror flick about an evil witch that returns from the past the director can't seem to decide the two doesn't seem to gel and in the end you get nowhere this could be so much better done and the story seemed to drag towards the end this was most boring and disappointing
there is a reason why this made for british tv movie only appeared at the toronto film festival it is dull plodding and lacking in o√µtoole√µs diffident performance and the appearance of playwright harold pinter are the only elements of some british film fans will enjoy seeing philip jackson best known for his portrayal of inspector japp in the poirot television series in one of his earliest roles
i've discovered that this film gets rented based off of the packaging the zombie on the front of the dvd looks cool and scary then you get to the movie and women with raccoon masks on zero special even the fight scenes you can see them miss punches by feet the funny thing is that lommel acts in the movie briefly himself and is worse than the rest of the crap actors in the movie the only thing i can think is that lommel is just trying to make such a bad film that people dub it a cult i can't possibly imagine anyone thinking this is anything but one of the worst movies ever made the real horror in this film is how bad it is i'm embarrassed i rented it and vow never to see another lommel film again
if i had known this movie was filmed in the exasperating and quease-inducing dogme style i would never have rented it nevertheless i took a dramamine for the seasickness and gave it a shot i lasted a very very very long forty minutes before giving up just boring pretentious last french movie i saw was romance and it too was pretty dismal but at least the camera was steady and not breathing down the necks of the characters all the time i am baffled at the continuing popularity of dogme overseas it'll catch on in america about the same time as the next big outbreak of leprosy called dogme because the average number of times the actors are poked in the eye by the
the special effects of this movie are especially for its time laughable and used in such an over-emphasized way that you can't deny their terrible acting redefines the term terrible overacting at the hands of meg foster and richard joseph paul where julie newman and andrew divoff just redefine charm in this movie can be found in two things first is the excellent casting of carel lurch struycken as the mysterious psychic gaunt who can sense where and when people will die and is always second are original finds the combination sf-western is obviously original if terrible but other finds are more original like the gunman zack stone being able to sense the pain of the people he shoots his acting falls short see this movie except if you love that ol hunk-o-brutal carel struycken as any self-respecting dutchman should
the one sheets and newspaper campaign suggested often they did a far more lurid and violent piece than showed up on the drive-in screens claude brook is actually an americanization of claudio brook who worked in films for years this quite hard to find anymore i'd love to see it again to compare it to other international horrors of the day but don't remember particularly impressed way back when chances are it was a chopped up version that made it to theatres and video but oh that one a gem of my later horror collection
the idea of in the name of the people is good a murderer doesn't want his only daughter to end up in an institution and asks the parents of the girl he killed to take care of his daughter and you could expect of the actors especially scott bakula to do some good acting unfortunately they don't in the name of the people turns out to be the regular friday night tearjerker the flashbacks with the girl that was killed are pretty pathetic and at a certain stage you can just predict what the actors will say if you want to watch a good film about this subject then watch dean man walking
i seems in the beginning a interesting film a spanish thriller in a interesting nowadays madrid but it none of that is actually a film only interesting for future films directors learning about what not to do making a film it be worse in others words even the presence of a oscar winner mira sorvino enough to justify the dollars expended to see this film the acting is horrendous and it seems the actors were just waiting to finish the daily shots to go home it lead to nowhere and is boring weak and bad expend time or money on this film
blood surf aka krocodylus is a fair film that has an okay cast which includes dax miller taryn reif kate fischer duncan regehr joel west matt borlenghi maureen larrazabal cris vertido susan africa archie adamos rolando santo domingo and malecio amayao the acting by the actors is fairly good the thrills are fairly good and some of it is surprising the movie is filmed fairly good as well same thing goes for the music the film is fairly interesting and the movie does keeps you going until the end this is a fairly thrilling film if you the the cast in the film monsters giant animal films horror thrillers mystery and interesting films then i recommend you to see this film today
oh an idiotic cheap with fake special creature is played by one guy in lame stupid dialogues are unbelievably bad and these simply example i have never seen so annoying characters like in this dumb kids or pregnant woman with his husband and many in is a great entertainment if you're it like the i don't think so
my husband rented this from a video store thinking it was suspense never reads the it would be funny if the thing was watchable it simply isn't the same thing over and over no intrigue and where did they find the leading man the leading man michael des barres is not even feasibly good-looking especially for this role he is given also sexual harassment at work is something if you want to see rent michael disclosure at least michael douglas looked good in the early paul who is usually watchable plays an embarrassing scene here there are also lighting effects cheaper than your at home web cam don't even waste time renting this
i sat through almost one episode of this series and just couldn't take anymore it felt as though i'd watched dozens of episodes already and then it hit nothing new here i've heard that joke on seinfeld i saw someone fall like that on friends an episode of happy days had almost the same storyline ect none of the actors are interesting here either some were good on other shows here and others are new to a profession they should have never entered avoid this stinker
i believe in keeping religion out of government and out of the movies when i want a sermon i'll go to church but i don't want one from a movie i don't mind some supernatural themes all religion is about as supernatural as you can get but this movie had so much preaching in it that i was really annoyed the landlady reminded me of witches that of seen in other movies the bad guy even looked like he had horns what a silly ending the hero went into the meeting and yelled at all of those old men and that broke the spell if only life were that simple i think that when movies are that stupid they ought to be distributed with a warning danger preaching contained herein
somebody could probably make a great documentary about the jerry springer show but this fictionalized version merely succeeds in draining anything authentic and interesting out of the trash-tv phenomenon there are dozens of famously bad movies manos the hands of fate that show more creativity and spirit than this dreary witless waste of why not a documentary about the jerry springer show that would begin to answer some of the real questions like who are these people what happens to their lives after they appear on this show how did the mayor of cincinatti find himself good line during an orientation session for guests people i can't emphasize this enough no weapons
you know the kids alone in the starts cutting them this crap is no bunch of kids return to a cabin where the male leads twin brother disappeared for years an unkown creature stars cutting them their only help is a say this film was bad is an smut the acting was creature looked very cheesy and as all films do these days they try to get you with a twist they do is one bright spot to this lost star maggie grace as the female lead
i love zombie-movies and i love amateur-productions and meat market starts really promising with a nice homage to classic i leaned back and waited to be impressed okay some of the makeups are great for such a no budget movie and some actors vampirelady and the cook really stand out but else expect a new romero here but there is not one sequence in the whole movie which has even a little bit of suspense or shock value the director sure knows how to stage body rippings and interesting eating habits but now two parts time to learn something gore rhymes with bore for me not enough out of
major payne was really not very good at all despite being funny here and there the story was ridiculous and the acting was poor major voice and temperament were especially annoying the idea was ridiculous and the things that the boys had to do in that film were even more ridiculous i would not recommend this film to anyone
i read the back of the box and it talked about mary shelley and percy shelley and lord byron i thought wonderful this will be great i was so wrong the story was all screwed up in fact i still don't get it it just seems to me that all the characters did was drink smoke and have sex not that those aren't good movie qualities but please where was the story i made myself finish the movie and yes it did pick up towards the end but by then the movie was almost over rent it if you really want to just don't trust the back of the box
i have grown up with scooby doo all my life my dad grew up with scooby doo we have just watched the first episode of the travesty that calls itself shaggy and scooby get a clue what planet are warner bros on allowing this shambles to air the characters could have been drawn better by my younger sister the story could have been better written by my year old twin cousins are scooby doo fans too scooby and shaggy just aren't if anyone but casey kasem does the voice of shaggy it just isn't gonna work folks trust program was disgraceful new scooby doo is much better why change a winning format bin this piece of garbage and go back to the true scooby
in an otherwise ghastly misbegotten would-be oedipal was the lone victim at a screening tonight days after the movie opened so there is some satisfaction in knowing that moviegoers heeded bloom is off jon rose the emerging double chin isn't his fault but rehashing his geeky kid shtick in another bad wig simply isn't working it would be another crime if this were to be eli last screen appearance diane keaton will probably survive having taken this paycheck basically because so few will have seen her in this the very worst vehicle chosen in the last few alone in the theater tonight i came alive even whenever daniels was given the latitude in which to deliver the sole three dimensional character he really is among our very best summary even jeff work can't redeem this picture
clich√©-ridden story of an impending divorce or is it through the eyes of a year-old child corny dialogue cardboard characters stock situations a red herring zombie sub-plot and worst of all absolutely no payoff either emotionally or no-one teach creative writing any more the true sign of a weak storyteller when you cannot create any kind of satisfying denouement just end the story i'm compelled to ask what made you think this was a story worth telling in the first place but wasted debut by child actor anthony de marco the rest of the cast was at best forgettable and they wonder why no-one watches indie films this is ninety minutes of my life i will never get back
i gave this a there are so many plot twists that you can never be sure to root for total mayhem everyone gets killed or nearly so i am tired of cross hairs and changing views i cannot give the plot away convoluted and insane if i had paid to see this i would demand my money back i wish reviews were more honest
the lack of content in this movie amazed me the most first i though that people was going to compare this to rock on but i'm really surprised myself to say that this was worst than rock on so-so story horrible cast ajay devgan jamming with salman khan and asin you gotta be kidding me the music was okay khanabadosh was the track of the movie the rest was bad vipul shah hasn't still learn from singh is critically bashed comedy now asin where do she come from sorry for fan out there but she big time in this movie seriously bad acting she didn't look good at all overdose of make-up my final verdict go watch aladin with your family instead wasting your time here
this is the worst movie i have ever seen i was going to get up and leave at tape but i stuck it out i now consider myself a masochist afghanistan come on guys the idiot who forgot to hide the sanskrit billboards i thought the lead calil was particularly inept apart from the bad acting and over zealous camera shake i thought using the events of as a reason to make larson the lunatic implodes all over a screen near you disgraceful and irreverent to the victims of using a phone call from wife sarah supposedly from one of the terrorist held planes on that day was appalling the camera shake didn't make me feel sick that cold hearted stunt did
if you want to learn the basics of quantum mechanics spend your on a used textbook not this movie i'm a little worried that the money i spent is being used to buy kool-aid for shipment to guyana don't think the directors really got any point across but it looks like maybe they were trying to make several science can explain everything we do meaning that our lives are deterministic science can't be used to explain everything we do meaning that we have free will science is like really cool brother we are god the world exists only in our minds sarah norman is a tough role to follow and here put this tiny paper square in your mouth and you'll see some really groovy stuff
because this was simply awful dalamatians was funny even if formulaic but this is nothing more than puerile drivel the same plot except with the story excised from it the most intelligent and horribly annoying macaw tim mcinnerny proving that he really can't do comedy remembers percy in blackadder but that was his high spot all been downhill since then direction so poor that if a group of college students had made this you'd throw it in the bin and tell them to do it again properly this time ieuan grufford better go back to hornblower sharpish whilst glenn close and gerard diepardieu ought to go into hiding for several i could be too harsh after all i didn't manage to sit through the whole film it gets only because i can't give it
the premise of this movie was decent enough but with sub par acting it was just bland and the film does not work because of the nature of the death it was accidental so although it was a murder it wasn't like the guy set out to do it also through some flashbacks there is a secret that is revealed that sort of makes the events like justice to a degree there is no emotion in this film the first minutes or so is just this woman calling her sister and hearing her message it was dull and some polishing and better acting it could have been pretty good
ugh where to begin first campbell non-stop angst becomes a real turn-off after awhile very short while as he internalizes his mounting anguish curiosity and anger only we don't care these characters as presented by the writer and director are wholly unlikable and therein lies the key they haven't given us anything to make us care if they are adulterous and whether or not they are still in love with one another when scott quietly tells his wife i could kill you before their three daughters at the dinner table after the shock of his selfishly poor timing wore off i almost wished that he then done the same thing to the smug wisecracking apparition of denis leary before being hauled off the the looney bin an utter waste of time and
just utter trash i'm a huge fan of the cusacks this being the sole reason i watched this movie but the only reason i can see for their presence was the reprise in complete and depth less quality their exact roles from grosse point blanc apart from that the films role as a political satire fails miserably as being too obvious for even the most moronic out there to serve any purpose and to bill it as a satirical satire would be just plain insulting even to chimps imitation is apparently the highest form of flattery but seeing as though this is nothing near grosse point blanc and in the same league as meet the if your a moron spartans in terms of political satire lets leave well enough alone and let this one fade into the obscurity it absolutely deserves
the bad news is still really dreadful i gave it a because occasionally some of this kitchy slapstick parody actually seems supposed to be better than mulva zombie ass kicker and progress should be rewarded or maybe i was drinking heavily when i watched it and felt generous whatever it the best thing about this movie is that over pretty quick it takes elements from most of kill bill i key themes and fight scenes hacks them up dumbs them way down dirties up the dialog and squishes the whole mess into about an hour of truly awful amateur best smoke a lot of something powerful if you want to enjoy this one and get this dvd back to the video store on time you'll really hate yourself if you have to pay a late fee
i'll give william gove credit for finding someone to finance this ill-conceived thriller a good argument for not wasting money subscribing to hbo let alone buying dvds based on cover art and blurbs a pedestrian dennis hopper and a game richard grieco add nothing significant to their resumes although the art direction is not half bad the dialogue will leave you grimacing with wonder at its conceit this is storytelling at its worst no tension no suspense no dread no fear no empathy no catharsis no nothing a few attractive and often nude females spice up the boredom but this is definitely a film best seen as a trailer i feel sorry for the guy who greenlighted this thing good for late-night zoned-out viewing only you have been warned
if i could give this film a real rating it would likely be in the minus numbers while i respect the fact that somebody has to keep making these terrible horror films seriously people buying a ticket for this film is a waste of money you could be spending on something far more worth your it being a horror film there is nothing scary about it unless the idea of seeing how many horror you can fit in one movie scares you if the rating had been higher it probably would have made for a better film in the long made this version of prom night you screwed up the actors could probably have done a decent job if it weren't for the questionable scripting this was a terrible waste of a cinema trip i'd sooner go and see one missed call again at least that had some plot
miraculously this is actually quite watchable i mean bad really bad but whereas the original was bad this is bad right enough faint praise production values are rotten across the board the acting is excruciating and the romero-wannabe satire can't make its mind up which side of the ecology fence mocking internal logic takes a back seat to heads propelling themselves out of fridges virus incubation times fluctuating as the plot requires bullets working against the zombies or not zombies having the power of speech or not gore is the draw obviously but the framework is so slapdash annoying the dialogue sounds like been translated by the same computers that mangle instruction manuals and the scale of the zombie infestation is implied with none of the ingenuity of films all topped off with a horrendous synth score absolute rubbish
what was an exciting and fairly original series by fox has degraded down to meandering tripe during the first season dark angel was on my weekly must see list and not just because of jessica the powers-that-be over at fox decided that they needed to fine-tune the plotline within episodes of the season opener they had totally lost me as a viewer even to see jessica alba i found the new characters that were added in the second season to be too ridiculous and amateurish the new plotlines were stretching the continuity and credibility of the show too thin on one of the second season episodes they even had max sleeping and dreaming where the first season stated she biologically couldn't moral of the story one that hollywood never gets if it works don't screw with
this movie is not only poorly scripted and directed but is simply distasteful a beautiful novel is terribly misrepresented in this film many changes have been made to the storyline presumably to streamline the timeframe but what results is simply confusing the acting can't possibly overcome the script which removes the characters motives for their behavior plus the conversion to english does not work when everyone refers to the patriarch esteban as esteban horrible please please please read the gorgeous novel in spanish if possible don't see this film it will ruin for you what could be a wonderful experience
okay if you've seen the ring you've basically seen the grudge trying to be scary by just having freaky camera work and loud sounds but it fails miserably the plot if you can call it that is weak and rather full of holes for instance how would the care center have known that yoko didn't show up for work when the people who lived in the house were not there and not really clear what bill character had to do with anything he just kind of came out of nowhere to advance the plot it didn't make a lot of sense what happened to the original family who was hanging in the room the little boy or the dad and was yoko alive or dead when the care center guy found her there were too many unanswered questions and i was too bored to think about it more
for loyal duran duran fans who want to watch a good music video skip this one the producers decided to get creative and make this video something of a sci-fi story involving the evil barbarella villain from which the band got its name makes this idea fail is that right in the middle of some great duran duran songs confusing and annoying cut scenes take place showing the fictional antagonist trying to stop the band at one of their concerts not only is the good music repeatedly interrupted but we have to suffer through some cheap spin-off story hosted by an evil dr mario almost too much to bear
this movie was boring i swear i almost died from boredom at the theater it wasnt funny and didnt really hve that much action in it either it was boring and i hope whoever out there that liked this movie god be with you in the future when you find out what this movie was really like and try to jump off a bridge or something like that
the plot was dull the girls were sickening and the supposed italian male lead had clearly never heard an italian said the boys were cute in this film but it just seemed to be filled with mediocre people there were literally no redeeming features about this think this is a graveyard for actors that will never work again with the unfortunate exception of the olsen twins who seem to fascinate people for no discernible hope the olsen twins find something out of the limelight to keep them away from the entertainment business they have no place in it
ok so nudity but hey free porn on the internet for whomever likes it and its just silly how they forced tits into every frame i mean i was embarrassed not from the nudity but from the far-fetchessness of the of this piece of movie is not funny at all its just extremely predictable all the time there is no plot no dramatic content at all this is way waay worse then the other pie-films and they arnt that great either if you're really drunk or maybe a year old buy who are really obsessed with tits this might be acceptable otherwise not it forever roth align with crap of the same magnitude with regards erik the questmaster flash mc
horrendous avoid like the plague i would rate this in the top worst movies ever special effects acting mood sound etc appear to be done by day care i have seen programs better than this opens like a soft porn show with a blurred nude female doing a shower scene then goes bad from there good nude scenes but that is it sound and light problems were persistent throughout the movie at times i would swear i could hear the roaring of the camera motors yikes i would like to see another movie on this story but done by different people this batch of actors and crew need more acting and movie making lessons voted out of
i had the misfortune to sit through the full minutes of what in my opinion is this shockingly bad film it fails on pretty much all levels the cast is awful the acting ham at best and the plot lacks any depth leaving me feeling violently apathetic as to the outcome of any of the convoluted story b has none of the charm this genre has the scope to convey and i found myself physically cringing at the various points where the script makes its regular misjudged meanderings anywhere towards the region of bona fide saccharine coated turd of a movie
i rented this dvd for two reasons a cast of great actors and the director even though robert altman can be hit or miss in this case it was a big miss attempt at creating suspense fell on its keester after seeing kenneth branagh in a good film like dead again i didn't think he could possibly contribute to such a turkey and i hope it didn't ruin his reputation robert duvall seems to have fallen the way of most one-time oscar winners on a downward spiral that includes acting in eating-money films such as this one duvall was once a great actor in excellent films even though his best performance was not tender mercies but the great santini this movie was truly a big waste of time i give it a out of
i mean i thought i heard this dialog in the movie but it was so bad and out of place that i can't really believe it i was laughing so hard at what must have been the worst writing and acting in human history i was seriously worried that i might have a heart attack and die right there in the this is the scene i am talking about the hero just watched his brother crash and his brothers car exploded right there just feet away from him hero the hero was throwing the expected fit at seeing something so tragic and people were trying to hold him back from running into the burning the middle of his fit and his uncontrollable break down he says i am so sad he said that right am i crazy
higher learning says its ok for blacks to torment white people because they're all oppressors most blacks in this movie are portrayed as ignorant savages stunning that this is supposed to be a positive movie about race incompetent acting direction and production values all contribute to this toothache of a flick an appalling piece of trash the perpetrators of this dreck should be ashamed higher learning says its ok for blacks to torment white people because they're all oppressors most blacks in this movie are portrayed as ignorant savages stunning that this is supposed to be a positive movie about race incompetent acting direction and production values all contribute to this toothache of a flick an appalling piece of trash the perpetrators of this dreck should be ashamed
what did stanley kramer see in adam novel and very puzzling screenplay were there a few pieces left out on purpose and what about gene hackman richard widmark edward albert eli wallach and mickey rooney what did they see in this very muddled why did candice bergen who gave a horrible performance accept such a thankless domino principle wants to be on the same footing as the parallax view or the manchurian candidate and misses the mark by a very wide margin a major misfire by stanley kramer
for that matter one of the worst films ever made plot goes as follows slog through jungle looking areas for minutes or so have bo go somewhere and strip slog through the jungle some more give bo another excuse to strip back to the jungle oh look a tarzan looking guy strip bo strip kill the safari people tarzan looking guy has a fight scene saves bo bo strips run credits run credits run
i've been watching this movie by hoping to find a pretty and interesting story yet the story line wasn't good at all the play of the actors weren't any course shahrukh khan was there yet he wasn't enough to make this movie credible and read that this movie was based on the novel of flaubert madame bovary yet for me i didn't see it matching with the indian general we buy movie to dream and have a good time not to waste our time and change our mood into worse i just can't understand how it could get such a high vote with an average of the kind of movie you should run away ignore because there is nothing to appreciate in it you will just waste your time unless if you like dark movie with strange and non sense story
firstly i am not easily scared by anything except for my few phobias but this movie is absolutely horrific this is not appropriate for children at all i had my mouth open the whole time it just shocked me i couldn't believe how gory it was for a movie bunnies being brutally murdered just unnecessary to be so horrifying and be rated g i recommend being over to see this but don't get me wrong it was probably a good movie if i wasn't scarred mentally as a child i cannot believe a parent would allow a say year old child to watch this just to intense and complicated not to forget gory for young kids i'm wayy over and i was shocked by the violence i don't recommend
this film is so ridiculously idiot that you may actually laugh at it but no even this is too much for this lost meters of celluloid i found it as an offer in a magazine and why i've seen it i regret the time i lost to see this out of they don't have a lower grade
i have seen this movie at the cinema many years ago and one thing surprised me so negatively that i could not see any redeeming virtues in the movies dennis quaid was cast as a policeman that never smiles or grin while his smile and grin are two of his trademarks danny glover was cast as the bad guy but again most viewers imagination could not go far enough as to believe him in that role also jared leto was not believable as the former medicine student the tension was just not there since the killer was known very early the finale was again neither dramatic nor tense nobody around me cared about what was going to happen next all we could wait for was the end of the movie all in all a disappointing evening spent at the cinema
this why do they have to make movies that they must know from the beginning i mean look at alien from if the movie about to make is not better than anything made billions of years before why make it i had problems with the plot and who the main character was not good either
yet another son who won't grow up flick and just the other recent like entries heder in another bad wig channeling napoleon for what the third time anna faris is forgettable as always jeff daniels phoned this one in from another state at least and diane does one become typecast this late in a career do not bother nothing is said here that hasn't been covered many times over i will say this about a hundred times better than failure to launch there are very few amusing bits in the movie unless you think eli wallach cursing is funny ha ha old and he dropped the f-bomb tee hee hee pitiful
this was far and away the worst movie i've ever seen in my entire life it was slow boring not scary not funny not dramatic not michelle gellar was up to her old playbook of empty expressions of fright and shock she couldn't sell her character nor could anyone else in the those who thought the grudge was kind of alright then don't go see this unless you get enjoyment out of wasting your time and your saw this movie for free by the way so i don't want this to come across as a rant from a guy that lost bucks on a terrible movie it was free it still sucked i hated
i saw this in the theater when it came out and just yesterday i saw it again on cable this i was able to reacquainted myself with the feeling of just how revolting this film is the whole bunch of characters are self-absorbed narcisstic preeners worst of all it reinforces every negative stereotype about dating even as it purports to celebrate people finding themselves the nice guys finish last the jerky guys make out great the jerkiest guys do best the girls are all boy toy pushovers only one character is seen doing anything remotely useful to society and she dispenses with her long-saved virginity in a throwaway one-night stand with a scumbag in a lushly filmed scene that we're supposed to think is romantic what this really is is concept of young america permissive detached promiscuous conceited
scary but mostly in the sense that will it be over before i turn i saw this as a late night re-run in about and thought it would never end like crackers better than nothing milland is a little scary because he looks as if been stuffed by a taxidermist yvette mimeux looks as if smoked up all the beautiful downtown burbank brown a sort of roy rogers version of baby this is one turkey that should never have been made if you have insomnia and on saturday morning and nothing on but replays of the roller derby chamionship then i guess it beats that but god help you if this is your only choice for entertainment
i couldn't bear to sit through he entire movie do families like this really exist somewhere there have been many comments describing this family as akin to llbean models and such and i think that that is a great description of how they absurdly unbelievable occurs as we meet a character referred to in high school as pigface who of course has grown into a drop-dead gorgeous harvard-educated plastic surgeon only to do good in the world-not for the money and she beds steve carrel on the first date when i quit you can completely suspend your disbelief for two hours then perhaps you'll enjoy this sentimental self-indulgent waste of time
this movie was craptacular i was so emotionally uninvolved in every single character that the movies biggest antagonist was in fact myself i played it beautifully throughout promising myself i would walk away but only drinking another beer hoping it would auto-magically transform into something engrossing along the way even in this state i couldn't help but notice that acting was as flimsy as tracing paper his obsessive dedication to his job was unconvincingly done as well as his one night binge after the failure of his own idiot standards burt came on the screen as a general right a general wears too much makeup i fell into a frighteningly fast binge to rival except mine was real and i stubbed my toe recompense recompense my stubbed toe
i was in such high hopes of seeing an adaptation of a classic story like the arabian nights instead i was disappointed in a film that failed to keep my attention from the very beginning even though i tried watching it twice was a bonus that caradine was in this movie but it didn't amount to much as the actors lacked likability for something a little similar zorro with anthony hopkins and bandaras is much better for action comic moments and overall so son of the dragon has many possible fans out there but if your looking for something to wow about in terms of martial arts and plot line you wont get it if you just want the kids to settle down on a sunday afternoon then maybe this it for you along with the ninjas
creepy lascivious wolf the young red is wearing full make-up and extremely short shorts robe got about minutes through and realized it could be a dream come true the up-beat music sounds a lot like something i'd hear at a strip club i actually think this movie is a sick joke not a family movie gross glad i was watching this with my daughter i don't want her to think normal for families to view quasi kiddie porn together very bad very sad sold as a family film joey fatone will probably be embarrassed he was in it and with advertising it as a special effects spectacular the effects do look low budget gawd awful
this movie makes no sense at all there are plot holes big enough to drive enormous nypd vehicles through the characters do not act in any plausible way whatsoever i will put my comments in the chat board but save your time and money this is stupid i can't stand when hollywood spends millions of dollars on flash bang equipment and uses fancy editing and cool music and does not bother to have a plot that hangs together at even the most basic level but it is nice to see denzel w prevail over the man who comes in flavors jodi foster mayor bloomberg and capt von trapp there is even a sweet little kid with a video game who is nice
this appalling film somehow saw the light of day in it looks and sounds as if it had been produced or years earlier and features some of the worst songs ever included in a major motion picture i weep for the parents and children who paid top dollar to see this
this programme bugs me there is no humour to it and is far too serious to be called fun just far too educational for my liking the characters are very stereotyped and unappealing the plots are redundant and the morals are just repeated over and over again the fun in it also i feel this has been on the bbc for far too long and is broadcast way too much does it really need to have a slot on every or months when a brand new show runs out of episodes i think time that the bbc starting bringing back some of their older shows like inspector gadget bananaman the smurfs snorks moomins the raccoons and count duckula other than continually giving contracts to these newer shows i thought the bbc where bring back danger mouse so going on with that
when i first started watching this movie i was looking for some kind of subtle metaphors but it soon dawned on me that this movie was indeed about people on a train the interactions between people are like those you can see any day on the street and when in occasion there is a slightly more interesting situation the dialogue becomes stilted and boring its not that i don't get how this film is trying to portray the way people interact just that in this film they are very boring if you want to see and analyse these kinds of relationships you'd be best to actually go out and buy a train ticket and look at the people on the train with you it is realistic but you wouldn't go to a movie to watch a film about you sitting there watching the movie
a typical goth chick harvest looking like a cross between winona ryder in beetlejuice and boy george gets even with people she feels have wronged her with the help of an old haunted mirror that she finds in the new house she and her mom mainstay karen black the only remotely good thing about this travesty buy the pretty laughably bad when rainbow interacts with the aforementioned mirror and there are no scares or suspense to be had this film inexplicably spawned thus for sequels each slightly more atrocious than the last people looking for a similarly themed but far superior cinematic endeavor would be well advised to just search out the episode of friday the the series where a geeky girl finds an old cursed compact mirror that packs more chills in scant minutes than this whole franchise has provided across grade d candy charlie spradling provides the obligatory
this movie was seriously awful the acting was the worst it was worse than a student film super cheesy and i think the worst actor was the old lady at first i thought to myself well an old movie then i remembered that that is no excuse i've seen older movies with way better acting and music was terrible to it was really choppy the editing was poor of the dialog was out of this movie doesn't even deserve a i only watched it because i was so bored and the movie hardly entertained me it was just laughable my dead left pinkie toe could make a better movie than this
eddie delirious is completely and totally rude crude crass and lude this is indeed the only way to describe this appalling trashy piece of stand-up eddie murphy goes for shock value rather than laughs to try and win his following over he does manage to be funny occasionally but mostly loses the plot with obscene language and distasteful sex it unless you happen to enjoy foul style i don't think i will bother with eddie murphy raw i much prefer eddie in the confines of a movie january video
good lord whoever made this turkey needs to be buried alive i'm sorry but the other reviewer must not have seen this movie he must be watching something else or have never seen a movie before out of ten stars saying what this is as good as ben hur or gone with the wind unintentionally funny massively unbelievable characters absurd situations looks like it was shot in griffith park works out pretty was shot in griffith park crappy script just about everything that could possibly be wrong with a movie all rolled into one package should be required viewing for all prospective film makers as an example of how a movie could be horribly wrong it reminds me of something a usc student may make for a film class this one a pass unless you do drugs and are into high camp
this could be a cute movie for kids my grandson watched it once he was watching it a second time i was watching some of it with the little bear gets lost on the ice burg and he is in the water he is trying to get to a piece of ice it says come back stupid ass don't want my year old grandson watching movies with words like this in is why its rated for children should be child friendly that is what i would expect put out by warner brothers and g rated i would expect this to not have cuss words in it the words don't even fit the movie in most places as it seems added later and the movie drags out in many parts
let me confess i found this video used and bought it because guttenberg looked so sexy in his underwear on the jacket but inside was another story besides the fact that the movie was basically a parody of invisible-man genre special effects visible strings and other such paraphernalia the script wasted no chance in fact it went out of its way in insulting all non-wasp races and real-or-imagined homosexuals every insult aimed at a person in the script was either homophobic or racist or both it starts to grate on your nerves along with the shaky sound camera style photography and melodramatic story however the end is somewhat of a surprise but by the time you get there you hardly care less too bad it could been a reasonably good movie
i feel like i'm the only kid in town who was annoyed by performance he is a fine actor by most accounts but he simply could not pull off the southern accent i mean it was deplorable it was as if he was trying too hard to be a yank one of the previous reviewers questioned why actors were not cast in this film i second that notion wonderful when wish to expand their horizons but another thing to try too hard so that a performance becomes strained maybe it was altman but a such a great i really don't want to bash branagh for his absolutely hideous accent too much everybody deserves to screw up here and there but it is hard to watch something so annoying that you'd rather choke on a chicken bone or eat a bucket full of crap than sit through the gingerbread man
well what was fun except for the fun my second least favorite so far i even thought it was worse than lazarus and ghost in the start with the good the teaser it was incredibly well done and also emotional being the great animal lover that i am it was fun seeing so many beautiful animals in this then all the bad and believe me there is a lot of it little made sense so those animals were being abducted by aliens and impregnated whaaa the dialog was also pretty awful there were about one or two quotable lines worst of all having pretty much all those animals die was very unpleasant for me in the end the point they all pretty much died we didn't learn anything we weren't entertained and i couldn't even find death sad just very star shame because season was doing so well
i'm watching this on the sci-fi channel right now so horrible i can't stop watching it i'm a videographer and this movie makes me sad i feel bad for anyone associated with this movie some of the camera work is good most is very questionable there are a few decent actors in the flick too bad they're surrounded by what must have been the relatives the only way they could have been qualified to be in a movie music was a little better than the acting if you get around to watching this i hope because there was absolutely no other option the sequel sequel is coming on think i'll skip it jason
i would have rated this film a minus but sadly it is not i didn't walk out in the first five minutes of this movie i cannot say i should have gone with my instinct and left immediately several people in our theater did and sadly i didn't follow them story lacked all criteria for a movie no plot awful acting even robin williams was so disappointing that i may never see another film he is in not a single relationship in the story went beyond parlor talk i did like the tazer scene too bad it didn't shock some meat into the senselessness of the plot someone needs to tazer the writer and director of this film
return of the boogyman is a dreadful movie which doesn't play like a movie it plays like an episode of a tv sitcom when they flashback to older episodes return of the boogyman is just a clip of the film is constant and annoying flashbacks from the first movie over and over again the same footage how boring this movie really is about a psychic woman who has visions of the first have seen the first movie i don't want to see the same scenes over and over again and i don't know who would the whole movie looks like it was quickly made to make a few bucks and thats it
we went to the movie with a group because the play we were going to was cancelled it is without doubt one of the worst movies ever it is not that i don't like cult-movies i do but nothing happens in the film one does not feel any connection with the characters whatsoever endless times without dialog and the car how do thay carry a huge tent and beds chairs and clothing for every day in that car it is a two seater i have to say however the scenery is beautiful but not in a movie the director should have made a photoshoot of the movie so that we could skip about minutes of useless time in with nothing happens i would not recommend it as it is a waste of your time
why me why should i be subjected to such slaughter of what could have made an interesting plot at least if i can warn other people off it will have been had to watch this horrible movie for a college course otherwise i would have looked at the synopsis on the back of the thing and steered clear the movie was slow had painfully little character development and centered around the idea that a creepy little white man can become cool if he hangs out with an la-style token black you want to experience the stereotypical la feeling of dizzying superficiality watch the movie note though that this movie does not depict what we have come to think of as an la lifestyle it is a wonderful example of the products that arise from it
this stuffy melodrama is quite easily the worst film starring ingrid bergman that i've seen even her luminous screen presence can't save this insufferably slow and meandering movie nearly impossible to sit through without fast-forwarding a lot of for die-hard bergman fans others are very likely to fall asleep i suggest you to watch for whom the bell tolls instead
this is one seriously disturbed movie even though the boys deserved some of what they sadistic gruesome executions were slightly over the top the only character showing some conscience early in the hunt was killed off before he could offer some help to the sad the beginning of the movie there looked to be some promise of a mediocre affair but this was just a ploy to lull the viewers into a false sense of security before the joy of what was to come only thing that could have saved the movie for me was if jack nicholson had jumped out of the bushes and yelled and where is the batman kim basinger could have screamed that would have been cool
i was talked into watching this movie by a friend who blubbered on about what a cute story this want my two hours back as i could have done so many more productive things with my for instance twiddling my thumbs i see nothing redeeming about this film at all save for the eye-candy aspect of being generous
this movie does not really promote kids to be nicer and have better attitudes as a family movie should and this wouldn't be considered family anyway because it has some things in it that children shouldn't be seeing not the best abc family film if you ask me if there were less sexual themes in the movie then maybe it would be better hollywood isn't doing anything to make a movie better by adding in sexual situations really no reason for them at least this is a tv movie i wouldn't want to waste my money on this garbage by renting it if you have other things to do other than watch this movie please proceed to them
hak hap or black mask english was a disappointment i was told that it was a sort of japanese version of the matrix imagine my disappointment the film was either badly dubbed or the soundtrack didn't time well with the film another thing is that the dialogue was pretty much bad there was very little thought put into the english version of this film and it appeals only to the senseless action genre not a film i would want to see again
first thing first in this genre movie the first thing you need is a good music and thats where mr shankar and his party is completely pale and uneffective on other hand there is ajay devgan who has removed a letter a from his spelling done good job but was of no use to a bad casted movies like is like a doll which is used to amuse public even though she is good to look at but her role in movie is to dance actually she is dancing member of a rock band and i don't think any rock band have there dancer as a member of nut shell this movie is a piece of crap a piece of watch it if you wanna get fooled
why did the histories of mary and rhoda have to be so dour divorced women with indifferent daughters and why very little reference to the original show and characters the daughter characters were silly and uninteresting why can't there ever be daughters who like their on tv it makes sense that mary would leave minneapolis and rhoda would return to nyc but why couldn't phyllis or sue ann nivens be guest stars it just seems a pitiful way to remember such wonderful characters it was good to see mary and rhoda together of course but it could have been better much better well there has been a mary tyler moore show reunion a dick van dyke show reunion hopefully mary will do better next time if she revisits her old mary richards stomping grounds again
how can you gather this respectable cast of young british actors and come up with such a pile of filmic manure horrible script annoyingly hectic camera awfully edited gruesomely badly acted only rhys ifans tries to fill his role with life another painful proof that different sometimes equals dreck why do the money people fail to read the scripts beforehand do yourself a favour spare yourself and do something else like hitting a mallet onto your knees less painful and more fun than this movie
what an awful movie i love monster flicks but i couldn't watch even half of the terrible acting cardboard characters and abysmal special effects there is nothing redeeming about this movie the characters come from either an endless supply of suicidally stupid cannon fodder or else they are vacuous uninspiring sock puppets the plot is formulaic cut and paste standard science-run-amok drivel even the cgi is horrible you know bad when you can't even depend on the movie to provide some good eye candy no surprises same old same old this is truly one of the worst films ever made director roger corman should be hung from a lightpost so that children can use him as a pinata
as a former kalamazoo resident with a fondness for the town i was looking forward to seeing this movie but what a disappointment although the acting and the production values aren't bad the script is awful the plot is unrealistic and the theme is main message of this film is that women are nothing without husbands and children i can hardly believe how regressive it is in view of women has the writer been living under a rock i enjoyed seeing my beloved city on the big screen i wouldn't suggest this movie to anyone terrible an embarrassment to the city named after
this was a really funny in the movie was trying to be serious that is what made this movie so funny i mean come on a head on a human body can it get any funnier good job sci-fi keep the comedy movies coming i never thought movies could get anymore retarded if they keep it up they will have to rename the sci fie channel the comedy sci fi channel or something like cant wait the next blockbuster movie from sci be ready with a bowl of popcorn and a case of beer or a bottle of liquor and ill be ready to laugh it up again
i've found the movie offensive for americans which lost somebody in the towers for american people in general pretending to be an homage to horrible facts happened last years each director takes the opportunity to polemize with old facts have none to do with a terrorist attack or criticize political behaviour or compare different political situation as they have in own country having this nothing to do or to share with the atrocity of september shame on them
a cast of tv movie and tv series guest stars rowe pamela little seymour cassel among several the story of a photographer who has dreams about killing his models of course the models and other people start turning up dead causing all sorts of done not very good thriller has enough nudity and violence to get an r rating but not enough good material to engender any real interest this is best described as the sort of movie that gave the cable channel cinemax the alternate name of skinamax i really can't see the point of watching this unless you need to see every sleazy thriller out there also have to comment that this film is filled with smoking to the point that it becomes laughable when anyone lights up
i didn't know it was possible to release a movie this bad the labeling sounded so promising but you would think that with a cast of at least one of them would be able to act my wife left me and went to bed after the first minutes she made a wise decision
don't let the title trick you into watching this movie i read the title saw that it came on in the middle of the night and figured it was one of those soft porn movies this movie is bad if you like soft porn movies then i'm sorry to say this isn't one there are a lot of sex but nothing shown and they only last for seconds or so
ah channel of local mexican everyday at they air horror movies from the to early it was return to cabin by the lake the movie that aired yesterday i regret for watching original cabin by the lake was a regularly popular low budgeter and it was good accepted the problem is that this sequel is horrible not even unintentionally funny and tries to imitate the original ugh the plot is really stupid in all the sense of the movie at some points looks like a soap-opera because of absurd dialogs cinematography and advice is avoid this one at all costs a movie that it shouldn't be watched by anyone not even for lovers of mediocre have been warned
i tried to finish this film three times but god awful case in point mom and daughter drive up to the bed and stops for gas crazy gas station weirdos mad at her hubby whose running the try to rape her she escapes heads to and instead of hubby going ballistic and she wanting to call the cops story just continues with lukewarm behavior on both their parts action logic deficits abound acting is also lukewarm and the next door warning is delivered in a really corny badly acted of intense unevenly interwoven with lukewarm scenes of time-filler interplay between focus on gore more focus on mood and story would have been appreciated
they sell it as a horror movie supposed to be a thriller but i found it pretty funny don't think so i laughed the whole movie i think it was because of the ridiculous acting and plot i don't blame the actors i think they were not very good but i think cillian is a very good bad guy i loved his acting in batman beggins and rachel mcadams whoa a beauty and a good actress as well but try to be a little objective here the story mm mm the direction mm mm it lacks a lot of good suspense in fact is a really boring movie but one good thing tho a short movie only hour and minutes me it was like minutes under the just don't know why this movie is rated so high and in rotten tomatoes even higher wrong with good rational and objective criticism
the john goodman program was pretty awful but this thing just plain stinks the one and only thing in this mess that made me smile was recognizing the voice of patrick starfish as frosty the story is hopeless written by somebody who has garbled memories of childhood rebelliousness but has never gained any adult sense of perspective in the intervening years paranoia rules the dark world that these characters inhabit everybody is unpleasant and for no reason the plot is predictable but the show lurches from one inexplicable unconnected scene to another in such a pointless way there is no fun in watching it the worst thing is nobody in the production crew seems to have ever seen snow
sloppily directed witless comedy that supposedly spoofs the classic alien invasion films but really is no better than them except of course in the purely technical department makeup effects and any spoof that is worse than its target is doomed to fail royale our man flint are worse than almost any james bond movie after two hours of hearing the screeching voices of the aliens you'll be begging for some peace and quiet
i went to see this film with fairly low expectations figuring it would be a nice piece of fluff sadly it wasn't even that i could barely sit through the film without wanting to walk out i went with my two kids and and even they kept asking how much longer after lasting until the end i just kept wondering who would approve this script even the reliable fred willard couldn't save the trite dialogue the state jokes and the banal plot i'd suggest that whoever wrote and directed this movie use the term loosely should take an online screen writing class or drop by their local community college for a film class at the least there are many books on directing screen writing and producing movies that would teach them something about structure plot dialogue and pacing
there is absolutely nothing to redeem this movie they took a sleazy story miscast it miswrote it misfilmed it it has bad dialogue badly performed in a meandering and trashy badly as it fails as art it fails even worse as commerce who could have been the target market for this what age group what interest should make a movie about how and why they made this movie that i would pay to seen thousands of bad movies and this ranks with sailor who fell from grace and manos my choices as the three most unredeemably bad movies i've ever seen everybody associated with it should be forced to make conversation with vandamme for all challenge you watch this movie and perform an academic exercise how could you take this and make it worse i can't think of one way
first of all is not high tech any more and it is not a fighter the and cannot change their appearances they are not transformers the has only one cannon not two but not the least at the end of the film seagle selected sidewinder missile but somehow when he pulled the trigger the actual missile fired turned out to be a maverick as i have the experience of seeing and being mysteriously transformed into this small transformation of missiles is not a big surprise to me however there is still one question i have to ask how did they manage to use an air to ground missile to shoot down a flying students hand in really bad work teachers assign now i think for the sake of properly marking this film imdb should seriously consider adding a option otherwise it is not fair for those who receive out of
this movie makes a promising start and then gets very confused and muddled kamal hasan has made a lot of effort in getting the period look right pity he did not spend more time on the plot most of the small characters in the movie show up for no particular very disappointing i would recommend avoiding this movie
to summarize this movie without a real plot this movie consists of minutes of deranged characters either drinking or making bad jokes the music is just awful the humor isn't funny and all the female characters slutty idiots or total geeks it seems to me that the movie has actually been written by a year old boy who thinks that drinking is cool women are designed to please men and all that oppose that view are geeks also the movie has nothing to do with the original american pie movies other than a few names and mr levenstein who is a minor character in this one the only good thing about this movie are the nice looking girls don't watch this movie and don't be fooled by the rating because it obviously overrated and doesn't deserve anything above
all the bare chested women in the world couldn't keep me from hitting the stop button about a third of the way through this awful rubbish with the derisory acting equally terrible script plus the poor cgi fx to match this movie is an insult to the werewolf genre it is supposed to be serious which in itself would be funny if this film could even make it to the level of being a bad is one of those movies where the people behind the camera are obviously competent but are too lazy to make something even one quarter decent avoid at all costs and watch one of the classic werewolf movies out of
i went into watching this movie knowing it wasn't going to be great but what i witnessed was to awful for words i don't mean to be harsh its just the movie was terrible overall it had bad i mean awful special effects the acting wasn't too bad but wasn't good either and sasquatch himself was like well not sasquatch in my opinion the best sasquatch movie is harry and the hendersons its not violent or horror but it has the best depiction of sasquatch at least its a suit and not some half-ass cgi rip-off only see this movie if you are desperate or really appreciate anyone in the film or go watch boondock saints it is much better
early heavy war-time propaganda short urging people to be careful with their spending practices in effort to prevent any runaway scare guilt and patriotic jingoistic rhetoric which was normal for the time the government was concern that the sudden war-time production and therefore wage increase and subsequent spending practices if not checked could cause serious problems during and after the truly is a window into the past historically and culturally
living in the middle east israel i was excited when i bought my ticket for syriana having seen the trailer and being a thriller-lover i expected to see first of all a fast moving breath catching movie which wisely dips in global policy-making and the relation between oil power and corruption from a fresh angle well i almost left the movie in the middle the pace was painfully slow almost all characters were stereotyped the intertwined editing made understanding the logic very difficult but as steve rhodes wrote in his review in the end you don't care save your money save your time choose another chernitsky
this norwegian movie is so crap the actors can not act cause they seems to be reading from a book and the story is so only actor who did a ok job was haavard if you want a really good norwegian movie watch buddy great actors and a feelgood story
i tried to sit through this bomb not too long a disaster the acting was were some absolutely pathetic action scenes that fell flat as a lead was mainly due to the fact that the reactions of the actors just didn't ring a modern reworking of the hitchcock original think hictcock would be spinning circles in his grave at the very thought of what i was able to suffer is nothing compelling in this boasts a few semi big they put no effort into their be was fault pretty sure the script blew up in the first explosion is possible that this thing ends up improving as it goes for not willing to spend at least three days to find unless you have at least a three day weekend on the this
this is a movie about how men think women think about love no woman describes a one-night sexual encounter and declares it a love the ten monologues i felt only three really had any kind of truth ring through them i kept waiting for the film to get better and it did a bit but never better is an interesting concept and i kept wanting it to be good but it never succeeded maybe if they actually were love stories it would have worked
saw this movie recently and had higher hopes not so much based upon the director who hadn't made a cinematographic release before but more based upon its cast harvey keitel scott glenn and craig wasson role in body double a brian de palma masterpiece have all starred in great movies not together though and this fact hasn't exactly changed because of this film is unbelievable very predictable and clich√© the only thing that might make it slightly appealing is the selection of locations on which been shot in my humble opinion don't waste your time on this one
how can they from joe don baker bufford pusser in the first sequel to bo svenson bufford pusser in the second did they do that because bo svenon look more a like to bufford pusser they still should'nt of changed it because the first sequel it was joe don baker as bufford pusser and that one of the thing i wanted to see in the second would've given this movie a out of and i would've given it a out of if the story did'nt have anything to do with bufford life but it did and that why i had given this movie a out strongly suggest that anyone who is planning on watching this cheese i suggest don't and watch the first sequel instead
this verson doesn't mangle the bard that badly still a horrible minimalist production dutch uncle is inexplicably dubbed by a spaniard ricardo montalban or not is subject to debate and maximilian schell overacts like never before most of the dialogue makes it through unscathed and the fact that the version feels obliged to point out repeatedly that the speeches are long doesn't strike me as incredibly humorous mostly just bad acting though
whoever wrote the script for this movie does not deserve to work in hollywood at all even live there and those actors need to find another job the most dreadful hour and some minutes of my life and i only kept watching to see if it would get better which unfortunately for me it did at the end the credits gave me anxiety i guess there weren't a lot of people behind the movie so they had to roll the credits slowly very movie is definitely a great how not to make a movie guide too bad i can't give a
my one line summary should explain it all but i'll have a go at the get-go this movie seemed like an overdone soap opera and about all i can comment on there were a few interesting scenes such as the big one that hit during the middle of the movie but wait that the earthquake wait a minute peak well parts of it butchered and slapped in i can't believe how poorly this movie was done borrowing scenes from other much better films one wonders what director thought that viewers are dumb enough to believe large wooded mountain-esque backdrops exist in downtown la ala advise forget the bond wanna-be nash in this film and go for the real thing someone from peak
i've just lost hours of my life watching this mindless plot i could make a better movie with my cellphone camera how do they manage to get actors to play in those movies porn movies have better scenarios and effects i wish i had those hours only good thing about this movie is the cast even though their acting skills in this one could not lift this movie to passable the rest was just way too bad the type of movie that i'd recommend using to torture prisoners into scaring them worse i saw a translated version of this a bad an even worst
if movies like ghoulies rip off gremlins then hobgoblins sinks to the new low of ripping off garbage like ghoulies these barely-animated furbies have some kind of scheme to fulfill fantasies involve basically groteque characters sex dreams oh joy but what that has to do with anything is guess except to let the director indulge his kinky penchant for erotica they show this down in the circle of hell one suspects no real plot just goblins kill and feeble attempts at humor and a mild attempt to arouse the viewing audience
this movie is another fine example of what jerry bruckheimer since about seems to be best up a movie a year before its release and not coming through with a quality movie i'm no film critic but this movie was as predictable as they come every attempt at a joke every attempt at a touching moment and the pitiful attempt at a love story was exactly what i was predicting in my mind do yourself a favor and save your money on this one
warning spoilers following superb recreation of the base in antarctica where the real events of the film took place other than that libelous scandalous filmed in canada presumably by a largely canadian crew and cast i caught the last half of this film recently on global television here in canada nothing much to say other than how thoroughly appalled i was at what a blatant piece of american historical revisionist propaganda it is and starring susan sarandon of all people i can only assume that canadian born director roger spottiswoode was coerced to make the usaf the heroes of the film when in fact the real rescuers where a small private airline based in calgary kenn borek air
i saw this at the edinburgh film festival it was awful every clich√©d violent rich boy fantasy was on display you just knew how it was going to end especially with all the shots of the wife and the rape of the first worst part was the with the and they tried to come across as intellectuals but you could tell they're the types that get off on violence i bet anything they frequent brothels and do waste your time i had to keep my boyfriend from walking out of it
i wasted my time and gave this show a chance this has to be one of the worst new shows if they gave an award to shows that suck this one should sweep the category the acting is poor and the story line is contrived now dinosaurs was a bit strange but at least it was entertaining that show lasted three seasons and was finally scraped this new show based on an insurance companies commercials is not funny and really has nothing going for it possibly the original commercials and the amount of times they were and still are repeated is what is wrong with this show it just came to tv and already we are tired of seeing the caveman characters
from the mind of harry alan towers comes another piece of cinematic sludge supposedly based on the work of h rider haggard the only similarity it bears to anything haggard actually wrote is that it takes place in africa an africa that has dinosaurs which our intrepid adventurers use to pull their canoes and has some characters with the same heroes mccallum patrick mcnee and john colico set out to seek treasure armed only with a medallion and end up precisely where the treasure is purely by chance on the way they meet a motley assortment of extremely lame monsters pick up a french chef and mccallum has an affair with the queen of so ridiculous a hoot the only reason i didn't give it a
a top contender for worst film ever made joanna character seems to have an of which is only one less than the writer and director the screenplay would not have passed in a high school writing class the jokes are juvenile the concept corny these performers were obviously desperate for work i stayed to the end only to see if it would get worse it did life is too short to spend any part of it watching this film
a friend of mine lent this video to me and i was fairly excited to watch it but after ten minutes of james slow pitched vocals and lars banging on his drum set in what appeared to be slow motion i began to think am i watching this that question will be coursing through your minds in minutes after you hit play i gave the tape back the same day as you would suspect not worth buying or my
i stopped five minutes in when beowulf was given a double-shot automatic crossbow with sights on it not only do crossbows not have telescoping sights but beowulf beat grendel in hand-to-hand combat the terrible wooden acting and eternal darkness that plagues all sci-fi original movies didn't help either having only gotten a few minutes in before i felt my bile rise and decided to watch i love lucy reruns instead really about all i have to say but you might as well just realize that a made-for-tv movie and skip it right travesty
it does touch a few interesting points but it fails to show evidence of all the exclusive studies shown who are the friends and small groups of scientists that gathered this data up with all the al gore biography going on there like how he liked playing with the cows on the ranch or that his kid got hit by a car too bad but what does that have to do with the ozone seen much better stuff in much less time on discovery channel i really don't understand why this has such a high score on imdb unless you've been living under a rock this documentary shouldn't be any news to you all this is old news and all al gore is trying to do is get some popularity points i'm not american so don't even try saying that i'm a bush fan p
i was fooled to rent this movie by its impressive cover alas it is easily one of the worst movies ever made judging by the acting of the film characters more a comedy than a horror film no surprise why no one else has written comments on the imdb avoid it
i had just watched one episode of this program and i couldn't even get to the end of the program every minute i had watched this program my must of dropped about points this is basically like a program but with swearing not even the swearing and the insults she tells other people made me laugh anyways the story must of been written by a monkey and the people who actually put this script for this program through for filming must of been held at gun point and had no choice but to film this retarded disappointing horribly acted program sarah silvermann should use the little money she actually made from this program and get some god damn acting lessons
i sat through this turkey because i hadn't seen it before and because the premise sounded like it had potential it was mildly entertaining until the hurricane sequence at the height of the storm the wind is strong enough to blow windows out of the house yet the trees in the background are perfectly upright and not a leaf is moving in fact when the characters move outside the house bright sunlight is visible illuminating the treetops at that point whatever credence the filmmakers had developed evaporated faster than the highly localized rain in their film too bad all hurricanes aren't like this one it would surely help our homeowners insurance rates here in the sunshine state
my complaints here concern the pacing and the material at hand while using archival film and letters lends the film a fresh and interesting perspective too often the material selected to highlight simply isn't very interesting as when goebbels complains about this or that ailment or the ad nauseam footage of his small german hometown also the movie crawls along in covering c and then steams through the war years in sum the film is little better than a history channel documentary with the exception that the filmmaker has a slightly greater sensibility than your average history channel documentary editor and thus can more artfully arrange the details of goebbels life still i found it wanting
but i got over it to me it seemed that even the author of the book favored caroline i felt so sorry for the character louise and she was constantly compared with esau who was evil i just felt the comparison was a bit harsh and un-realistic really though the movie was bad i wouldn't really see it unless you're ready for a big let down
tv pilots don't you love them quinn martin tried this one out after being successful in a bunch of other tv detective movies but this one goes nowhere except in the realm of mst where it belongs roy thinnes is diamond head who takes orders from aunt mary to find super spy lovejoy i mean tree zulu and tso-tsing are there for ethnic comic relief and not much else tree sucks as a bad guy despite all his disguises that makes him look exactly the same as he normally does more unnatural clothing fiber here than you can ever imagine in the the show itself is so anti-climatic why did it not go to series you figure it out quite blatant again fun for mst but not a lot else
this is the worst movie i have ever seen the avengers held this dubious honor but no longer the acting in jill the ripper is terrible and was only eclipsed by the plot this movie is as intellectually stimulating as the telletubbes it doesn't know whether it wants to be an flick or a really bad thriller only watch under extreme intoxication or if you're bed ridden and need a leather clad distraction this script should be reworked into a porn it wouldn't take very much effort and would have a longer shelf life a porn even a bad porn wouldn't do the damage to dolf career the way that this movie has
sogo ishii can be a skilled filmmaker under the right conditions but gojoe tells the story of a warrior monk and his only rival a scion of the genji clan the film-making has the main hallmarks of a low-budget production including blurry fight scenes and clumsy montages kind you might find in an under-produced dorama the monk benkei informs his spiritual teacher that his destiny lies in defeating the mysterious spirit that guards gojoe bridge at night but he doesn't realize that this decision will bring him squarely into conflict with nearly every element of society at that time but which could earn him enlightenment no absence of ambitiousness however in its depiction of the conflict between the holy and the worldly artsy flourishes in some of the photography and editing help to compensate for the loose film-making style disappointment
this is probably the worst movie i have ever seen even worse than dungeons and dragons and any film starring kevin rock looked very uncomfortable throughout this whole film and his supporting actors didn't even look like they were trying to act chris rock is a wonderful stand-up comedian but he just can't transfer his talent to this film which probably only has two strained laughs in the whole you haven't watched this film yet avoid it like the plague go do something constructive and more interesting like watching the weather channel or watching paint dry on a brick chris efforts i give it a
this was recently on vibrant movie classics and i had to laugh i had high hopes for this adventure that follows in the vein of voyage to the core and mysterious island i was sorely disappointed not only in the acting credentials but in the silly story line that reads from a five year comic book be sure to catch sight of the wires that are holding on to the wings when they grasp ogar a half idiot pre-modern man who befriends the lost adventurers the ending left it open for further rehashing of the same effects in people that time forgot don't waste your time
my favorite part was when the credits started to roll i wish i could give it a out of i really wish i had that hour and thirty minutes back don't waste your money or time on it i really could have watched grass grow and felt better after was really pretty and i hope the movie didn't destroy her career but she chose to be in in all it sucked more than any other movie has sucked more than kazaam and glitter combined saying
story of a good-for-nothing poet and a sidekick singer who puts his words to music director danny boyle has lost none of his predilection for raking in the gutter of humanity for characters but he has lost in this film the edge for creating inspiring and funny films strumpet is painful to watch and barely justified by the fact that it was made for tv
imagine you're a high-school boy in the back of a dark uncrowded theater with your girlfriend how bad would a movie have to be in order that you would feel compelled to leave the theater and head home before it ended this movie is that bad really movies often become so bad that they're good this movie is beyond that stage of bad-ness it is painfully bad horribly terribly crime-against-humanity bad
this movie is not only boring it is also really badly done the graphics are so bad they are not even second rate they are dreadful the characters do not show any facial expresssions the voice acting is empty and without any soul and the plot absolutely lacks well anything and everything my year old likes it but thinks a bit boring i agree with him
this could have been a good episode but i simply had to turn it off the british representation was horrible to watch have the makers ever set foot in britain prior to filming at least set foot in england i don't think any british person have had such an accent apart from a comedy skit of the royal family also with the english boys well i don't think any english boy has acted spoke or dressed like any english kid in the history of the british nation since prince william and preteen public appearances to american film makers there is more than country in the uk england wales scotland and northern ireland meaning more than culture i can handle some stereotyping but this was so bad i could not watch it fire looked cool though
from the beginning of the movie i had a feeling like its a movie about another from friday the and it is dispute that the movie starts interesting but as the times goes by its just a pointless movie about muted supernatural silent serial killer i mean he goes under the bed without making any sound not seen by anyone he was supposed to be blind after failed execution but he walks and kills people like he used to i'm tired of it for me all over the same another words unreal too many mistakes and confusing scene with tide up woman looked impressive but just at first time for that and for intriguing intro stars
i really don't get all the adulation that this film has received mawkish unnecessarily manipulative and dodges many of the big issues ie affairs and his predilection for having sex with men in public places that i suppose in the context of a commercial hollywood film is just about tolerable but with all the praise for russell performance the man just seems to shuffle about clutching his briefcase and wearing a grungy hat and somehow that seems to qualify as fine acting anyone who has ever known a person with mental health problems will realise that performance is little short of caricature it is also rather offensive and dare i say just on the right side of being truly terrible
i watched this film few times and all i can say that this is low budget rubbish and that it does not have anything to do with a real history facts actors performances is very poor but it is result of limited acting possibilities anyone who watched this film now probably think of hitler as some crazy skinny lunatic who running with a gun like some chicago gangster i can only to say that there is much better films about hitler and germany in those years and that rise of evil is very much under average i can recommend german film downfall in which you can see brilliant performance of switzerland actor bruno ganz in a roll of adolf hitler
even for the cocaine laced this is a pathetic i don't understand why someone would want to waste celluloid time effort money and audience brain cells to make such drivel if your going to make a comedy make it funny if you want to film trash like this keep it to yourself if you're going to release it as a joke like this don't i mean it was a joke right someone please tell me this was a joke please
this is the kind of movie which shows the paucity of french cinema when it comes to making desire to sound american is so glaring that you will not be fooled a you have not seen a serial killer movie since peeping male cops one and a you will plot more complicated than berling is not lucky with the the astoundlingly dumb l'inconnu de strasbourg a couple of years scenes with his pregnant wife are supposed to be a counterpart for the otherwise noir atmosphere of the rest of the plot-are among the worst ever a steamy love scene between them and a gory autopsy to get a pg and thus to attract the huge adolescent violent and absurd by a silent epilogue who could make a nice commercial for the c√¥te really the silence of the lame
the whole biker movie genre has to be made up of the worst films ever made this one delivers a lot of fighting generous amounts of blood bikers fighting indians and a shanty town that gets blown up and torn down one shack at a time the acting is beyond terrible what ever happened to robert walker jr at one point he was in some major studio productions and then he just faded away this movie really blows but if you have not seen a biker movie in a long time it is a good one to watch at the end of the movie you should feel a bit trashy for having watched it
i really hate this retarded show it sucks big time and personally i think it is insulting to fairy kind you believe in fairies that is i mean the people who had come up with such crap ought to have their heads examine huh and also there is a lot of craziness evil school teacher which i think is getting really old and also stupidity parents and fairy godfather in this show two of the things that i dispised and loathe in the whole world i say that this show is so annoying and should not be seen by prying eyes at all would make'em bleed to death
the have over the produced a few decent bids to acquire the title worst movie of all time and this is probably their prime achievement in these stakes in fact this film can be regarded as belonging to the so bad good category right up there with the products of the likes of edward wood jr or doris wishman this explains the imdb voting pattern for this film with some people handing out top quinn made the odd dodgy film in his time but this performance as a randy ghost is so incredibly bad it has to be seen to be believed
surviving christmas ben affleck james gandolfini christina applegate catherine o hara josh zuckerman bill macy jennifer morrison udo kier d mike mitchell dumped by his girlfriend a hotshot yuppie doesn't want to be left alone on christmas so he decides to return to his boyhood home imposing on the dysfunctional family that now lives there and bribes them to pose as his family an obnoxious and one-dimensional performance by affleck who mainly acts with a flashy smile makes his character come off as a mentally unbalanced creep but gandolfini and o hara breathe some life into this mess even for farce its silliness is lumbering not much makes sense from scene to scene and its sentimental messages are as phony as grin min rated ¬Ω
this is by far the worst i've seen in my years if someone offers this to you for free tell them no this movie makes you a dumber person for knowing you watched it the plot isn't even the worst part of this the acting camera work lighting and sound there is absolutely nothing to like about this movie whoever paid to have this film made is broke now i hope the director never gets the greenlight for another movie in its defense this movie was made quickly to try to capitalize on the actual btk capture but i've seen movie of the weeks that looked like oscar winners compared to this
while william shater can always make me smile in anything he appears in i especially love him as denny crane in boston legal well this show is all about glitz and dancing girls and screaming and jumping up and has none of the intelligence of millionaire none of the flair of deal or no show is all about dancing and stupid things to fill in the watched it of course just to check it out i did watch it for over minutes then i had to turn it best part of it was william shatner dancing on the stage he is a hoot unfortunately this show will not make a given
the first look on the cover of this picture it looks like a good rock n roll movie but don't let the cover fool you or the fact that alice cooper and blondie is in it the storyline is just horrible and so is the acting plain and simple not a movie about a roadie its just a thin love story so awful that you see right through it the only good thing about this movie is the good songs and that is why i give out of if it wasn't for the music it would of been out of meat loaf is a horrible least he was in and the girl who plays the groupie isn't even good looking this movie was a huge disappointment for me because it makes a lot of good promises
knights was just a beginning of a series a pilot one might say the plot really shouldn't call it that there wasn't any plot wasn't logical at all and there were many mistakes like i'm summarizing the the beginning of the movie someone said that there was only a couple of those cyborgs bad guys but after the climax nea found out that there were many many more left of them and it was told that cyborgs were hard to kill but after a training nea could kill them with a single movie was just pure kicking i wasn't surprised at all when i found out that the leading star was a kick was one positive thing in the whole movie it really gave a great deal of laughter when watching it and talking about it with my friends i recommend watching it if you are in need of laughter
the only redeeming part of this movie was the price i paid at least all i lost was and the time elapsed sitting through this bomb the crew member who was in charge of continuity missed the boat when the female lead and the fbi guy went to the alleged killers location mr fbi handed the female a revolver when the alleged killer came out the door the revolver has magically transformed into an automatic one is left to ponder would an fbp agent hand a weapon to a civilian i think not ms xavier appears to be a very attractive female it is too bad the r rating did not allow much of her to be seen it would seem that a film editor cut what might have been the best parts of the film out
who could possibly sympathize with these two obnoxious protagonists intended to be a light frothy comedy about neighbor children who can't give up their childhood game of dare even as they age well into adulhood comes off more as an exercise in cruelty and petulant self-indulgence as children the pair are unbearably precocious as adults they're intolerably immature a bad combination
the danish movie slim slam slum surprised me to be the worst movie i have seen to this date i didn't think that it was possible to top my list of bad bad b-movies but this one deserves the gold not funny bad acting bad filmed and the storyline is bad the only positive thing i can say about this movie is it has three girls in it i truly believe this flick has the potential to knock of the other danish movie stjerner uden hjerner as the badest danish film ever made and truly something congratulations in advance
i almost drowned in cheese watching this movie in fact i could not even finish it i want my money back one more of feeble attempts to come up with a new idea good thing i keep a bowl of lemons in the fridge just in case they should of gave nic cage a hat and a bull-whip swashbucklin performance in raising arizona or leaving las vegas beats this lemon people who are completely and totally most of them are should love this movie if this film had been animated i would have taken it more seriously i would of rather paid to see a completely stupid movie that did not try to hide it in my opinion this was a incredibly stupid movie and it made a even more incredibly sad attempt to try and hide that the sheep seem to love it though
today i visited an athenean cinema with my two kids years old payed x euros us total not to mention gas popcorn soda was asked to return my special glasses after leaving the theater and was forced to watch what could have been a great movie masterpiece but only proved to be a sick cold war like propaganda movie like none i have seen during the last years and this is supposed to be a movie for children in name the average working greek makes no more than euros a month us my kids liked it but then again they are no more than babies greek mora morons like the one who wrote the script the others who made this disgrace animation is fantastic but who gives a
i am and i hated this film its the worst film on earth i totally wasted my time watching it and was disappointed with it cause on the cover and on the back the film it looks pretty good but i was wrong its bad but when i saw delta she was totally different and a bad actress and i really didn't know how old the girls was trying to be i was so confused the film was in some parts confusing and i didn't enjoy it at all but i watched all the film just to see if it was going to get better but it didn't it was and did i say i don't think many other people liked it as well as boring boring
really truly abysmally garishly awful but actor clayton moore movie lone ranger acquits himself competently as an actor the only rare treat for five minutes if you want to plumb the depths of grotesquely transparent special effects southern california as the moon and again and again and acting so woodenly inept that it may be a spoof except that clear that it humor here except dialogue may be worse than any of these other aspects and the costumes well enough said plot what plot bad guy head bad guy and his henchmen including his earthly agent called krog carefully or you'll suspect a spoof on the name of founder ray his unbelievably inept gunsels however have handguns that never need reloading as does commando cody so there are numerous firefight
the film did what it set out to do show how a young girl copes with poverty and grows into her maturity however for most of us this subject has been explored adequately and in most instances with more sophistication than done here the movie fixated on breasts which soon became boring and i lost interest if this was on tv i would've switched to the latest news on the starr report how boring i found this movie
in salem a devious lies about a involvement in witchcraft sends an entire community into an uproar costume drama starring claudette colbert and fred macmurray isn't stuffy though neither is it a vivid depiction of contagious hysteria worked on by three writers ferris durward grimstead and bradley king the story elements are rather interesting coming out of hollywood in though to anyone who has since read arthur the crucible the hoked-up melodrama on display here won't be tolerated for very long biggest problem with the picture may lie in the casting colbert and macmurray are an ill-matched pair of lovers hindered by the witch-hunt macmurray being far too contemporary a presence for these surroundings from
the only scenes wich made me laugh where the ones with christopher walken in crazy rest of the movie was just the first hour or so nothing really which supposed to be funny aren't and zeta jones douglas is really roberts does a routine job of the former ugly duck right into the girl next door did i see this before who gets the really didn't care what would happen with the main cusack really fell of the building in a suicide attempt the movie could have been more interresting to watch
i mean seriously what group would sing about a crazy car so what if their ten way too immature for a little kid to sing about being my women i mean seriously the name is pretty corny too naked brothers just because they take off their pants how don't get why they need a tv show i mean most artist don't really need a tv show about themselves especially the naked brothers band heck how many of them are in the freaking group and seriously whats with the movie jeez nick use to be the hightlight of my years growing up but seriously the naked brother band so many parents would not let their kids watch this especially with the name the naked band its a stupid uncreative show that should not be aired onto tv
this has to be the most brutally unfunny comedy i've ever seen in my life ben stiller jack black and christopher walken as a crazed homeless man can't make me laugh got to be wrong with this picture this is the only movie i've ever felt like walking out of i used free passes and still felt like i wanted my money back i can wholeheartedly say that the only movie i've ever seen worse than this one was house of the dead the only worse movie i laughed very slightly at the merry-go-round scene and it spending hours in something billed as a comedy should get you more than one laugh right i don't know i guess the filmmakers thought that flan was a funny word or something and the other running joke really is beating a dead
and that comes from someone that will withstand almost any viewing the acting and sound is awful this might qualify for a so bad good point of some however i take my horror movies seriously and this is just just soooo cheap i think my major complaint the dialogue is often hilarious-attention to how many times you startled me is used the child actress is seriously god awful-i pray her acting career ended line donuts i hate donuts is worth repeated viewing however
add to the list of caricatures a southern preacher and congregation a torch singer tucker a dancing chorus and the mills brothers it only makes it burlesques of negro performers who themselves often appear in films to be parodying themselves and their race though the negro comedy may have been accepted in its day extremely offensive today and i doubt that it was ever funny though i wouldn't have been offended i don't think that i'd have laughed at the feeble attempts at humor as an white boy however i might not have understood some of it
for the life of me i can't understand the good reviews on this piece of crap it was pointless matthew modine was horribly miscast as a leading ladies man gina gershon well others have said it but i'll reiterate why the stupid accent totally unnecessary and her acting was just bad i don't know if she was thrown by the accent or what there was no chemistry between these two the girl modine was in love with suddenly shoving half a head of lettuce in her mouth and acting in a goofy way where did that come from i think we were supposed to feel sorry for her as we saw her marriage to a workaholic begin to crumble but frankly i couldn't care less about any of these people
this entry is certainly interesting for series fans myself but yet it is mostly incomprehensible the plot is confusing as is the sequel continuity some striking effects to be sure but we never find out what it all really to see the workprint version which contains the gore that was cut to be re-rated r
the first part of grease with john travolta and olivia newton john is one of the best movie for teens this one is a very bad copy the change is only in the sex in the first one the good one was sandy here michael i prefer to watch the first grease
of course i was watching bg i loved i liked season season was ok and loved the final one yay there is a spin-off show i didn't know about this at all one of my friends told me about this i was really watched the first episodes what a piece of rubbish teenage girl drama fest there is no science fiction well hardly any at the end of every episode we can catch a glimpse of a cylon all who cares this did they decide that the next target audience will be females under boring religious nonsense talking moaning bitching and some is just sad that there is nothing out there at the moment to watch stargate ruined bg over
can anybody do good cgi films besides pixar i mean really animation looked antiquated by standards and even by toy story standards or maybe they spent all their budget on hugh jackman whatever their reasoning the story truly did hugh jackman is a rat a rat that is flushed down a toilet yeah i know seems stereotypical but then the sewer mimicked the ways of london to an extent throw in a promise of jewels and an frog and you get a pathetic attempt at would like to say something entertained me maybe the hookup in the movie or maybe the happily-ever-after rat relationship but nothing did it had the talent but it blew up
taped this late night movie when i was in grade watched it on fast forward i sugest you do the same i though it would be and action film but went to a cort tv type movie in the end it fits in with the early social activest type films glad i missed that era
this movie is so bad comical in fact mystery science theatre the television show in which three characters watch and parody bad movies used this very film to mock i suggest watching it on youtube instead of actually seeing this do not see hobgoblins if you're not prepared to stop within the first scene actually do not see this movie period please at least not seriously its jokes are not funny say the least and you'll have much more fun parodying or watching a parody of it then viewing the may feel yourself becoming sick upon watching so spare yourself read a book do the laundry anything is more fun than watching hobgoblins
normally i'm not motivated to write reviews but this movie was so excruciatingly painful i feel i must i cringed at the appallingly predictable plot the lame acting and laughed at moments which were supposed to be tense indeed most of the audience seemed pretty bored and chatty even at the most tense moment of the movie molly ringwald stood out as the only performance of any merit in a tortured production even the twist at the end wasn't i've heard it said that the movie didn't take itself seriously but i could find little evidence of that in the should have been left on the cutting room floor do yourself a favour and spend your time and money on something else
this is one of the most god-awful movies ever shaq better just stick to basketball this movie took away apart of my life i will never have back i will make fun of this movie until i die and then some it is so horrible it is not even funny would have a blast with this one
i picked up this movie with the intention of getting a bad zombie movie but i had no idea what i was getting myself started the movie and soon i had been pulled into a world of pain and visual finally know what hell is like this movie for eternity this movie has no value it didn't even really have a plot there was stuff going on in each scene but no overall explanation why anything of watching this movie i suggest that you line the nearest blender with oil and try and stuff as many bullets in it as you can you will find that the outcome to be far more pleasant than this even watch it not even to see how bad it is i beg you if you watch it then it means they win
meaning if this movie got pitched scripted made released promoted as something halfway respectable given the constraints i know springer sex violence where is me of porn movies i saw in college plot and dialogue wise shoulda just done something for the scurrilous porno market showed penetration and be done with would have made more money the ultimate point of this exercise
underneath the dense green glop of computer graphics there gleamed the astounding art and skill of ichikawa somegoro alas it got lost in all the goo the scenes of old edo with the courtesan drifting on the sumida rehearsing and acting in the nakamura-za were all exciting and engaging taking you back to an interesting and rich era the action on the kabuki stage in which somegoro excels and excites was more enriching than any of the absurd high jinks that followed the skill the energy in the audience the colors of the sets were far more satisfying than all the nonsense that took over plot and performance what a wasted opportunity one of the best kabuki actors alive and he gets lost in the dreck
i can't believe this is on dvd even less it was available at my local video argue this is a good movie if you take in consideration it had only a budget i find this funny i would find it very bad whichever the more funny i read the following in another review dramatics aside if you love horror and you love something along the lines of duel updated with a little more story and some pretty girls thrown in you'll love this this is a shame comparing those two give a since i can't give a i just don't see any way this movie could be entertaining
i wonder who was responsible for this mess the jokes wouldn't have worked for island if this had gone to series would there have been jokes about auschwitz or would eva have to replace her oven only to have adolf suggest the kind that seats another post compared this show to i love lucy the problem with this is that lucille ball was a genius at physical comedy and bizarre situations and this mess was just plain badly done and an insult to my intelligence the damage the did to england and the number of people they killed i would think the very concept of a comedy about hitler would seem repugnant and most normal people would have killed this concept before any episodes were produced
this was a complete disappointment the acting isn't bad but the production was just so bad that at times i felt i needed to stop it but i sadly made it through and was able to finish it a bit embarrassed by the whole poor movie it is if you are with cheesy moral plots and don't mind watching a movie that vastly misconstrues whitman if you want a cheesy fictional story go for it
i'm among millions who consider themselves cary grant fans but i can't think of a single reason to recommend this don't understand the casting of betsy drake and it appears no one else we're to judge from the small number of films in which she played fans will agree that katharine hepburn was superb at chasing and catching cary grant in bringing up the director or writers try to rehash the it fails read comments about how creepy drake i thought that was far too mild a description franchot tone walked through this one as if he were casting disaster is one film is a total one doesn't deserve lines of comments and i don't know why a bad this one was preserved when so many worthwhile films lie rotting in you want to torture this one a wide berth
a real challenge to make a movie about a baby being devoured by wild canines and the mother being wrongly accused of murder funny but against all odds this one succeeds meryl streep gives the performance of her life melodramatic overwrought but with that comic genius that keeps you laughing even as a mother struggles with the ultimate comedies about the infants being eaten by dogs are not your cup of tea you might be uncomfortable watching this and yes it is an odd choice of topic for a farce but really very little of the movie has anything to do with that as it focuses on giving streep a showcase for her aussie accent and facial contortions in a slam at media bias and sensationalism and disregard for either the truth or ethics gives the movie the chance to make the daring point that those things are bad
it was obvious that this movie is designed to appeal to the chick flick audience to which i have sat through quite a few and enjoyed most however this was a very irritating attempt by heather graham to become the next meg ryan who became annoying as hell in her own right her acting was overdone and it appeared that she was overanxious compared to her colleagues who were relaxed in their roles this film might have been more as there was suitable budget for settings actors and a decent story line my wife and i both agreed that this was muck at the end as the film ended on a painful embarrassing high better luck next time hope miss graham sticks to the type of films that she belongs in like from hell
i am definitely a burt reynolds fan but sorry this one really stinks most of the dialogue is laughable and the only interesting plot twist is in the last five minutes of the movie i can't believe he even made this one is he actually that hard up for money
this is the worst show i have seen in years i believe that it should be taken off of because of its retardedness it is so dumb i could faint when i watch it though i never watch it because it is sooooo poor when mac says he eat sugar in another episode he eats sugar almost everything in the world has sugar in it in episode eddie monster when eddy screams at terrance he falls into the crate twice plus the seconed time he falls in he doesn't fall in he falls off to the side what stupidity i can't even say the word fosters home i even made a song with my band about how retarded this show is byyyyyyyyeeeee
generally i don't like films directed by sydney pollack firm being somewhat of an exception and i've never been a robert redford fan either still i thought three days of the condor must be good because of the number of praising comments it has the widescreen cinematography is quite pleasing for the eye and max von sydow does a nice job as the sinister professional killer i found the whole affair tremendously disappointing the film undeniably radiates paranoid atmosphere but everything is ruined by the muddled plot which doesn't seem to make any film also contains one of the most unsatisfying endings i have ever seen which really leaves the viewer hanging in the air and what can one say about that absurd romance between redford and dunaway i'd much rather watch any of films five times in succession than to sit through this piece of waste once more
can we say retarded this girl has no talent what so ever nothing but complete garbage you people are just marking stars because you know most people hate this pathetic woman if its such a great show then why did it get canceled after measly episodes exactly people that support her please seek help you do not know what is funny her stand up comedy is just so stupid seriously how do you find this trash funny the show tries to poke fun at stereo types and other things that are not funny at all carlos mencia is funny and to that stupid poster he actually has fans and his show is on the air so i'm sorry your a redneck who doesen't get his jokes please give me my minutes of my life back
i go to the cinema to be entertained there is absolutely nothing entertaining about this film from beginning to end there is no respite from the gray grinding reality of this life it is one-paced with no change of mood i remained until the end only because i was convinced that things must get better they don't and i don't think i was the only one as evidenced by the many groans ringing around the cinema as the film drew mercifully to a close honestly depicting social depravation is no crime but boring your audience to groans is not the way to win the sympathy of the public a dreadful film
one of the silliest movies of the an unbearable haunted house comedy with music starring kay kyser kyer orchestra leader and radio-star eternal college fraternity goof-off was sort of the precursor to spike jones hamming it up for his guests and backed up willingly by his merry troupe of musicians hired to play a birthday party in a gloomy mansion the kind where poison darts imported from africa are framed and hung on the wall the shindig is beset with a creepy judge a scary professor an ominous swami lots of giggly females and enough bad jokes to fill three bob hope pictures the songs jimmy mchugh and johnny mercer are nothing to brag out and neither is over-confident kyser yukking it up with elbow-in-the-ribs material that turns back ten years from
this movie is a bad memory from my childhood this is one of those movies that they show kids on a rainy day at school when you can't go out for recess and you'd rather be watching anything anything else at least what it was like when i was in elementary school i just remember hating this movie granted i haven't seen it in years or so and they probably don't use it on rainy days anymore but i just want to warn everyone you'd be better off using this to put your kids to sleep than entertaining them trust me pick anything else even though the topic is kind of controversial the plot is so tame and slow that i can't remember anything about it except that i disliked it so strongly that here years later i felt the need to warn all of you against it
i can't believe this movie was made as recently as got some laughable acting not to mention one of the stupidest plots ever who would ever ask fat texas sheriff joe don baker to escort an italian he illegally arrested in mexico back to italy not to mention that the title of the movie tells you pretty much nothing about it in fact about as generic a title for a wannabe film as i can think glad i only saw this on with mike and the bots as a shield they remark on the female resemblance to elaine from seinfeld of them are spongeworthy and riff non-stop on weight this movie probably isn't worse than mitchell but reputation definitely precedes him here when his title comes up at the beginning of the film tom says i wish i was illiterate so i wouldn't have to read that
this is a great story and was just the beginning of equality in the united states are still working on it too however despite the fact this is true still a movie and this is a movie site i realize independent films have a hard time getting good actors but wow the only one even mediocre is the excellent ossie davis but even he couldn't make up for all the actors the one playing him as a young man absolutely atrocious acting granted the script was terribly clich√© but even then you have got to get some decent actors i wouldn't recommend this to anybody because it is so poorly done in every category read some books about the true story of the mason because they give these men the respect they deserve
don't waste your time or money on this one the half decent cast might fool you into thinking that this teen-thriller whilst hardly about to break any records might lightly entertain for won't make you scared laugh cry or even challenge your intellect it will leave you wondering how on earth this movie ever finished production yes it really is that poor
included some would film is not possible to take seriously at some parts it is so awfully stupid that i just can't help laughing at it all try me for the sequence where character jumps some meters with full climbing gear or this is really my favorite snuffs a bad guy by sticking him onto a stalactite yeah what ungodly strength did he muster to accomplish such feats i dunno but he sure gives reality a run for the money
contrast to other comments previously written i have to say that the only good thing about this film is the fact that one guy in it looked a bit like jason donavon which reminded me of my youth i have no idea how it won any awards and although i'm sure a great deal of effort went into making it it was all fruitless as the final outcome is one which screams of early foreign soap operas the plot was non-existent the cinematography was hopeless and the acting was on par with an a-level performance it was unfortunately long and the sub-plots were incredibly your best friend slept with your ex-boyfriend of years after only weeks of being broken up you would not all remain the best of friends it was all fantasy all oh yeah and the weird core indie was mind numbing
frank the home front is one of the more lifeless private snafu shorts a series of cartoons made as instructional films for the military rather than have snafu take some inadvisable actions leading to disaster the home front instead focuses on his loved ones back home and how much they have to offer to the war effort too snafu realises he was wrong when he thought they had it easy a concept with few possibilities for good gags and instead tashlin plays the risqu√© card more heavily extended jokes involving strippers and scantily clad dancing girls in place of much effective comic relief the result is a well-meaning short which has little relevance or entertainment value today other than as an historical artefact
not a film but film for the gang one of the worst films ever made by a male director about woman director andy mckay simply doesn't know woman peaks of bad taste american humor style crude story no sense groundless story refuted characters vulgar fantasies came to life on screen insulting and definitely not funny i wonder how three good actresses accepted to take part in it
a cannibalistic backwoods killer is on the prowl and two bickering couples might be his next source of protein in this bargain basement friday the cheapie there s literally nothing of interest to see in this one the killings are surprisingly sparse and when they do happen completely amateurish it also adds ghosts into the mix for no reason what so ever i felt drained after watching it as if my brain was liquefying and draining out my nose and it remains without a doubt donald jones worst movie if you're thinking of renting it because of code snazzy new dvd re-release don't grade f
the prerequisite for making such a film is a complete ignorance of work and personality psychoanalytical techniques and history take a well-know genius you have not read describe him as demented include crazy physicians to cure him a couple of somewhat good looking women have his role played by an actor with an enormous mustache have every character speak with the strongest accent show ridiculous dreams include another prestigious figure who has nothing to do with the first one mention a few words used in the genius works overdo everything you can particularly music and you are done audience please stay away
weak plot predictable violence only semi interesting characters like the writer one of the stars was fictionalizing his own screw ups and added an incredulous fantasies of drugs and murder to make it hot from the predictable rap and house soundtrack to the family conflicts poorly acted stereotypical and ultimately terribly boring even the title has been done before imdb lists five movies with the same name released in saw it on showtime which listed the synopsis for one of the other movies was halfway thru before i realized no one was an undercover cop even tho another stereotype would have made it interesting if it happened
i have never seen the older highly rated version i am a nicholas cage fan the way fine acting as usual this movie probably took all of five minutes to hammer out the whole plot can see it being done on a cocktail napkin at a dinner party if you can't figure out the ending of this drool in the first thirty minutes you will probably find this movie entertaining this is of late the terrible rut that hollywood seems to have dug for itself with the genre unable to give the audience enough credit and write a fresh smart and tantalizing screenplay they dish out some creepy music and throw in a couple of things to make you jump a little and then send the final print off to your local theater at least it didn't have the jiggling hand-held camera syndrome
when i go to see a movie about i'm not expecting oscar calibre performances or writing on the level of the godfather but i do expect the actors to at least not look like their straining to read their cue cards and dialogue that doesn't sound like it was typed out minutes before the actor reads it into the camera this movie was just awful i actually got up and left about minutes in and went next door and watched cold creek manor that wasn't very good either but it seemed like citizen kane compared to this pile of crap on the plus side the girls were very pretty probably the only thing that kept me in my seat for longer than the first minutes in fact i left after the hottest one got killed there wasn't anything to hold my interest after that
as someone who lived still remembers that decade the actual had been half this funny and would have been so much more kids in that era did not act or behave anything close to as bright-eyed and normal as these kids youth was still under the influence of the hippies and the drug culture all that rebellion that it in the behavior unreasonableness of them none of the characters exhibit any of compared to happy i can see were both sitcoms that take place years before the current time they were they both offer only surface cliched depictions of the actual even close to the full scope of showing the obvious things the those too young to weren't born weren't like more than happy days were like the actual didn't accurately portray life at a us army medical base during the korean
the opening minutes gave me hope then meyers proved he only had one good idea for the rest of the movie absolute lowest common denominator humor painful viewing a complete chore written no doubt in less than a week just like the first one give meyers the hook and lock him in a cell with adam sandler and will farrell and don't let him out until developed a decent script for something anything he has it in him these austin powers things are just embarrassing goldmember sink without trace
then you'd better not watch this movie they've completely ruined the premise of the show in the movie the duke boys are idiots daisy is trampy roscoe is sinister boss hogg is capable uncle jessie is a cooter and flash are true to the original characters at least enos is kinda one point they open the doors to get into the general lee nuff original show may not have been great tv but it was entertaining and the characters made sense this movie is like dumb dumber meets the simple life
my first exposure to the templarios not a good one i was excited to find this title among the offerings from anchor bay video which has brought us other cult classics such as spider baby the print quality is excellent but this alone can't hide the fact that the film is deadly dull a thrilling opening sequence in which the villagers exact a terrible revenge on the templars set the whole thing in motion but everything else in the movie is slow ponderous ultimately unfulfilling adding insult to injury the movie was dubbed not subtitled as promised on the video jacket
serious home kid knock off with enough bad character stereotypes to have the writer sued and then shot you could see blatant stunt man usage in almost every scene oh and the acting sucks too although i must say that the line sorry dude i have to take a major dump big time made me laugh my ass off
i'm getting a little tired of people misusing name to perpetuate their own bigoted view on the world well i don't dismiss the idea of armageddon or the coming of the anti-christ i do dismiss the idea that only certain people who live truly good seem to be mostly white christian children will go to heaven while the rest of us must suffer through a millenia of hell on earth just because we weren't good enough god may be a judge but i don't think he is going to measure every level of goodness give the creator some credit
this is almost the worst film you will ever see doomsday currently pulls the rug from under this one for me the props are a perfect example of what frank zappa once referred to as cheepnis it looks as if the space scenes were made in a power station just prior to demolition the music really sucks the acting is wooden and ham the characters they portray are shallow and unconvincing the plot is predictable it is immediately and brazenly obvious when they copy techniques and ideas from other films the quality of direction beggars you have to see it if only to experience what has to be one of the biggest wastes of a tiny budget ever this is a priceless example of a stupid movie
i would put this at the top of my list of films in the category of unwatchable trash there are films that are bad but the worst kind are the ones that are unwatchable but you are suppose to like them because they are supposed to be good for you the sex sequences so shocking in its day couldn't even arouse a rabbit the so called controversial politics is strictly high school sophomore amateur night marxism the film is self-consciously arty in the worst sense of the term the photography is in a harsh grainy black and white some scenes are out of focus or taken from the wrong angle even the sound is bad and some people call this
this movie was awful in the worst way you just didn't care you didn't care what happened in the plot you didn't care about the characters everyone was devoid of heart i ended up walking out about an minutes into it because i simply didn't want to subject my mind to it any more there is far too much sex in the film sex can be okay it can even make the movie karma sutra but the intercourse here was not beautiful or sexy it was just ugly don't see this film
in over years of watching has to be one of the very worst comedies ever made mel brooks mike meyers a few other have made some very bad comedies this however is the absolute bottom of the is unfunny from the very the tacked on scene during the keaton who i normally like must have needed her paycheck badly she desperately needs to re-learn her shepard do not know who he a better show him how to tyler is also not up to her white needs to find another has done this same type person a few times too howard who started out years back as a first rate actor also not as good as he used to is nothing decent i can say on this attempt at movie of points of imdb of
pointless boring film with charismatic mercurio completely wasted released for a minute on a thursday in maybe one local cinema and avoided by the entire population of sydney except me and four others back of beyond is a project seemingly created by a producer looking for a fee local actors like john polson and terry serio deserve better polson has morphed into a director of lame thrillers like swimfan and hide and seek and terry serio seems never to get a guernsey apart from thug roles but paul mercurio should have become one of greatest exports on screen roles like this are major disappointments and films like this are just a waste of talent and time
based upon the recommendation of a friend my wife and i invited another couple to this film i really apologized to of us hated it and spent the whole time looking at our watches waiting for the film to finally end half the vignettes are bizarre with very little entertainment value there were few scenes of example i was looking forward to seeing some pictures of the latin quarter but i couldn't really recognize anything most of the scene was inside a bar no one in the theater laughed at anything or reacted in any way if you like bizarre pretentious pseudo-intellectual films don't miss this if you are down to earth like me you will be sorry you saw it
as far as the movie goes an ok science fiction movie it has a lot of cool stuff in it and some quality scenes that said not that good and some of the stuff is pretty far for calling this another cube-movie is utter and complete this is the very definition of milking a great and inventive original movie the whole feel to it can be somewhat translated into the core of the first but the introduction of as part of the team behind the cube itself is somewhat a gave this a because of the backstabbing of the original this one should have been kept sterile in so many parts of the movie that there is no place or time to mention them for those who have not seen cube hypercube but not recommendable for fans of the series
spinal tap was funny because if you knew a little about heavy metal you saw in-jokes all over the place if you know anything about porn this mock documentary will leave you cold everything in it rings tap was funny because it took a familiar world and pushed it over the top this film is decidedly not funny because it paints a picture of how porn is made that bears no relationship to the real acting here is uniformly awful but that would not matter much if the core idea of the movie were good but not
and this movie has crossed it i have never seen such a terrible movie in my life i mean a head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled a snowman with a costume that has the seams clearly visible this was a pitiful excuse for a movie
i must be that one guy in america that didn't like this movie i guess this just wasn't my style or something i just don't see so fascinating about it this was entertaining let alone one of the greatest achievements in cinema history about a guy that came from nothing and goes on to become a drug lord pretty simple way to describe an entire movie and exactly my feeling about the entire movie contrary to what a lot of people think just because a movie is about groups doesn't automatically make it a great movie don't forget good storytelling
this movie was definitely the worst movie i've seen in my entire life and i've seen some pretty bad movies i didn't like the way this movie was filmed all of the actors are unknown and it looks as though a bunch of friends got together and decided to film their own movie but absolutely horrible i've never seen a worse movie the story is so fake and i just found that it took a really long time to get to the end of the movie there was no plot it looked as though it wasn't planned out before they started filming the story is too weird i didn't like how slow it took to get to the point of the movie there was no point in even filming this movie if you're considering watching this movie don't you're just wasting your time
i awake suddenly aware that i'm drooling onto the plastic couch cover and realize a warm saturday afternoon why was i sleeping did i hit my head or accidentally swallow all of my muscle relaxers could it be adult onset narcolepsy i momentarily paused on cheap seats while channel surfing and the stunning lack of humor and talent drained my life force with such speed that i blacked that head-shaking mouth-agape shoulder-shrugging bad but i have to give these moronic and boring twins credit for selling this idea through perhaps they had the same effect on the espn programming executive that they had on me and when woke up a few horrendous episodes were already in the can and hoped that since all the viewers will be asleep no one will now how awful it is and can keep the annual been warned
just a dumb old movie first son gets his foot trapped in a really dumb way and then her husband gets his foot trapped in another really dumb way in an effort to save him stanwyck gets unlucky yet again and comes across an escaped convict she has a chance to kill him but fails in a very dumb way in the end her husband is saved and stanwyck tells us through narration what the dumb message of the movie is well than ends could never figure out how an unattractive woman like stanwyck ever made it as a leading lady in glamour-oriented golden era that nose is so beautiful so photogenic the film is mercifully short running a little over an hour as though the director sensed that he was making crap so he thought it best to keep the crap short
in the words of charles character in this film bollocks no plot no character development and utterly of stuff that just doesn't happen in the real world when were british police inspectors armed with handguns in shoulder holsters full of mistakes trains in london full of dull and artificial dialogue and the is awful wobbly hand-held camera shots that add nothing to the film except a vague feeling of seasickness confusing jump-cuts no snipes character is totally unsympathetic why should we care what happens to him direct to video direct to the dustbin
most of the french films i've seen and enjoyed were more talk than action but okay i found them interesting well-photographed and with intriguing actors i did at one point wonder if gerald depardieu was in every french film ever made it seemed that movie has the same interesting visuals and had a good opening but then it became talk talk and more is fine for a drama but not for a murder mystery after awhile i almost fell asleep watching the film was more like a play with almost all the scenes played out in one room thus if you love plays you should like i want a little more bang for a murder story
how could out of prior voters give this movie a how could more than half the prior voters give it a or higher who is voting here i can only assume it is primarily kids very young kids the fact is that this is a bad movie in every way the story is stupid the acting is hard to even think of as acting the characters are characterless and the dialogue is terrible i saw this one rainy afternoon on the sci-fi channel in the sad event that it is ever rebroadcast i suggest you read a book instead
entertainment tonight has been going down hill for the last few years but as of last night they reached a new an effort to try to hype up their broadcast they decided to post actual photos of jonbenet body in their teasers last night saying pictures from the case you have never seen before the two photos were graphic and very disturbing one was of the side of her face and and you could clearly see the cord that was used to strangle her around her neck and bruising on her face this was so hideously awful i could not believe it how has this got to do with anything remotely related to hollywood entertainment nothing they have dropped their level of dignity and values to a new it shows this used to be the premiere show to just garbage will watch access hollywood from now on
utterly predictable silly show about a man who has killed his wife by mowing her down when driving and claimed he had blacked out why was he still driving a car why did he still feel able to drive a car having killed his wife with one this question has not occurred to the writers the story then witters on about a psychologist and her failing marriage which is tied into the failing marriage of wife-killing blackout driver an omniscient mother and one dimensional child are thrown in for good measure and the whole builds up to a predictable denouement and crashing finale are police psychologists so easily taken in deadful writing that the actors do their best with but they are doomed to failure this is on a par with a harlequin romance don't waste your time watching this one unless what you are aiming for
okay the story makes no sense the characters lack any dimensionally the best dialogue is ad-libs about the low quality of movie the cinematography is dismal and only editing saves a bit of the muddle but sam peckinpah directed the film somehow his direction is not enough for those who appreciate peckinpah and his great work this movie is a disappointment even a great cast cannot redeem the time the viewer wastes with this minimal proper response to the movie is the contempt that the director san peckinpah james caan robert duvall burt young bo hopkins arthur hill and even gig young bring to their work watch the great peckinpah films skip this mess
truly a disgusting vile film with only a small amount of real character of the father in particular is vulgar in the extreme so obviously and portrayed in the most pathetic seedy wife and i found this film horribly upsetting with absolutely no redeeming features at all frankly i wish i had never seen consider this british effort to be a sick and gross who enjoyed this film have an ability i totally lack that of rejoicing in a display of deep depravity and producers should be ashamed of themselves
as a jane eyre fan i was excited when this movie came out at last i thought someone will make this book into a movie following the story actually written by the author wrong if the casting director was intending to cast a jane who was plain he certainly succeeded however surely he could have found one who could also act where was the tension between jane and rochester where was the spooky suspense of the novel when the laughter floated into the night seemingly from nowhere where was the sparkle of the child who flirted and danced like her mother finally why was the plot changed at the end one wonders whether the screenwriters had actually read the book what a disappointment
the first mistake you make in titling a film is to use of the living dead without really having a budget for real zombie fx sure this was a low budget zombie flick really low budget i thought it was a film school project amateur actors and amateur was really not too bad considering the above and it presented an interesting twist to the zombie genre if you are going to get an r for violence you might as well give us some good shots of the babes being attacked the women were so little used in this film that it could almost be classified as gay i am staying out of oakland there was a heck of a lot of shooting going on and no cops in sight
i can enjoy a guilty pleasure vigilante flick but this is just bad and not bad in a way you might enjoy seeing make fun of it just nauseatingly bad like you can't find anything to enjoy about this no matter how hard you try i truly regret wasting hours of precious life on this crap you can tell by watching it that no one was asked to act and everyone in it knew this film would only bury their careers apparently walking tall has garnered enough income that someone decided they could make a buck off their investment if not the worst film i've seen so bad that blotted the worse films from my memory
this is not a movie is like a bad acid trip for kids under the age of for a month my year old from time-to-time would ask me why was that rabbit bleeding from its mouth or why did the bulldozer bury all the rabbits that wasn't the worst of it we stopped it about a hour in but the damage had been done intensely morbid oppressive violent fortunately finally forgotten about the whole wretched thing whomever decided this movie should be marketed to children should be brought up on charges ahead censure me my conscience is clear
this is the third parody of the scary movies and hopefully the last this time the spoof is mainly on the ring signs and mile for some weird reason in my opinion this movie was very pointless and unnecessary and not even funny i laughed maybe three times and that is not enough for a comedy i really enjoyed the first two but this one was just plain dumb if your jokes consist of corpses getting beat up and people constantly throwing stuff at each other then this movie is for you in my opinion if your smart enough stay at home and save your money and please stop making these kind of movies they just keep getting worse
whattt was with the sound it sounded like it was all bad plot bad accents bad dougray and we live in scotland acting bad harp bad sex scenes we watched it until the end in disbelief how could such a good roll call of actors perform so badly will they ever get a decent job again bad bad by the way we gave it because we at least were enticed to watch it to the end due to its bizarre plot to the older reviewer i totally agree it was like a romantic farce from the how did it get made in ok there were some ok bits they had a nice house in bristol dougray had a nice boat jennifer looked nice in a little outfit but how come the sister got all the men
no need to detail what others have written in other reviews here goes the summary much of the nested animation work is downright gorgeous the colors are superb would love to have it done in silk as a the story and execution is a total snooze it was quite difficult to stay awake at you are a student of the fine arts medieval calligraphy early religion and so forth have at it this is a film for you want an engaging entertaining movie look elsewhere this is a failure as anything other than an artistic didn't have horns by the way
in the lost son a private eye searching for a missing man stumbles upon a child prostitution ring this film incorporates all of the worst stereotypes you could imagine in a worst-case scenario that exists only in the minds of hollywood the press and ag john asscrap if you get a chance to see this you'd be better off getting lost yourself
but the actress playing the daughter just doesn't come across as doesn't work for me when i see an actress of about years playing the role of a other commentators have suggested that this is one of the messages of this film that children may sometimes seem more adult-like than adults but with the casting as it is in this film it just doesn't work for might want to check other comments to find out what this film is actually about because i couldn't bear watching it to the agree that the premise for this film is beautiful though i wish another director would try to pick up this story again
i will probably always go to see a woody alleb movie as one never knows when he just might make a real return to his past greatness just one or two great moments or lines could make it worthwhile sadly however this film just does'nt make it on any score saying thar actually makes me sad and even a little guilty i'm sure my reaction is much like a lot of other fans of woody but what can one say probably time for him to concentrate on his clarinett which in my opinion he is rather quite good saying all of this i'll still probably go to any new film woody may come out with in the future always hope and i'll continue to love and respect the woody
i don't think this movie was rated correctly i took my copy and blacked out the pg rating and wrote down r i would not recommend this for anyone under or whatever the r limit it contains a scene in the jungle with several topless indian women i don't know about you but not something for little children to be watching true it might be the traditional clothing style of the african indians but i think partial nudity should give a movie an r haven't seen the movie recently but i guess otherwise it was alright
there are a number of problems with this movie but the bottom line is that it tried to do too much with too little the base story is quite good but the money just wasn't there to do the story justice the non-existent budget really killed this movie stuart gordon has writing credit on honey i shrunk the kids which was a box office smash however that movie had some serious cash backing from disney honestly this is a good example of when to not make a movie had he waited a few more years technology would have made it cheaper to do many of the effects to mention he could have found a company with money
poor tobe hopper he directed an all time horror classic texas chaimsaw massacre since then everything done has been horrible this is probably the saying a lot about a man dourif who has the ability to make things people catch something like that hardly an original idea remember firestarter a real everything is done wrong pathetic acting dourif asinine script loust production values crappy special is bad a must even good for laughs
the first five minutes of this movie showed potential after that it went straight from something possibly decent to some sort of illegitimate comedy the best part is that i couldn't stop thinking of supertroopers thanks to joey kern i would recommend watching this movie for the sheer fact of learning how not to make a movie there are so many scenes in this movie that makes one just stop and wonder if the entire cast and crew just stopped caring at some point the thing that amazes me most about this movie is that it grossed million in the box office and only cost about million to make congrats to gate for being able to pull that one off
i can't say i liked this movie very has some amusing it doesn't seem able to make up its mind whether it is a comedy or a doesn't really work as too light in tone to be a the amusing moments are few and far also doesn't make a lot of seem to happen for no also extremely feel like they just made things up as they were they had just taken a bit of time to explain might have been a better would say the ending was anti climatic but that would mean the rest of the movie had actually been building up to it just sorts didn't find it like i there just isn't any give winter kills a reluctant and weak
spoken like a true hard-boiled u'an gangsta the story is no worse than any number of gangster flicks but never ever confuse this movie with the godfather i or ii or goodfellas it is not in the same what makes the film periodically painful to watch is all these italian americans swaggering around dropping bad gangsta lines in an even worse fake u'an accent pacino would have been great if they could just have dubbed him i was looking forward to see abrahams and loggia but their steenky accents spoiled the well the script ain't too hot either don corleone would have made this disappear five minutes after meeting him smiling and patting him on the back all the while
you know what kind of movie you're getting into when the serial killer main character is being transported to the electric chair what seems to be a bakery truck only to have the prison vehicle collide with i'm not making this up a genetic engineering tanker truck the goo which spurts forth melts him and fuses his dna with the snow creating our protagonist the killer favorite portion of the movie however is an over-the-shoulder shot of the snowman thrashing some poor schmuck in which his hands look suspiciously like a couple of white oven-potholder schlock
first of the hell why in the world are they trying to sell a low budget piece of crap on late night tv with the promise of disturbing offensive sick garbage that any normal real human being with a soul couldn't watch the crap is funny about a dog being injured a grandma getting her head knocked guy getting his hand blown to pieces and two girls going to the bathroom what in the hell has this world come to that people find comedy in some thing so completely sick anyone who thinks this kind of material is funny should not even be allowed to walk the earth from what i hear its not even promise comedy through demented piles of sick they cant even pull that off
perhaps i couldn't find the dvd menu selection for plot on off clearly the default is off when the end credits began to roll i couldn't believe that was it like our poor but beautiful protagonist i felt used dirty characters were drawn in very broad strokes and the disdain for wealthy thatcherites was all to apparent i consider myself a roosevelt democrat but would appreciate a bit more course the problem could be with me i see that many others seem to find some meaning or message in this picture alas not i only thing that kept me from giving this a was the nice scenery human and plant
bullfighter was made in but it is being released on video years later for some reason i wonder why could it be the confusing storyline the incomprehensible dialogue said by oliver martinez and the annoying editing got to be i think the plot was mary forbes and jacque martinez go on a mystical road trip they meet a lot of wacky characters and avoid some evil ones too the movie looks great and there is a lot of style but there is no substance most movies when trying to subtle don't call attention to themselves with unanswered plot developments and weak special be fooled by the cover willem dafoe is in it for minutes at most
i rented this one to see vanesa talor one more time she can act but doesn't get a chance in this clunker the opening sequence is an elaborate crane shot of mountain landscapes must have come from a stock archive because the movie is shot direct to videotape the production values make look professional a really cheesy animated statue but no other effects worth noting this movie is bad but not amusingly so the players would do well not to mention it on their resumes
if you liked the first two films then i'm sorry to say you're not going to like this one this is the really rubbish and unnecessary straight to video probably tv made sequel the still idiotic but nice scientist wayne szalinski moranis is still living with his family and he has his own company szalinski inc unfortunately his wife wants to get rid of a statue wayne is so stupid he shrinks his statue and himself with his brother then he shrinks his wife and sister-in-law too now the adults have to find a way to get the kids of the house to get them bigger pretty much a repeat of the other two with only one or two new things a toy car roller coaster swimming in dip etc pretty poor
i first learned of the wendigo many years ago in one of alvin scary stories books according to that story the wendigo after calling your name in the wind drags you along and then pulls you up into the sky and pulverizes you while it sounds like a pretty bizarre notion story turned it into a fairly coherent movie wendigo doesn't it basically consists of every horror flick clich√© family moves to new house and strange things start happening anyone who harms them is asking for it and everyone had better listen to the old indian guy i've seen this stuff so many times that i no longer bother to avoid it patricia clarkson and erik per sullivan on malcolm in the middle have done far better than this
this movie is a bad attempt to make original fans feel complete the one thing people have forgotten is the fact that the reason the original won such acclaim was strictly do to the fact that it was supposed to make you feel movie makes me want to go to the washroom i am not a negative type of guy but man the acting in this flick is no comment the plot was a bad reflection of the life of carlito brigante and i am sorry to have had two hours of my time and my money wasted on this flick i still love the original and will do my best not to let this movie ruin my opinion about it
kalifornia is disturbing i believe there is no reason for this story to be told it is neither entertaining nor does it have social value technically the movie is very well make the performances are top rate and first class the story develops in an intriguing way that holds interest but at the end this movie sickens and is abhorrent to decency i recommend kalifornia to no one
i wrote a review of this movie further down after buying it on dvd and being sorely tried watching it again after reading a few of the comments made since then being a film student and making similar budgeted movies myself no budget shot on digi cam i stand by my original comments this is a no budget student project not a particularly good one released on to look like an award winning film you read the cover so deceving the public into thinking something not i want my money back under the trades description act complete rubbish
i picked this dvd up at the dollar store the dvd was on the for rack but since it had michael madsen in it i thought that since i had never seen the movie i bought it must say that i didn't like the movie the movie played more like a documentary or an advertisement for religion than anything else i found that the use of flashbacks did not add to the story line for me i would have preferred to view the story line in chronological won't throw it away like one of the other commentators but it may be quite awhile before i would consider watching this movie knows since it was michael film debut maybe it might have some archival value at some future date
save your money i have been a fan of fullmoon productions for a long time and i have never seen them make a movie as bad as this the casting is terrible the story is even worse and the special affects are worse than any movie iv'e seen sence the this movie is so bad i cant even suggest renting it
by far the worst movie of all time even yaphet kotto could not save this turkey i have heard that the movie was originally supposed to be titled the treasure but was changed to sharks treasure in order to take advantage of the excitement created by jaws i think sharks were in one scene of this movie the fact that they happened to be included in this thriller was supposed to sell tickets didn't work anytime something good happens in the movie the crew toasts each other with a certain brand of beer that had just been introduced at the time the movie was made gee do ya think that beer might have been a sponsor could they have made it any more obvious the only time anyone should break out the beer is if they make it through this thing cause enough for celebration
i bought bloodsuckers on ebay a while ago i watched parts and deemed it just too dumb to review again the excessive amount of watery blood at the beginning is just plain obsolete not to mention the whip-around wind sounds my friends and i made a super low budget movie and the effects still exceeded this crap for the amount of mistakes in this movie there are way too many to count i knew one of the actors believe it or not he was my theatre teacher ha verdict don't bother with this horror flick stars of a possible
i knew this movie wasn't going to be amazing but i thought i would give it a chance i am a fan of luke wilson so i thought it had potential unfortunately a lot of the dialog was very fake sounding and cheesy i think that aquafresh gave some money towards the production of the film because they were seriously dropping some hints throughout there is a shot where the aquafresh sign sticks out at you that you can't help but notice it maybe they should have focused on writing and acting more than how many times can we drop aquafresh products in the movie without people getting annoyed the movie had its moments but i'm glad i didn't spend to see it in the theater
i found the writing in this movie absolutely only thing that saved this movie from me rating it as a out of was lacy performance who i thought played the multiple personalities really well for me she was definitely the highlight of this meyer was pretty as always but i found her role pretty bland so i don't think one can say that her acting was for the male lead armand assante his interpretation of the role reminded me mainly of doctors in cheese hospital of that i could have lived with however the terrible terrible terrible the role of the psychic and even the role of psychic were just some of the worst writing i have seen in a long time
kathryn bigelow and mark boal are already preparing a sequel about a young us corporal in afghanistan he also happens to be a highly-qualified surgeon and is roaming freely around kabul operating on wounded nato soldiers on a particularly difficult mission he casually picks up a sniper rifle and shoots osama bin laden from a distance of about yards he is then finally promoted to sergeant but is unable to decide between a sniper and surgeon career so he quits from the army altogether one year later frustrated with civilian life he joins the navy and the last scene shows him proudly wearing a white uniform
it pains me to write such a scathing review but by not doing so i'm simply encouraging these people first off just because a film is made on a small budget does not automatically make it good nor endearing in fact in this case the small budget is probably the films sole achievement in that it prevented large sums of money from being squandered on a one legged race horse with the shits have you ever seen a comedy at the theatre ever heard people laugh and thought what the dickens are you on well even these twats weren't laughing things got so bad by mid way my cat took his first ever bath this is not film this is monkeys making images that leave you feeling like moving to france got to go a clown at my door
oh what a bad bad very bad movie cowritten by and starring sylvester should have been featuring too many rock-climbing scenes vertigo falling and scene-chewing villains and a botched airborne heist there are two plots both lame one involves a traumatic failed rescue and the other involves bad people wrecking an airplane for booty and killing various harmless people whenever possible the usually reliable john lithgow perhaps depressed by the sheer awfulness of the product is reduced to sneering and calling those for whom he doesn't care bostid in a vague approximation of an english accent janine turner who was sprightly and enigmatic when she played maggie on northern exposure is sadly wasted in the part of a rescue climber and pilot stallone is stolid and muscle-headed no deathless lines in this one no living lines either
this movie is just an excuse for the writer to make a film out of failed characters are just an assembly of characters with clich√© tragic or comic attributes the sum total of which is neurotic dialog like only woody allen could write woman love this because its like looking in the mirror so they will enjoy this film movies was not enjoyed by me however because there was no car chase and also the film didn't have any fights there was also no drug lords or gang bangers not to mention a lack of snakes this film had no snakes not my cup of tea and maybe not yours ether so think about what i have said before you find yourself watching this of course you resemble a female have weight issues man issues enjoy sex and the city and ally mcbeal then this is meaningful for you
friday the step over there is officially a worse movie than your hateful series out there i won this movie in a contest at college and it was a waste of money even if it was free jack jones stars as a truly awful singer whose trying to find some murderers or something at least friday the thirteenth never bored me i'd rather have my fingernails pulled than see this again
i very much looked forward to this movie its a good family movie however if michael landon editing team did a better job of editing the movie would be much better too many scenes out of context i do hope there is another movie from the series they're all very good but if another one is made i beg them to take better care at editing this story was all over the place and didn't seem to have a center which is unfortunate because the other movies of the series were great i enjoy the story of willie and missy they're both great role models plus the romantic side of the viewers always enjoy a good love story
that reviewers liked this movie surprises me the plot is a muddle the characters are wooden michael bowen spends most of the film spying on the other characters and misjudging all of them no one has any redeeming quality or point-of-interest this is not an edgy work it is not imaginative it is not ironic it is no clever there is nothing straight forward about this tedious work that is missed theatrical release is not surprise that the this network airs it diminishes that venue i definitely recommend turning to a rerun of the garden smart show on pbs or even a good informational if you encountered this mess on late night television if you encounter it on daytime television take a long walk even if you walk in smog you will feel better not having suffered through this shambles life is short this movie is long
caught part of george on tv recently but couldn't get myself to watch it through to the end just awful i can't even remember the plot all i know is that george and ursula were not the george and ursula of the first movie which was bad enough a lot of scrambling around but the direction and editing were so shoddy and choppy it was like watching outtakes or deleted scenes having the original voice of ape the ape back was not nearly enough to make me warm up to this george is probably the single worst sequel i have ever seen and that is saying something jeez because of lines rule i have to keep typing when i have nothing more to say about this crapulastic made-for-tv sequel disney hang your head in shame
this movie is god awful not one quality to this movie you would think that the gore would be good but it sucks bad the effects are worse and the acting if you can call it acting is the worst i've ever seen this movie was obviously shot on a camcorder and runs on a budget around dollars probably if you want to watch a good zombie movie than watch dawn of the dead or day of the dead if you want to watch a good cheap shot on video zombie movie like this but way better than watch redneck zombies please avoid this movie at all costs it is unwatchable and pointless you've been warned i've got nothing else to say about this stupid movie
i enjoyed the first comment far more than i did the film when i saw it at a second-run theatre in the early i was impressed then by the care taken to create costumes modelled so closely after the tenniel drawings but to me the cast was largely squandered their personalities muffled by the masks while the direction i think of as being unusually static and the photography murky the rating jotted down at the time was a nought which means not worth sitting through even i too would jump at a chance to have a second look
decent animation and some workable character development keep this animated horse fable from dreamworks at least watchable however it remains somewhat slow paced and the storyline is a bit on the silly side it is interesting to see a reversal of the typical cowboys and indian roles but here it just seems like a nod to political correctness rather than a proper storyline decision grade c
i absolutely hate this programme what kind of people sit and watch this garbage ok my dad and mum love it lol but i make sure i'm well out of the room before it comes on its so depressing and dreary but the worst thing about it is the acting i cant stand all detective programmes such as this because the detectives are so wooden and heartless what happened to detective programmes with real mystery i mean who wants to know what happened to fictional characters we know nothing about that died over years ago i wish the bbc would put more comedy on cos now with the vicar of dibley finished there is more room for crap like this
r o b o t j o the ending no and utterly the worst movie ever the adventures of pluto nash as the worst movie of all hate this utterly unacted unedited unscripted undirected unproduced mess of a thing called robot jox and i just found out they made a second one i apologize to adma sandler the beauticin and eddie murphy nash for hating their movies this mess of a thing makes those movies only bad not terrible horrible and grotesque like this thing this is the only movie for which i have ever said this remove it from netflix now out of people found this comment helpful
the movie has one nude scene a man sitting on the edge of the bed with his exposed genitals smack dab in the middle of the screen it is quite a long scene what was the point i almost think it was meant to be funny but we were watching it with my mother and it wasn't funny to have that staring at us for what seemed like a full movie is cold none of the characters are even likeable audrey tatou is cute of course but her character is an unhappy really would not recommend this movie i had expected it to be charming and fresh but it was depressing i wondered if the director was from a very upper crust educated french family and he looks down on these
this film looked promising but it was actually pretty bad the premise was but the plot itself was terrible the actors tried their best with limited material but they could not rise above the mean spiritedness of this tacky college film jason schwartzman was once again immensely irritating even more so than in rushmore the rest of the cast were quite non-eventful scenes that should have been fun turned out to be off-putting incredibly juvenile tries to be a road pie but fails dismally on all levels a total waste of time
this is surely one of the worst films ever made and released by a major hollywood studio the plot is simply stupid the dialog is written in clich√©s you can complete a great many sentences in the script because of this the acting is ridiculously bad especially that of rod cameron the choreography is silly and wholly unerotic one can only pity the reviewer who saw dance as sexual merely very bad choreography the ballet scene in the beginning is especially ludicrous if you are into bad movies and enjoy laughing at some of turkeys this is for you i bought the colorized version on vhs making the movie even worse heavy makeup when colored has her looking like a clown all the time and the best part of this film what a way to launch a career
i am a kind person so i gave this movie a instead of a it was without a doubt the worst movie that i've seen in a long time there was very little plot and the deeper interesting areas that were touched upon what jesus may really have wanted us to know were glossed over and instead we were given heavy visual doses of sadistic punishment inflicted upon our heroine total crucifixion in the first minutes would have been more humane to both her character and the audience the acting was barely there and the direction was uninspired and if i saw one more drip of water or dove flying toward the camera i may have started screaming louder than patricia
i can't believe i waste my time watching this garbage i did because leonard maltin gave it an aa rating and for tv movies this is usually a reliable indicator of some quality acting was ok but whoever wrote it should be forever denied access to any medium of communication the plot is ludicrous the motivations of the bad guys totally absent and the various family interactions silly and shallow for example dad preaches that violent reaction to aggression is bad but he turns out to be an admirable person not because of his ignore the idiots philosophy but because pretty good with his only message i was able to glean from this pap was that the nuclear family is good and alternate living arrangements are bad oh and bad people happen to good people
brilliant technology but what good does it do if the content is hollow and foolish i have left after than minutes of watching being bored and irritated theatre administration returned my money but the time waisted and aggravation remained i have been had and no thanks to the stars whose names were the main attraction meryl bill i hope you were well paid you might have even liked it so i apologies for my limited mind a lot of people seemed to like it too look at the comments oh to know what is remotely redeeming in a story about mr fox the husband the father the citizen the whatever
as many others have stated this is a terrible movie from every aspect of movie making how they ever got some known name actors to take on this project is people have complained that it was shot on cheap video cameras yes it was shot on video but not cheap video what made it bad was the lighting white balancing shooting technique and were so many different shooting and editing techniques used that it was a production mess harsh inconsistent lighting over use of hand held shooting woody allen choppy editing allen technique but poorly done without real lack of white balance in the restaurant kitchen scenes is embarrassing very simulated sex scenes had no acting value at any this video ever made it to print is beyond me it is worth watching if only to be amazed at how bad it is
you can tell they spent making is a waste of your time ugh there is not anything remotely good about this movie i don't know why i kept watching it the chick is not hot horrid acting you could do anything and its a better use of your time like watching tv playing shitty video games i feel robbed simply robbed of my time i have never made a review for a movie before as you can probably tell but this movie i felt like i needed to save the poor souls that are about to watch it and looking on imdb before to see if its decent and looking at the comments was no hot it screams bad movie whole movie is in a
just too many holes in this movie to be enjoyable and worse of all a bizarre almost hollywood-like ending that is completely out of context with the rest of the movie is not a spoiler as you will never guess how it will also need to be thick skinned to all sorts of politically correct undertones the conflict between whites and blacks was highly contrived and one sided i didn't understand why the author had the local black communinity behave in such an unacceptable manner is he she trying to be truly bizare movie only watch if you like to be really annoyed by holes in the plot and like to debate all the things that may or may not have supposed to have on the positive side the filming and acting is excellent
c'mon people you can't be serious another case of advertising snuff when it totally isn't this isn't even remotely scary nor is it terrifying or depraved it is just utterly terrible amateurish videowork made for the next party to get the girls gore is incredibly bad even the eye-scene is far from making me want to puke but just making me want to take the camera and hit those guys over the head the girl is just laying there rubber-faced not moving at all it would have been funnier to use a real doll season of i'm a celebrity get me out of here is more frightening than this one don't waste your time or your money
they played this on the july twilight zone marathon and this is hands down the worst twilight zone episode i've ever seen completely out of sync with the rest of the series in its tone even though twilight zone is a pretty uneven series and many episodes end up being groaningly predictable this one was completely out of place compare this to legendary episodes like a stop at willoughby or midnight sun and you realize there is no keaton did what he could with such terrible material and frankly it surprises me that someone of his historic comedy stature would stoop to the level of this episode even though he seemed to be giving it some effort he must have needed the money no other explanation
thoughtless ignorant ill-conceived career-killing is the talented angela jones now deeply unfunny garbage no wonder reb braddock hasn't directed anything else since anyone who has a chance to make his first film on his own rules based on his own script with the help of quentin tarantino himself and creates something like this anyone who feels that this was a story worth telling to the world doesn't deserve a second break under the circumstances the performances are good the actors do what they're told to do and they do it well just that they shouldn't have done it in the first place out of
this movie was strange i watched it while ingesting a quarter of psilcybe cubensis it was really weird im pretty sure you are supposed to watch it high but mushrooms weren't enough i couldn't stop laughing maybe lsd would work the movie is a bunch of things morphing into other things and dancing its really cheesy for todays standards but when it was released im sure it was well one of a kind i could see how some people would think this movie was good but i didn't think it was very interesting and i was on mushrooms at the time if your having a party or something and everybodys pretty lit pop it on you'll get a few laughs
this is one of the worst films ever i like cheesy movies but this is simply awful where are the images in the film that are on the box i think more money was spent on the dvd box illustrations than on the entire film would a company release a dvd that the cover is so misleading i feel like such an idiot for renting this movie based strictly on the box as much as i explore imdb i should have done a little research and made a list prior to visiting my local video rental store i have no one to blame except myself i want my money and time back not watch this movie if curiosity is motivating you stick cocktail umbrellas in your eyes instead it will be much more enjoyable you have been warned
i'm trying to picture the pitch for dark angel i'm thinking matrix i'm thinking bladerunner i'm thinking that chick that plays faith in angel wearing shiny black leather or some chick just like her leave that one with us only get this we'll do it without any plot dialogue character decent action or budget just some loud bangs and a hot chick in shiny black leather straddling a big throbbing bike fanboys dig loud bangs and hot chicks in shiny black leather straddling big throbbing bikes shallow dreary formulaic passionless tedious dull dumb humourless desultory barely competent live action anime without any action or indeed any life sf just the way joe fanboy likes it in fact
i feel much less generous with this film than others of its ilk the portrayal of madmen in this century is always done with them being so totally bizarre as to be a different species their antics are so outrageous as to be totally fictionalized everyone is napoleon or some other historical figure or they have a fascination with chickens they are on the make or beating each other up as if the scriptwriter said what can i make up for them to do without an sense of what insanity or even mental illness is watch the wonderful human portrayal in one flew over the nest where the illnesses are believable and real i once worked in a state mental hospital i didn't see any of these guys these are too smart and calculating to make them come to life
how irish critics rave about this movie is beyond me overacted by the usual band of irish actors dragged out for every irish movie terrible script with forced character quirks brown sauce romanticising all that is bad about dublin the attitude of ah a dump but sure isnt it great all the same plenty of tidbits purely for american audiences supermarket boss and his horribly forced catchphrase and the nail in the coffin was colm character a great actor forced to play this part that could've been written by a five year old cringeworthy stuff the best thing about this movie is farrell and a bad when you have to say that well at least he wasnt putting on his dreadful american accent international audiences be warned stay at home and watch snatch and lock stock you'll have a better time intermission is a walk-outer
first of all what is good in the movie some pretty actress the exotic background the fact that the actors don't laugh while acting would have if i had been in their situation i don't know the storyline is simple a catholic priest who does abstract painting tries to find out who abstract painter killed his little brother a male prostitute by another priest when he was young i'm afraid there is nothing here to learn or to let think a little about serial killers art or religion dennis hopper is not very good here this is the worst episode of the worst season of profiler serie with replacement actors and unbelievable coincidences uncle is the policeman who the girl who lives at another house could have a baby with the priest etc etc
it had to be you is another sign that hollywood is running out of ideas this picture is about charlie hudson a former police officer turned author when fianc√© goes out of town stuck with all of the wedding planning he spends a week at a fancy hotel and meets anna penn a teacher who just happens to also be getting married the two quickly become friends and set out to plan their separate weddings together this is when the plot gets boring charlie falls in love with anna and she has to choose between a safe life or charlie this movie rips off every romantic comedy ever made and just has you waiting for the end of the movie so you can do something else micahel vartan and natasha henstridge give really mediocre performances which just makes this movie all the more gut wrenching to watch
not sure who decides what category a movie fits into but this movie is not a horror movie as for the story it was fairly interesting but rather slow i was especially disappointed with the ending me why on earth does she run over to her home without at least calling the detective or the police first she knows exactly going on at that point plus she has a video tape as proof instead she runs over there and starts going nuts and saying i know everything i have proof you didn't expect proof did you then she acts surprised when her uncle stands up and starts walking over to her as if going to harm her well duh of course going to harm you idiot you just told him you know everything and have proof to expose everything what a dumb ending
give me my money back give me my life back give me a bit of credit this movie was vomit worthy useless and time consuming what a waste of energy and totally pointless okay i understand the premise and the idea sound but give us a break next time just give me the money and let me spend it lost child mothers remorse blamed husband clich√© get a life sorry but this movie was a total waste of my time my money and my being i would rather watch eggs cook no real explanation to why this happened prison why loss obvious but why acting deserves a what am i doing here oscar and the cinematography a am i just doing this for a wage how much did this movie make well this silly fool hired a copy enough said
the only reason i am bothering to comment on this movie is to save you all minutes of your life and maybe your bought it ex-rental for it looked interesting so i took a minutes of turning it on i realised i'd made a mistake the entire cast should be stored away until winter and then thrown on the nearest log fire where they could meet more of their for the devin hamilton and director he should just be shot sadly this should have been done before he made this this film if you see it in the shops run
as far as i can tell you in spite of earlier comments posted by other commentors this film is currently available on dvd i found it only a few weeks is on the value dvd label and i paid the grand total of cents plus tax for it i found it at a cent store among racks of plastic bowls and disposable chopsticks now don't you people who shelled out beau coup bucks for the super-duper swedish import limited edition version feel like you were had i thought film was indeed well worth cents cents i might start to argue with you but clearly worth cents and remember that saying about getting what you pay for for slasher film mavens only
no reason to bother renting this flick from the opening credits on i knew i was in was filmed as though it was a soft porn movie but there really isn't anything erotic about it the look into the world of sex addiction is intriguing but only to a sex scenes bad plot and cameos by ed begley jr and rosanna arquette aren't enough to save this film
if you're the kind of movie-goer who enjoys original content and intelligent look elsewhere kids cause sleepwalkers really sucks usually i'm more eloquent than that was bad i especially love it when charles offers tanya a ride home she declines and then he is seen walking home his car anyway just don't see it folks i really want to be more specific but words escape me cats jumping on people a guy getting stabbed by corn cheesey lines up the proverbial wazoo just don't see it wait i take that back see it for writer stephen cameo as the guy who owns the graveyard actually pretty good even with guest appearances by mark hamill and ron perlman king gives the best performance of the film but other than
i like the time period i like the attempt but watching a movie that looks like i'm looking at it through a coke bottle gives me a headache if i played computer games that were this blurry and out of focus i would upgrade my computer could be that this was the look the director was after but not so it hurts the eyes and you want to leave after minutes if i hadn't taken someone with me to this film i was out of there even though it was a series and not a movie per say band of brothers accomplished this they made it look like wwii footage with just a touch of graininess but it was still a pleasure to watch movies need real people with real sets and real locations use cgi when it is appropriate not for an entire film
this film is justly famous as one of the most horrible examples of propaganda ever produced the insistent equation of jews with disease is and even worse it almost becomes believable for brief its sheer repetition the fact that something this crude works is an object lesson in itself you have to have a strong stomach and a firm grip on yourself to sit through this and i wouldn't recommend trying unless you have a good reason
this is exactly the sort of saturday matinee serial i loved during world war ii i was under ten years of age and the audience this serial is designed for looking at it now one must roar at its ineptitude and stupidity the budget must have been next to nothing given the shortcuts and repeats the acting well this is republic pictures they read the no doubt had one take to make them and half stars
i love cheesy horror flicks i don't care if the acting is sub-par or whether the monsters look corny i liked this movie except for the bewildered feeling all the way from the beginning of the film to the very end look i don't need a page dissertation or a sign with big letters explaining a plot to me but dark floors takes the what is this movie about thing to a whole new level what is this movie isn't exceptionally scary or thrilling but if you have an hour and a half to kill you want to end up feeling frustrated and confused rent this winner
spencer tracy and katherine hepburn would roll over in their graves if they knew this guess coming to dinner rip off was actually in theaters along with sidney poitier and katherine houghton these four brilliant actors made a great cultural statement with director stanley master piece this present day rip off is a joke so a white guy from an overly stereotyped italian family in rhode island brings his african american girlfriend home gasp here to his grand funeral his family members reactions were of this movie was so painfully telegraphed from start to finish my girlfriend actually started fake snoring to signal to me that she wanted to leave do yourself a favor and rent the original take a pass on wake
my family and i screened underdog the night before and as bad as underdog is my four year old loved it hot rod makes it look like oscar worthy material the only thing that could have saved this movie was if evel himself had come out of retirement to slap samberg in the face for making this movie i will admit however that the soundtrack was good i wasn't sure if the movie was set in the but with the majority of the music coming from europe who knows if i were you i would take a pass and just stay at home and watch the test pattern on your local tv station or if you are dead set on watching this people under the influence might enjoy it
animal farm was a very good read about the dangers of totalitarianism how good ideals can be changed and distorted by those who are ignorant or rule with an iron fist and an empty head sadly this movie does not portray either of these what we're shown is a propaganda piece with a lot of finger waving and pointing the animation and the direction were good considering the budget and the time period but the very essence of george novel is sorely you're one of those who want to see how not to adapt a novel or are just interested in seeing an adaptation of this brilliant novelette then by all means watch i just found this one to be somewhat mediocre just one opinion remake is a notch below but not by much
dave sawa and his friends sam segel and jeff maronna have scammed their way through college when creepy ethan schwartzman discovers their secret he blackmails them into helping him score with beautiful good-hearted student angela and incompetent comedy a lot more groan-inducing than laugh-inducing movie tries appealing to its target audience with its disgusting gags but none of them work more full of worthless unappealing characters and character is so repulsive a major turn-off movie even tries using mamie van doren in the most outrageous scene bringing it down are its utter predictability and the waste again of veteran comedic actor joe talent this guy going to stop accepting every role that comes along and do something in all the only thing i liked was james jaime king who was very appealing and deserved gets no more than one out of ten from me
the worst and chock full of people who really ought to know better cast have six oscars between them set in contemporary africa was made in and is about the slave trade appallingly scripted and acted caine peter ustinov and william holden reach a career low in this one and completely lacks excitement never mind any moral focus also ludicrously plotted you don't for a minute believe that any of the characters would behave in the way they do under these circumstances richard fleischer directs but you get the impression it was over the telephone this is as bad as it gets
b movie at best sound effects are pretty good lame concept decent execution i suppose a put some olive oil in your mouth to save you from de poison den you cut de bite and suck out de poisen you gonna be ok stay by the airphone when agent harris calls you get me give me a fire we need weapons the silverware all we have is this price is the snake ers can handle the occasional snakebite alert every er in the tri-city area
no redeeming qualities can possibly be expressed i wish i could get my time back nice skull face broad really smiles bright at the camera when the disease has already wreaked enough havoc on the ill informed script i was happy to see all the characters dead or severely incapacitated by the end especially the party poopers that drink the tainted juice on their way to the alleged sunset eli roth does shine for moments of maybe ten putting forth the theory on how well weed smokes in the woods when others really fiend on top of beer consumption overall i found most of it pointless though not without gratuitous violence and not enough nudity happy to witness the demise of cast in a way though wishing that journey never happened should've been getting laid instead of watching tbs late night ugh
i don't know what it was about this film that made me react so viscerally against it perhaps it was the characters who so unlikable and were not compelling enough to care about perhaps it was the disorganized storyline perhaps it was the fact that rob lowe wore a long dangly earring and eyeliner perhaps it was because at some point in the movie they all break out in song perhaps it was because the were never that perhaps it was because everything was a garish hyperbole perhaps it was because a character pumps his fist while driving away from the camera during a fade out i don't know what it was that made me hate it so but if it means trying to watch it again i'm not willing to find out
nu image ufo and others produce films for the sci fi channel that come in with budgets of roughly million some feature extensive effects work others feature recognizable casts and still others feature both for hines initially claimed that this film was budgeted at million dollars but painfully obvious that this was probably produced for if not considerably less than that few sets are utilized a number of scenes are shot against green screen and most effects seem incomplete and painful to watch not so much because it is poorly directed poorly executed and misguided but because many of us have been following the progress of this production for quite some time and had high hopes for this film despite its relatively modest of us who believed in this movie when it was originally announced have joined the legions of those spoken of by barnum
the premise of the film is that thomas son was murdered and his wife was brutalized and he is given a chance at revenge when post traumatic stress disorder therapy he is put in a room with a man strapped to a chair and told this was the culprit he is given a large table of implements with which to offer retribution drills bats nails sledgehammers torches whatever you can think of that someone could possibly want to use to physically hurt another human go way too many scenes of torture before we figure out that the man archer is torturing is not the man who committed the crime the two then create an uncomfortable alliance who put them in this situation and when all is said and done we don't really care
at first i was convinced that this was a made-for-tv movie that wasn't worthy of primetime but after a few minutes of dumb-struck awe i realized that there was at least comic value in the over-the-top stunts and c-movie acting this movie would have gotten a if my wife and i hadn't laughed so hard as we watched it in wonder that the actors could keep a straight face it was like a less-funny spy version of the big hit laughed so much i actually bought the big hit dvd with even-worse acting we were disappointed that nick chose to marry elena and not jim after all of the hugging and high-fives a few rum and cokes will definitely help it go down easier
i always get frustrated by films that were obviously written by one gender especially when they obviously don't do enough research to find out when something not only doesn't ring true but rings blatently scene i am remembering is the one in the bathroom where jack tells his football teammates that he got diane pregnant in no way shape or form would a guy ever cheer another guy getting a girl pregnant in high school they might cheer about the guy having sex with the hot cheerleader but i can also guarantee that the first the football team heard about it would not be at a was obvious that this film didn't take itself so seriously and it wasn't hideously bad but come on
review of this cheap stv hits the nail squarely on the head make sure you read it in case you don't a group of scientists heads off into the deep woods of the pacific northwest to fumble around with a bunch of bones in an animal graveyard the big foot family doesn't take kindly to this and proceeds to pick off the team one by one largely offscreen big foot himself has a distinctly ape-like face but is less scary overall than harry from harry and the hendersons most of the movie has the wooden generic actors pretending to be scientists tromping around in the woods and yakking away this is a no-budget movie in which very little happens at least on screen we do get to watch the sexiest of the females take a shower while one of her male companions watches but nothing comes of this
just saw this movie on tv and i have to admit i was a bit surprised it was even on there were so many goofs mess-ups and bad editing that an old episode of sesame street would have been better to watch the acting was ok but please you can really feel the straight to video feeling the made this movie a bad melodrama yes there is a message in the movie but just wait until ten minutes before the ending to hear it trust me you wouldn't even tell the difference
i think my summary sums it up i found it inane and stupid i also saw the ending a mile a way everyone is copying that ending anymore when doing a crossover anymore sometimes better to let the movie stand its better to forget the movie altogether this is one of the others
this is really really bad lamas shows just how a second rate actor does his job but what makes it worth watching is the scene where oj angrily grabs a fellow cop by the throat as if to kill them while the jukebox plays a song with the lyric i got the evidence on you me want to hear the rest of the lyrics attributed to david gregoli and leslie oren but i couldn't find it on itunes talk about seeing into the funny for words the rest of the movie is forgettable the score and songs are more interesting than the script ditto the sequel which begs the question of why they would do a sequel at all my understanding was that foreign sales drives a lot of these b movies doesn't say much for the viewing habits
i missed the beginning but i did see most of it a friend got it on dvd in the cheap room at skits are all very short and yet most of them are still too long the majority of them they seem to have forgotten to have something funny quite a lot of humor in it skits based on stereotypes or skits which use racist terms for trying to remember anything i thought was funny in it and i'm having trouble the logo for the tunnel vision network is a lipsticked mouth with an eyeball in it the mouth opens and closes over the eye like eyelids kind of a disappointment most of the actors went on to better things and lucky this bomb didn't hold them back
ummm please forgive me but weren't more than half the characters missing in the original novel valjean is a man imprisoned for years for stealing a loaf of bread and then attempting several times to escape he breaks parole and is pursued relentlessly by the police inspector javert along the way there are many characters that weren't in this version some worth mentioning would be fantine cosette m mme thenardier eponine marius gavroche and enjolras the only character with the same name is javert i was confused and frustrated throughout the whole movie trying to see how it was in any way connected to victor epic novel
i don't like this film but then i didn't think much of the book either which although lauded by many as a masterpiece i found lacking in character development and disjointed and illogical in plot although it was far more readable than dreadful first effort road to los angeles not published until fante became fashionable in the mid was intrigued to see what sort of soup towne would make with such meager ingredients he has worked hard script-wise to repair the many shortcomings of the book but for my money didn't rescue it there was never a movie in ask the dust while ever he tried to stay faithful to the book i consider this film a word forgettable
how can such good actors like jean rochefort and carole bouquet could have been involved in such a a well such a thing i can't get it it was awful very baldy played some of the few leading roles the jokes are dumb and absolutely not funny i won't talk more about this movie except for one little piece of advice do not go see it it will be a waste of time and money
any film which begins with a cowhand shagging a female calf can't promise much as for the stereotyping of the kibbutz as it was yrs ago well i was there and it just wasn't like that ok every kibbutz had just a small piece of something shown in the film youngsters raiding the kitchen at night but you can't show the whole kibbutz as being full of all those shall we say naughty traits each kibbutz had its own problems but hardly any kibbutz had all of them the views of israel were great i still remember my youth in that garden of eden called the emek yes and the acting was good too so you see it wasn't all black just a wrong portrayal probably on purpose too
although it got some favorable press after playing at the toronto intl film festival there were a number of reasons not to expect too much from this one an ultra-low budget canadian film two written directed and starring the same person a bad sign unless woody allen george clooney or one or two other respected filmmakers but despite my watching it with lowered expectations it still turned out to a far bigger disappointment than i thought a nutshell bad script bad acting terrible directing don't waste your time or money on this turkey it claims to be a comedy but i only laughed twice plus there is awful music blaring throughout how this got any attention i'll never know
i watched this on a whim because it was available and i'd heard the thumb movies were funny this one was not the majority of the jokes were based around physique and in turn kate i think really pathetic of the the thumbtanic creators to stoop so low to make jabs at a respected actress just because she forbid doesn't starve herself into the model of ideal modern favorite part was the line that goes something like hey i have a great idea swim over to this makeshift raft that no one else seems to see thirty seconds of amusement out of a minute movie does not redeem its value
the master of cheap erotic horror rolfe kanefsky finally makes a movie that doesn't go straight to the playboy channel the hazing borrows heavily from everything that came before it from nightmare on elm street to evil dead but still manages to do it with enough humor to make it watchable just barely the characters are cardboard the dialogue is wooden the story is paper-thin and the actors couldn't act their way out of a grocery bag put that all together and you have a pulpy ball of mulch for a movie sometimes when i'm bored i like to eat paper watching this movie is a lot like that chew on it for minutes and you're left with a weird taste in your mouth and no nutritional value
this movie is so bad that i cannot even begin to describe it what in the blazing pit is wrong with the writers producers and director how on earth did they get funding for this abomination the plot is laughable the acting is poor at best the story what story the first fight in this movie is ok but then it keeps repeating itself until you want to turn it guess i'm the biggest looser for not turning this stupid movie off after the first spoler alert only saw this movie because scott adkins was in it and he is in it for give it out of because the lowest grade imdb has to yourself a favour see an uwe boll movie instead twice more worthy of your time
wow what can i say about this film a lousy piece of crap i'm surprised that it got rated as high as it did wrong with this film a better question not wrong with this story itself is just crap and clich√© pretty much what kinda nerdy kid with no friends gets picked on gets killed and comes back as a scarecrow for revenge all of that is packed into minutes of worthless film if you haven't seen this movie don't waste your time watching it also the second one isn't much better so don't bother watching that rated this movie a three because i liked the outfit not because there was anything good about the movie i think you get the picture
i too was intrigued by the high rating for this film and was very disappointed i had just seen a couple of good foreign films and was looking forward to making it three in a row but it was not to be i went with a spanish speaking friend who felt the same way there is not much of a plot if any i don't necessarily need that in a movie but it needs to somehow entertain or bring me in the best i could say would be that it aspires to be an altman-esque film albeit with an extremely small ensemble sure there are moments but a few moments easily get thinned out by slow minutes of nothing i do not understand the high rating for this film i give it a
complete drivel an unfortunate manifestation of the hypocritical toxic culture of a decade ago in this movie pedestrian regrets for slavery go hand in hand with colonialist subtexts annoying redhead feeding shaka rice forget historical reality too didn't most western slaves comes from west africa an american slaver easily capturing shaka with a handful of men finally david hasslehoff could not have been any more obnoxious one can only ponder how would he have fared in the miniseries impaled most likely the miniseries was superb and it is unfortunate that dh should have gotten his hands on something unique and made it mundane tend to think that he had hand in creating this fiasco
spoilers i the absolutely absurd logic of the ending ruins the entire movie i just couldn't get over it and what is wrong with mark character if i suddenly found myself crashed-landed on a planet full of talking apes i'd be all like aaaahhhhhhh run for your lives the monkeys have inherited the earth but all like talking apes okay next pretty jaded i'd say he must run into even stranger things on a regular basis besides that this is rick best work yet this film is a true testament to how far we've come in the monkey makeup field
the pakage implies that warren beatty and goldie hawn are pulling off a huge bank robbery but not what i got out of it i didn't get anything in the first half a new character introduction in every other scene the first half-hour is completely incomprehensible the rest is just one long annoying underlit chase scene always an irritating sound in the background whether a loud watch ticking a blaring siren a train whistling or even the horrible score by quincy jones there are a lot of parts that are laughably bad too like the bad guys chasing beatty on thin ice with a car or the police arriving at the scene roughly fifteen times i really hated this movie
i saw the version of deathstalker iii and loved the movie so much even unmystied that i decided to watch the entire series of deathstalker films i bought i and ii and settled down for a about deathstalker i was funny on any level and when the credits rolled i was embarrassed and regretful that i had bought it too much ugliness and nudity i guess either ds was a much cleaner production or really edited a lot because i expected something similar stupid and carefree and simple i was wrong even at it seemed a waste of money i didn't even open ds as i will return it tomorrow now i'll probably just throw away this dvd as i can't return it and no one wants it including myself so really don't bother with this one even the nudity of it btw is uninspiring and icky
what i hate about this show is how poorly the leads are written these women have no self-respect or dignity the entire plot is them throwing themselves at guys amanda bynes talent is completely wasted she was brilliant on all that and her own show why they would write her and jenny garth as vapid airhead desperate men chasing old-maid wannabes is beyond plots and dialog remind me of the simpons homer says whenever his cartoon character poochie is not on screen everyone should ask poochie all the talk centers on whining about some guy and then whining to some guy sometimes they change it up and the guy whines instead then they get back together or break up at the end the women are either shallow stupid or sex addicts the only word i can think of is sucks
why this was an insipid uninspired and embarrassing film the embarrassment comes from being from the city where they made pa why did they let these people do such a baaaaad movie this movie was originally to be was more of a romantic no robo-anything that all got changed along with cuteness courtesy of disney why they did a terrible interpretation of this classic comic character seeing matthew broderick make fun of his own movies was not fun either sheesh
whack i got this movie because elizabeth hartman was in it i was disappointed to find out she was in like two short scenes towards the end other than that i was basically hitting the fast forward button the entire time some teenager goes on a trip to romania with his dad and gets bitten by a wolf and turns into a werewolf if a full moon he kills his father and friends about years past but he doesn't age a bit and enrolls in a high school there he meets a shy teacher whom he ends up biting and then has kids with her this movie sucked and i don't recommend it to anyone read war and peace instead only ms hartman did a great job check out a very young bob saget in this one
just saw this at the chicago film festival avoid it at all costs unless you have sleep problems it is a film filled with pretensions it opens with a minor quote from hiroshima mon amour and all downhill from there camera work imagine a child trying to imitate wong kar wai story line smokey robinson and the miracles the love i saw in you was just a mirage expanded from minutes to over hours but filled with repetition for butt numbing pain this film ranks with the benches at the methodist church my parent dragged me to when i was a kid i want hours of my life refunded julian promoter prefaced the viewing with comment that the film was controversial that is true only for the narcotic effect
i rated this movie as awful after watching the trailer i thought this movie could be pretty cool guaranteed to the trailer said did offend me because this movie really sucks it is hardly a comedy as i laughed about two seconds during the entire movie and with all the gays in this movie i'm not gay and i don't have a problem with those who are but the point of adding so many gay-scenes in a so called comedy movie when these scenes are absolutely not funny i guess the director is a gay man in denial or something like my advice to you is if you want to waste good money go rent a good comedy you've already seen a million times you'll be better off than watching this mother of all lousy it really is total crap
bad plot bad dialogue bad acting idiotic directing the annoying porn groove soundtrack that ran continually over the overacted script and a crappy copy of the vhs cannot be redeemed by consuming liquor trust me because i stuck this turkey out to the end it was so pathetically bad all over that i had to figure it was a fourth-rate spoof of springtime for girl who played janis joplin was the only faint spark of interest and that was only because she could sing better than the you want to watch something similar but a thousand times better then watch beyond the valley of the dolls
i have seen many many films from china and hong kong this is the worst no the worst one was unknown pleasures i watched platform yesterday evening and thought that jia zhang other two films must be better this evening i was disappointed again i will not be watching xiao wu tomorrow evening because i have just placed all three films in the bin whoever gave this film platform ten out of ten needs to watch more cinema the photography was very poor it was very difficult to differentiate between some of the characters because of the lack of close-up work the storyline was so disjointed that i fast-forwarded it towards the end out of pure frustration i would not recommend this film to anyone give me zhang yimou or chen kage any day these are true masters of chinese cinema not pretentious con men
with adam is without a doubt one of the most idiotic films ever made about cruise ship waiter shecky wanting to be a comedian on the cruise ship first off there is not one funny or clever line in the entire movie honestly it is so unfunny pathetic there is surprisingly not much crude or sexual humor but the f-word is plentiful the budget is really low and that also ruins the film it takes place on a cruise ship but it seems they only had money to rent out a small boat and only had money for ship extras one of which is billy bob thornton the opening credits are animated reeeeeaally cheaply and it is just pathetic i hate this movie and everyone else that sees this will hate it mins rated r for language
laughter is a state of mind says the tag and i hesitate to comment on barry what could he have been thinking during the making of toys when he watched the rushes did he see a successful funny fantasy if so then working on a different plane than i this is an excruciating picture one in which the production design is of the thing even the cartoon colors are a disappointment robin williams and especially joan cusack are humiliated as brother and sister of a toy mogul who are bypassed as inheritors of the factory when their dad dies nothing remotely funny or slapstick-wise on display here it is uniformly draggy ugly and one of the very worst big movies ever made no stars from
i happen to be the nephew taken me years to get my hands on a copy of this film and i can confirm that it is indeed one of the worst movies of all time my uncle doesn't even have a copy of it anymore asked i'm looking forward to bringing him a the average rating is as far as i can tell that should put it somewhere in the in the imdb bottom however with only votes it hasn't yet sad that the film doesn't even get the respect of a bottom i'm giving copies of the movie to family members this year for holiday gifts gift ever
inventor wayne szalinsky moranis is preparing to donate his problematic machine to the smithsonian institution as he and his wife diane gordon get ready for a long weekend away from their son adam hall brother gordon pankin his wife patty bartlett and his kids jenny mack and mitch richardson volunteer to look after adam while his parents are away but as luck would have it the title would lead you to expect the grown-ups are accidentally zapped by shrinking ray as the kids run amok their miniaturized folks must contend with monstrously huge insects wrinkles in the carpet that look like canyons and other threats to them this was bad like most straight to video sequels are honey we shrunk ourselves was sort of laughable i had to laugh at that movie roach stuart pankin and the party bullies were even more ridiculous view at own risk
i have to finish watching a movie once i start regardless of how bad it is this movie was agonizing to sit through the sparkling bullets the reporter with ninja like moves the way the bad guys shoot hundreds and hundreds of bullets and only seem to hit innocent bystanders the predictable outcome and all the bad acting was just horrible like the girl who finds the reporter in her friends apartment and goes from what the heck are you doing in here a bat to hey you're cute wanna in like seconds just bad save yourself an hour and forty minutes and go play with your kids dog
this film on paper looked like it could possibly be good after watching though i realised that this film was completely terrible the plot has no meaning and i think i counted the best part of cut scenes each one making the film more annoying boring and ridiculous i watched this late night pitch black no noise at all just to add to the scariness of it but the truth is the only thing that scared me was the music what they would call tragic music they play opera i mean be serious this film sums up all of what is not good about this type of film to be honest ill say no more but watch at your own risk this film is just complete rubbish enjoy
this movie was a real disappointment to me i have been a fan of gram parsons for a long time and when i found out they were making a film about him i was very exited i got the movie on vhs when it came out and was sickened by what i saw this film wasn't about his life it was about the aftermath of his death i thought it would be a descent film about grams life and music but they had to make a film about his death i am tired of hearing about his deaths in books and movies i wanted a film about his life not his infamous death i was very disappointed i wish people would look at his life more then his death the only thing good about this film was its soundtrack this film is a disappointment to any gram parsons fan
firstly i would like to point out that i only know of the show due to my younger sister always watching it i find it the most annoying program on tv there is nothing funny about any of the jokes and the canned laughter is unbearable the show would work much better if filmed in front of a live audience that way the laughter would show just how unfunny the show is however i give credit to the acting talents of the young cast it sickens me however to think that they'll look back on the show in the future and see how bad their first tv show was the show links in well with the overall annoying voices and style of the cbbc presenters why the youth of today need to be shouted at so much is beyond me that is all
frankly i'm rather incensed that on the basis of the dazzling reviews attributed to steven smith i wasted nearly two hours on his debut offering have they all been written by his pals the action clunks along the music is irritating and over used the script is simply dire and the actors the exception of the gardener mediocre at best i do think we should support the efforts of a young filmmaker but saying brilliant when not will surely only encourage him to make the same mistakes again continuing to write his own scripts and using the same actors for another venture yes his first film low budget etc i get it but also out there for members of the public to purchase and just not up to scratch
this is perhaps the worst attempt at a zombie film i have ever had the misfortune to see terrible terrible terrible any review found on this site is obviously the work of either the filmmaker the filmmakers family or a friend of the filmmaker how does this film suck let us count the plot incoherent dialogue atrocious i will not slam the as i understand that this is low budget but was there even one zombie that was not obese c'mon and for a film set in rhode island why did that truck sport a massachusetts plate continuity find girl dancing while the soldier stands at attention please don't put your ex-girlfriend or sister in your movie naked this was an ugly movie filled with ugly people and has no business even mentioning romero on the cover next time you decide to make a movie don't
i saw this film last night minutes and don't know what kept me in my seat i guess i just expected a film with gere would have some value in it eventually but nothing of value ever came on the screen the story is a silly excuse to pile on shot after shot of bondage and torture there is not a character in the film that does anything like real life the cutting style relies on jump cuts mini flashbacks and overprinting to give weight to this vapid setup of a gang of sadists apparently running free for years and surprise the leader is the victim of an executed killer i don't see how gere a buddhist got involved in this violent sexist trash
i think scarecrows are creepy so a pity this movie doesn't make more of them bunch of robbers do an emergency parachute from a plane into a enormous field with scarecrows one of them goes missing with the loot and so the rest chase him down while being set upon by inexplicably evil scarecrows the acting is hammy and the scarecrows unimpressive they move on the positive side the director does get some suspense out of the static scarecrows it is as alfred hitchcock says a bomb under a table goes off and surprise we know the bomb is under the table but not when it will go off and suspense
i find it sad that christians i am one feel that we must make movies like left behind we have much better stories to tell that don't have to be so preachy i was very disappointed with this film as an aspiring filmmaker who believes in christ i see this film as the perfect example for what i am not going to do with my career in film
i myself am a big fan of low-budget horror films this isn't the worst but still not to spectacular the plot line is decent but drags out way too long you're through half the movie before you even get to see any zombie action the kills aren't very creative and the zombies aren't too crafty i truly think this movie would have been better if they left out the zombies and just made it into some mafia flick watchable but i feel that this film did steal at least an hour of my life i'll give the film credit for being somewhat original if you are really into b horror movies worth a viewing but if you're not don't bother but you don't have to take my word for it
this movie wasn't that bad when compared to the first two sequels to the original directed by martin kitrosser of friday the fame the acting is very bad indeed but the gore and special effects help make it interesting thats one thing i like about screaming mad george up effects artist for the film his effects are so off-the-wall and bizarre that they will keep you watching a bad movie just to find out how crazy they're gonna get the movie isn't really all that gory but there is an extremely nasty eyeball-munching scene in the middle involving a toy maggot mickey rooney makes a guest appearance that he probably wasn't too enthusiastic about but needed the money at the time possibly if you liked the weirdo installment favorite of all you'll probably like this one i liked it better than the matrix enjoy
just so that you fellow movie fans get the point about this film i decided to write another review i missed a few things out last the script second the acting third jesus christ what were they thinking making a piece of garbage like this and then expecting us to enjoy it when there are no redeeming features whatsoever from beginning to end except when joseph fiennes finally gets blown away in a very unexciting can't believe i wasted my money on this when i could have given it to a homeless person or a busker or you getting the picture
below average movie with poor music considering a movie based on music ordinary script direction with full of blunders salman khan was at his usual acting performance deteriorating with time as his his styles as a rock star were pathetic asin was just a showpiece only overall i felt like wasting my money in cinema salman khan remains as immature as years ago compared to aamir khan there were many songs in the movie all boring except man ko ati the most important song to impress the uk music sponsor was most unimpressive khanabadosh can be very easily understood by an english music sponsor the other movie i saw last week was wake up sid which was simple slow love story with good direction acting despite average music
too bad i really like kristen cloke and gary busey but the director failed to put this together a lot of action a lot of promise but it all comes off hokey the director didn't do his job promising action comes off lame so much seems contrived in a desperate attempt to save the film this version of the rage credits it as simply isn't worth the time to watch it another director would have done a better job
i am a great fan of david lynch and have everything that made on dvd except for hotel room the hour twin peaks movie so when i found out about this i immediately grabbed it is this a bunch of crudely drawn black and white cartoons that are loud and foul mouthed and unfunny maybe i don't know good but maybe this is just a bunch of crap that was foisted on the public under the name of david lynch to make a few bucks too let me make it clear that i didn't care about the foul language part but had to keep adjusting the sound because my neighbors might have all in all this is a highly disappointing release and may well have just been left in the deluxe box set as a curiosity i highly recommend you don't spend your money on this out of
when you get your hands on a british film you expect some sort of quality and when it comes to acting camera work lighting etc this film does the business done by highly skilled craftsmen that alone can bring you an enjoyable one and a half hours but when you look under the layers of professionalism you don't really find anything apart from making you feel good and advocate a drug liberal view really nothing there the script is mediocre the plot is predictable and the ending must be one of the worst east of hollywood in all english cosiness just a shameful and cynical attempt to make another full monty why they made this film i haven't got a clue apart from making money of course
this really is the worst film i have ever seen ever period i actually paid to watch this steaming turd of a movie incredibly dull poorly acted dire script often incoherent and too many scenes that don't seem to have any relevance to the overall film when heath priest partner nailed to a wall by a was the point in that scene answers on a postcard should have got a medal for sticking with this film for entire running time i would rather take a strong kick to the groin than sit through this film should be cast into bottom hopefully my vote of will help it on way
marilyn miller made only three films before her untimely death the marvelous sally the comedy her majesty love and this trifle sunny it is quite poor both as an early talkie and as an attempt at a musical although she has four dance numbers she only sings two songs and one man alone the rest of the score including the spritely title tune are jettisoned although we can hear the latter in the background scoring miller looks overweight and amateurish here no star quality at all even her dancing is cloutish the film is very badly written stock full of stale and unfunny jokes and stupid situations if you're interested in miller as a performer by all means check it out but for general entertainment stay away
poor whoopi goldberg imagine her at a dinner party and she adds a comment to the in-depth political discussion going on people just look at her and say oh what would you know you were the star of theodore rex how could anyone take her seriously after she lowered herself to be the star of this appalling piece of crap even little kids would be cringing in horror at this thing it reminded me of a particularly bad episode of sigmund and the sea monsters actually come to think of it sigmund was vastly superior to however did it get made by plying the producer with an illegal substance before telling him about it watch this hideous abomination at your own peril
after the overrated success of amenabar and balaguero spanish horror movies spread like a disease in the increasingly sad world of horror movies the result is all in films like el segundo nombre a tv-like production bad written but acted and directed even worse i didn't read the ramsey campbell book but i'm sure that the author of the doll who ate its mother didn't have much in common with this terrible production avoid it at any cost unless you're searching for a quiet sleepy night in a fresh movie theater
but this movie was a bore the history part was fine but the musical part was not not one song i cared about and no soundtrack to be sweet jesus was suppose to be comic relief it never work if john adams was suppose to be the obnoxious annoying one the rest of them were trying to overthrow him in every and jefferson were the only bearable characters in the whole historical quotes and the debate about slavery in their historical context were interesting enough but not enough to overcome the lack of music in a you be humming the songs after a musical except for a few chirps nothing else was worth the breath
did i miss something here this adaptation has everything that brookmyres first novel had everything apart from the story the laughs the black humour the political intrigue the characterisations the plot and some semblance of from beginning to end they made a mockery of the plot they had a romance between parablane and a cop and what was that all about dr slaughter was portrayed as a bystander and who the hell was annette crosby supposed to looked like they had made a three hour adaptation then chopped it down to minutes though the minutes seemed to last forever please please do not do this to any other of brookmyres books country of the blind
i have two very major complaints regarding this that my local rental store shelved what is very clearly a soft core porn in the suspense category i known what it was i would not have wasted my time renting it in the first place and yes this movie is a soft core the title has nothing to do with the movie no one in this movie does anything that is either deviant or obsessive let alone a combination of the make that three major that i for some reason watched the movie long enough to discover point number two on this list boy do i regret that stay away from this movie learn from my mistake this movie is valueless on virtually every level
i remember watching attack when it first came out and caught it again recently the sci fi channel has run worse but not by much a shameless ripoff of jurassic park attack substitutes sabertooth cats for dinosaurs and they are on the loose devouring as many extras as possible the cgi is pretty bad and closeups of prosthetic cat heads are laughable we get some gore which helps a little wait until you see how the mad scientist who started this whole mess gets it other than robert carradine who has very little to do the cast is unknown apparently this was shot in fiji nice work if you can get it reminds me of all those low-budget monster stvs that were popular in the and
i was looking on imdbs bottom because i thought id never seen anything as bad as plan from outerspace or roller ball remake i was wrong ben and arthur has beaten out of the many countless amount of movies i've seen is the number one worst film on the i ever saw bad directing bad characters horrible acting horrible story a reason nobody but sam ever says anything positive about this film sam was a horrible annoying actor but his directing was so bad he may just overthrow ed director should be ashamed of his work unfortunately i have to give it at least star but it deserves to be continued stars
i went to see this movie with my daughter i insisted we go the matin√©e showing not because i'm a tightwad but just feeling i had in the nascar spirit this is a dream so much blatant advertising it almost qualifies as an info-mercial if it weren't for the so-called acting keeping with tradition the herbie franchise continues with its cheesy story lines the car is only a vehicle pun this cornball of a motion picture earlier herbie installments cheesy as well were produced during more serious times making them a little easier to digest ms lohan reigning drama queen has little acting ability i was surprised that mr keaton and mr dillon would get involved in such a project only the snack bar was a bigger ripoff
following a car accident a mad evers keeps the head of his he then goes on the prowl looking for the perfect body to make her whole again pretty lame all the way around nothing redeeming here also in the cast are leslie daniels bonnie sharie and bruce brighton someone should have helped put this one out of its misery let it die
this film reminds me of how college students used to protest against the vietnam war as if upon hearing some kids were doing without cheeseburgers in cow dung collehe the president was going to immediately change all us foreign worst thing is that while dangerous the concept of a policy based on if the ussr and us went to war it could mean the end of the world worked the us and ussr never went to we only conventional weapons the notion of yet another war a win-able war in europe and asia was not that i think they should get rid of this movie it should be seen by film students as a splendid example of how not to make a should be stars or maybe black holes
i am working my way through the chilling classics movie pack collection and the witches mountain monte de las something like the movie in the movie had nothing to it to hold my attention at all the plot was incoherent the dialog seemed improvised the acting was poor the characters were best scene is the beginning with an exasperated woman that is driven to burning her seemingly bratty daughter however the only connection this scene has to the rest of the movie is the lead character mario who has the most stupendous mustache ever but film was not effective on any level the music was too intrusive the lighting was very dark so that some scenes are almost completely black it really is barely watchable what more can i say
the most positive thing i can say for this dull witted local comedy production is that inoffensive in fact so astonishingly bland that one wonders how many dozens of re-writes by committee it went through to have such a complete removal of personality not witty not entertaining not insightful and not charming just a staid laughless progression of four losers who must change their ways and their attitudes towards women to be allowed to attend their best acting that would be sub par for the local amateur dramatics society a plot line so tired it'd make a forty third season of allo allo look fresh and jokes about as humorous as watching decaying vegetables wedding nonetheless scored ten nominations in the nz film awards somebody saw sense and it didn't win any
an absolutely crappy film this is how or why this movie was made and what the hell billy bob thornton and charlize theron were doing signing up for this mediocre waste of time is beyond me strong advise for anyone sitting down to catch a flick do not waste your time on this film
i only rented this because i loved the first movie however calling it john carpenters vampires los muertos is just a con trick to get you to rent it he is in fact executive producer and clearly had nothing to do with the making of this film creepers tragic storyline terrible special effects and jon bon jovi as the least convincing vampire hunter of all time not even comically we end up with is a dull uninvolving film with a terrible script and indefinsibly bad and clich√©d acting it just reeks of low like the bubonic plague
play mystery theater at home with your friends rent this movie for the laughs the acting is poor the sounds is terrible and the fights are ridiculously unbelievable i thought the movie was a joke until i looked it up on imbd i can't wait to rent the sequel china o'brien ii
this really should deserve a o rating or even a negative ten i watched this show for ages and the show jumped the shark around series this episode however is proof that the show has jumped the shark writing is lazy absurd self-indulgent and not even worthy of rubbish like beavis and is quite possible to be ridiculous and still be fun pirates of the caribbean the mummy count of monte cristo all fun movies that are not to be taken seriously however there is such thing as ridiculous as in this is the worst thing i've ever seen and indeed this is the worst episode of stargate i've ever seen absolutely dreadful and this coming from someone with a stargate in her me want to sell all of my stargate props most seriously
as a member of the cast i was a member of the band at all the basketball games i would like to let the world know after being in the movie that we were not allowed to see it since it was banned in oregon this was due to the producers and the director breaking the contract with the university of oregon where it was shot seems that the u of o sign was shown while we were shooting we were allowed to eat several meals with the cast and production staff mr nicholson was quite memorable for being one of the most ill-mannered men i have ever met quite a time for a young year old but certainly not what campus life was really like in the late and early despite what hollywood may think trombone player from oregon
omg this was the most painful experience of my life watching this i could even finish it what is happening to nick their best thing on teen nick is drake and josh and thats about to go off air the kids songs are kinda of annoying and the so are the kids my little sister wanted to watch the show because she likes anything that comes on disney or nick usually but after finish watching this show she said one of the worst shows that i have ever saw so boring my little brother actually fell asleep i envy him in short if your old with no brain activity you'll enjoy this show otherwise change the channel now
there are a lot of highly talented in germany now none of them are associated with this in the world do producers actually invest money in something like this this you could have made good films with the budget of this garbage not entertaining to have seven grown men running around as dwarfs pretending to be funny what is funny though is that the producer happens to be the oldest guy of the bunch is playing the youngest film is filled with moments that scream for captions saying you're supposed to laugh now hard to believe that this supposed to be a people actually stood up and left the cinema minutes into the movie i should have done the same instead of wasting my
here is what head of needs to make programmes aimed at different audience to and to keep licence and lenny henry offers his unfunny friends head of snaps them up completely ignoring the fact that they are not of all it is arguably racist as all the characters play up to bad stereotypes if a white person did this kind of thing there'd be
i was extremely suspicious of the ideas presented in this movie but being relatively ignorant of quantum physics aside from what i recalled from the excellent short history of nearly everything and what i was able to choke down in a brief history of time it sounded interesting at times however the obvious nonsense of the story of the indians being unable to see the ships of the explorers was ridiculous i really started questioning what was being shoveler at that point but then the clincher was the revelation that one of the speakers was actually channelling some loony named ramtha completely upset the applecart for a waste of two hours
this must have been an embarrassment to every member of the entirely african-american cast every derogatory disparaging stereotype of the black american community is featured prominently i won't reinforce the insults by listing them here except to mention chickens watermelons and good song by ethel waters a couple of bad ones and the fantastic singing and dancing talents of sammy davis bring the total up to something below on the imdb scale
knowing enki comics for quite some time i had to see this movie i have thought this would be a good way for the artist as bilal to spread his art and ideas to wider audience i have also thought this would be a good movie to recommend and i thought i will enjoy watching it i was wrong the movie was a true torture to watch the idea has potential but movie leaves way too much to be desired and basically everyone who sees this movie is left with impression that he could do it better i will not make suggestion whether you should see this movie or not chances are if you're reading these pages that you have already seen it or that you're gonna see it but be prepared for very bad minutes
this was the worst movie i saw at worldfest and it also received the least amount of applause afterwards i can only think it is receiving such recognition based on the amount of known actors in the film great to see but only in the movie for a few minutes is a much better actress than the part allowed for the rest of the acting is hard to judge because the movie is so ridiculous and predictable the main character is totally unsympathetic and therefore a bore to watch there is no real emotional depth to the story a movie revolving about an actor who can't get work doesn't feel very original to me nor does the development of the cop it feels like one of many straight-to-video movies i saw back in the and not even a good one in those
slash flicks come few and far between now a days so when i heard about cut i had high hopes and heard good things about it those good things i heard were all wrong this flick is bad and i mean bad just plain stupid everything about it especially the origin and how he stays alive and how he is taken care of in the end there is nothing original or outstanding about this flick just another slasher wannabe with those hip self aware movie savvy characters i'm so sick of that crap someone do something different cause the slash genre needs new blood literally
this time we get a psycho toy maker named joe petto it who makes living evil toys that kill people he goes after the family who has the bad luck of just simply living in the same house where he and his mutant robot son pino get it used to the worst hopefully the last in this semi series this one and the previous one look like soft core porn movies but without the sex and nudity kind of like a low rent hybrid of halloween iii puppet master dolls and bad home movies supposedly in they started to do a sixth chapter in the series but it was abandoned and never completed we can all only hope that it stays that a star out of
once again a film classic has been pointlessly remade with predictably disastrous results the title is false as is everything about this film the period is not persuasively rendered and the leads seem way too young and too vapid to even be criminals arthur film had style humor a point of view and was made by talented people even if the version didn't exist this would still be an unnecessary film the version strayed from the facts presented a glamorized version of bonnie and clyde but it was exciting and innovative for and it had some outstanding performances that allowed you to care this remake seems culled from the original film rather than the truth as known and the actors in this version are callow unappealing and not the least bit interesting by all means skip this one and hope the version will be better could it possibly be worse
this sports a nice deep cast but for a thriller you better deliver more than name actors and talk the first third of this movie was nothing but talk and more talk most of that was a bunch of women bitching about everything to each other first five listed actors in here are women so that verifies that really a chick flick and little else this probably plays on the lifetime was a quick murder scene and then more talk by halfway through they had lost me the way sally field looked about years old in here
a young boy comes into a lot of money and promptly begins to live it up unfortunately the man whose money it really is happens to be very bad he wants his loot back when he discovers who has the bucks he begins trying to get it back he keeps getting foiled by this little kid who is just lucky enough to keep from falling into the evil hands sounds familiar i'll bet very predictable not interesting at all come up with something a bit different ok guys
the cover on the dvd and disc is freaking awesome you would think they made a movie about sweet tooth from twisted metal black which is still a really great idea but this actors are worst then performance in pearl harbor have better quality and better actors i was gonna buy the dvd but luckily i rented it first the plot and script are also horrible nothing seems to go to together so the movie really never makes sense the poor attempts to frighten you using flashback scenes are worse then ones used in sitcom shows and in the end it'll leave you wanting to bang your head against the wall of your house
one missed call another asian horror based on the cell phone i recently rented a korean horror film based on a cell phone called pon one missed call was just as boring as that one maybe phones just aren't scary or something but this move was dull and drab no tension or thrills for me and the final monster was disappointingly cheesy and unscary the movie dragged quite a bit in different parts and felt too long didn't keep my attention it seems phones are hard to make frightening kind of like trying to make a pop vending machine eerie and it is ridiculous to compare this with the ring it seems every asian horror movie is compared to it and so far i haven't seen any that measure up in the least to horror directors take the phone off the hook as a horror device
this film is one of the most dreadful things i have ever do yourselves a favor and avoid this incompetent the camera and having your actors adopt scowls does not count as direction which this film needed in droves not that the writing was all the wonderful rather we were left with a bunch of completely artificial characters directed in that most artificial way pseudo-documentary style prized by those who don't know how to film gives the impression that it was done cynically to appeal to critics who don't know the first thing about film-making is most of terrible it says a lot about sundance and what become that victor vargas was showcased there
well its official they have just killed american pie the first were absolutely hysterical but this one and the others have been awful i mean the story is about two college who battle each other for its houses i mean come on talk about a weak plot the first three dealt with growing up change and marriage which are all worthy points of development in human new stifler is the biggest joke i know its hard trying to compare yourself with the steven stifler but so no cigar i give this movie a because there is funny bits in the best character in this movie of course is dad i don't know why he keeps continuing to do these poorly developed films
what this movie fails from answering is how wrong this war is most us wars recently made only to get some many innocent civilian casualties there has been how many lives perished and how blatantly stupid the perpetrators let me ask you if american soldier kills women and children apart from enemy its ok but if government accidentally kills their own forces by deadly chemicals while killing many civilians as well it is not your logic fails give it for the solid performance and to everything else in total
i'll start with what i really liked the songs everything about them was great the costumes music lyrics long as the translation was good choreography loved the crab scene and the cooking about get it arty cinema blablabla but too much is too much too much silence was interesting for an hour but two hours of hearing steps and moaning from time to time really too much boredom movie should ever be boring no matter how deep it was to be too much porn-like scenes do get it really i get that they were filming a porn movie there but really really really that is too much i truly think that cinema should be for watching and this one is definitely not watchable in no stars for the songs
this was not a well done western you've got this nut riding around in the blazing sun in a buggy with a parasol over it killing people for his own reasons you've got this same person sitting in a snow cave during a blizzard cutting off pieces of his anatomy which have been frostbitten then you've got some woman in a house out in the middle of somewhere shooting wolves that are not there what is the point of this film couldn't bruce dern find something better to do this was a waste of film
triumph of love is proof that not every com√©die-fran√ßaise author who uses cross-dressing disguised courtship like shakespeare is worth seeing maybe something was lost in the translation of this adaptation of marivaux a commedia dell arte-inspired playwright of whom brittannica says his nuanced feeling and clever wordplay became known as marivaudage mira sorvino has fun dangling three mixed-up romances her pants role wasn't even up to cherubino in marriage of herky-jerky editing is annoying and just seems to indicate that a lot of takes were needed for each long was fiona shaw as the fooled spinster as well as the glimpses of audience we see and the closing curtain call to wink that this is all artifice doesn't really written
you already know how painful to watch this movie is but i wonder why one of the worst movies ever should include one the most beautiful cars why the cars should be not only the victim of violation but also the only true actors and performers in it so how on earth you porsche lamborghini or whatever could allow those people to get in touch with your cars and ruin you reputation for which you give the getting an advantage of the cars and earn money on their chests it is painful for those who love cars it is painful for those who love want my money back
as others have noted this movie is criminally inaccurate in its portrayal of the life and i for one was very annoyed and offended by its transformation of her rape into a tragic love affair by the implication that her rapist was responsible for awakening her talent by its complete disregard for her work by the way it turned her into a sex object on and on you get the idea also i find it disturbing that people who aren't familiar with gentileschi will see this film and walk away with that kind of impression of her
the plot of this film is not strong at all lots of holes if you approach it as a car movie its not bad lots of great cars in this one the reason i like it is because i am from the area where this was filmed i get the most enjoyment looking at the recognizable places in st cloud mn and seeing how the town has changed since its an interesting historical piece for us locals seems like whenever a film is made here everyone wants some relationship to it it is impossible to find a copy in any of the local video stores as they were all stolen once it came out on vhs had to get a copy from japan on ebay i find it interesting how the path of the drag race is all over town i didn't know the director was from
richard tyler is a little boy who is scared of everything he doesn't like riding his bike or climbing on his tree house because he knows what kind of accidents might happen to him so one day he is riding his bike and because it is starting to rain he decides to wait in the library until it stops raining in there the whole story takes place he experiences all kinds of staff and in the end he is not scared any more but the whole story is unbelievable and even good actors like macaulay culkin could not make the story better than it is
because that is the only way you won't think this film is a total waste of time and money a remake of heaven can wait was at least worth watching is a poor excuse for a romantic comedy it is more a vehicle to give rock some time on film for weak stand up comedy which doesn't play well on the big screen especially because his jokes generally are supposed to be from the body of an old fat rich dead man but are shown coming from rock himself as he insults blacks and whites the chemistry is all wrong the movie is not funny poorly shot the acting is weak at best go rent heaven can wait and a live rock video and you'll be way ahead of the game
welcome to a bad ghost story and nightmare this horror tale finds a newly married by the memory of his previous wife and screaming skulls found throughout their empty mansion and lily pond is the husband really trying to drive his already anxious bride insane or is it the learning challenged gardener has taken care of the grounds since the death of the original mistress of the house this low budget horror flick has a story line that keeps you involved all the way the finale special effects are pretty bad even at standards i swear at times the screaming skull sounds much like it should be in a godzilla movie also in the cast as reverend snow is character actor russ conway by the lurking the director you can catch this as part of monsterfest
probably new zealands worst movie ever jokes they are not funny used from other movies just plain corny the acting is bad even though there is a great story is uninteresting boring has more cheese then pizza huts cheese lovers pizza kind of like the acting has been do times watched this when it came on tv but was so boring could only stand minutes of it movie not watch it paint dry instead
i was forced to watch this whole series of films as a young child and i was told they were real talk about child abuse i would have been less frightened of dracula or frankenstein this series is only good for people who believe in this ridiculousness and who want to indoctrinate their children into believing the same besides the obvious issues associated with brainwashing and indoctrination also the bad acting bad writing and bad special effects they are just all around terrible terrible movies yes believable horrifying to a kid but i can't imagine a grown-up buying into this shlock although i must say that i would be interested in seeing them today as an adult they might have a certain movie feel to them
this movie could have been very good but comes up way short cheesy special effects and so-so acting i could have looked past that if the story wasn't so lousy if there was more of a background story it would have been better the plot centers around an evil druid witch who is linked to this woman who gets migraines the movie drags on and on and never clearly explains anything it just keeps plodding on christopher walken has a part but it is completely senseless as is most of the movie this movie had potential but it looks like some really bad made for tv movie i would avoid this movie
i think that most everyone wants to believe that extraordinary things exist and this film shows no restraint in trying to exploit that to the fullest the presentation is very interesting well presented and the graphics are state of the art but from a scientific point of view it just doesn't work hydrogen filled flying bladders they would need to be the size of a mack truck to be useful and then the ever-present possibility of a catastrophic explosion i have no problem with fantasy just don't try to pass it off as fact some folks will always misunderstand all in all the film is entertaining but i constantly found myself saying oh brother what a load of if you want a fake documentary watch this is spinal tap instead or at the very least turn the sound off
a very good story for a film which if done properly would be quite interesting but where the hell is the ending to this fact what is the point of scenes zip through so quick that you felt you were not part of the film emotionally and the feeling of being detached from understanding the performances of the cast are questionable if not i miss the conclusion somewhere in the film i guess we have to wait for the
i am very surprised by the positive comments because there were four of us that saw this at one screening and we all walked out we personally felt that it was painfully slow to watch and couldn't sit through the whole movie and we really tried to stick with it in particular those in the group who really wanted to like it because of their personal experiences with sexual orientation alienation in the school years depicted didn't like or identify with it at all said it is great to see that this film really resonated with a lot of people here on the boards and with reviewers the beauty of the subjective art form of film
black and white film good photography believable characters have wasted another perfect evening watching a film that other rated as worthy and very good there is some good acting here and the back ground setting for the plot is good should have been done with this but it is very slow to grow and never develops it is totally bases on sex without much romance with much un needed nudity more could have been done with the main characters if you are looking for something to watch with you family this in not the movie and if not you will have trouble sitting through it though this film is long its only about inch deep
wow i payed to go see this movie at the cinema cant believe i wasted my time the acting is cringe worthy at best and the special effects are crude probarly the worst script in history some extremely embarrassing quotes i have ever heard in my life i swear to god swept away is better than this madonna should of won and oscar compared to these guys an hour and a half of my life i want back honestly people don't see this even toddler would find this movie an insult to their intelligence i found this movie very strange in the fact that it was hard to tell who is more wooden theses guys here of the actual puppets pleas guys don't waste your time on this movie you will live to regret it
i rented this thinking it might be interesting and it might have been an interesting story except that is was told in such an uninteresting manner hard to follow strange editing disjointed storyline the characters mumble all in all a dreadfully dull waste of time i just couldn't get into it and didn't care what happened to the characters not even ian holm could save this film unless you need a cure for insomnia i'd skip it and being generous
i also having endured hundreds of movies in the past consider this to be one of the worst i have ever i resent in this day and age having to explain to my children that russia is not the bad guys also that mocking russian names like poopchev is the grandfather birthday party scene contained a quasi-sexist joke in which he implied that males drink beer and women talk on the phone two other flies also needlessly use the word crap the whole movie largely smacks of stereotypes and propaganda that i thought we as a nation were proud to have risen all just crude badly animated even more badly written and not worth wasting the time to view
this a fascinatingly awful movie it make so little sense that it starts to make a kind of weird internal logic of its own well it would if it didn't keep darting off up side-alleys until eventually floundering under the weight of its own indecisiveness the movie can't make up its mind whether it is a straight forward man turns into monster flick all those the incredible insert verb ing man movies or a ghastly big business conspiracy theory movie or a mystical afterlife contact story or or what take your pick just a mess grotesquely over the top and firing off in all directions leaving loose ends flapping all over the place it was as if tobe hooper had been taking david lynch pills unfortunately he didn't take enough
ostensibly this is a z-grade dtv horror with lines like easy to die i have many are you reading that book because it makes the plot more made your way in here now you can make your way out again he leads a man into the take a listen to what they not that clear what this film made in the era known for post-structuralism is actually about or whether its just bad film-making the acting is atrocious but some actors i know so are they hamming it up old house cut obviously with a contemporary dwelling is the site of murders a film is made in the grounds and the story replays again
although this film was made before dogme emerged as the predominant method of filmmaking and before digital triumphed over strike that you get the point this masterpiece clearly anticipated those developments corin nemec is just outstanding as the ne'er do well author and narrator the pace is slow but elegantly so because the cinematography is so beautiful record it the next time its on because i guarantee you'll never see a better nostalgia rip-off movie direct-to-video never felt so good
wow what a great cast julia roberts john cusack christopher walken catherine zeta-jones hank that a script you say now you're just being greedy surely such a charismatic bunch of thespians will weave such fetching tapestries of cinematic wonder that a script will be unnecessary you'd think so but no sweethearts is one missed opportunity after another like everyone involved woke up before each and though you know what i've been working pretty hard lately and this is guaranteed to be a hit with all these big names right i'm just gonna cruise along and let somebody else carry the can so much potential yet so painful to sit through there isn't a single aspect of this thing that doesn't suck even fat suit is lame
i agree with most of the other guys a waste of photons and valuable no joke is worth the paper is was written on the only highlight from my pov is olli dittrich as pinocchio ich muss eh waldsterben this reminds of old times with rtl samstag nacht it is hard to describe the performances of the actors since most of them don't even seem to have a good time during production and just do their thing camera is ok plot is laughable i think you would be ashamed even if you discuss this with lots of from this i yawned all the time wondered about how a script like this could even be considered for production and waited for the year old son was pleased but then he is pleased by so little at this age a point rating here nearly is point too much
this film has an interesting plot but the acting is quite bad and the script is poor i was very disappointed the moral dilemma faced by the main character is an intriguing one but due to poor writing and casting this potentially winning premise is plundered of the other people in the theater left after about minutes and the other were laughing at how bad the film was i stuck it out to the end but i must admit i played blackjack on my cell phone to make the last minutes bearable
i've seen a lot of stupid plotlines in my time but this one is among the worst after catching some disease in space an astronaut comes back to earth and starts melting he then goes on a rampage killing people is beyond me i just watch them i can't explain them this is the kind of movie that shouldn't have been made in the first place
to make any film about the supposed end of the world there should be some facts realism we are never told why these people believe this is new years eve in toronto canada so please some one tell me why was then still shining at midnight on the costumes did it seem like the acting was in that neo-au-natural style that needed a director who knew how to do the individual story pieces were all dreary without any purpose i could go on but i do not want to make this as boring as the rating of on imdb you i am as jay harris
the most embarrassing moment in this film is when brady corbet says you've blossomed near the end the film i practically died i'm still not really sure why the screenwriters put that line in there was it supposed to create romance because it nearly made me sick rest of the script was almost as never liked the original thunderbirds but a thunderbirds movie had the potential to do so much this movie doesn't if it didn't have the big draw card of the thunderbirds brand it would have been shafted straight to tv or canned in the post-production maybe even before i said the best thing about the movie is when the credits roll up and they play song thunderbirds are go i can't believe i wasted watching this through pay-per-view
this movie is traditional bollywood fare as far as the star power sentimentality and love triangle of emotions what really bothered me about this movie was the makers absurd notion of surrogate mother a whore who conceives a child with someone after have sex with the man the family desiring a child is not a surrogate mother neither is she a good candidate for a surrogate mother i have seen indian movies and television shows that made to years ago that dealt with this issue more intelligently the whole concept of the movie is ridiculous and absolutely implausible i realize that most bollywood movies aren't meant to be plausible but they don't pretend to be either this movie wants us to emote along with the characters but this can't done with such a ridiculous contrived conflict i would have expected better from abbas and mustan
me my boyfriend and our friend watched this movie if thats what u wanna call it and we agree with the last person but we were stupid and bought the damn thing we thought it really was about diablo so we bought hate it really suxz so beware do not buy this thing they call a would return it but don't no if anybody would want this stupid and another thing the shouldn't call it the legend of diablo they should of called it legend of this movie is rated r this should not of even been not think that diablo would be crying his eyes out laughing at this stupid is a movie that would have been done by a actors are never gonna become nothing because this movie
dolph lundgren broods and scowls his way through this incoherent not nearly as cool as the box would have you believe he is actually quite good here but the story is a mess of b-movie cliches revenge tycoons hookers that looks like it was made up as they went along the film picks up a bit in the second half but for a more decent lundgren flick rent red scorpion instead
i actually have a fondness for christopher lee but this just wasn't up to his other performances and he was one of the better film does not live up to its premise not that scary overly melodramatic and it draaaaaags every time i thought oh here comes the good part the good part never quite evil ones aren't at all convincing most of the other characters were also lacking in if i'd been in the proper frame of mind i might have enjoyed some mstie-fication at this expense but naaahhh didn't really seem to be worth the effort it wasn't really very good it wasn't really very bad it was just mediocre
what ever possessed martin scorcese to remake this film and not only did he remake it completely ruin it the nonsensical decision to make the character played by robert deniro his most overdone performance and saying a lot into a religious fanatic is ridiculous and exemplary of attitudes harbored by hollywood mr scorcese attitudes that compel writers to think that the best way to make a character insane is to tattoo a crucifix on his back in any case this movie is awful
saw this film recently and have to say it was the worst attempt at film making i have ever had the misfortune to see what the hell was going on with coolio totally unprovoked shooting at people in distress totally uninvolving slow tedious and detached worse than spawn long live evil dead ii
every generation fully believes it is living in the end times this has been true for thousands of years now and movies like this feed on this how did they get the great orson welles to narrate this train wreck this is a documentary about the biblical prophecies of armageddon it tries to link the prophecies as well as it can to what was happening in the times it was made making it obviously dated and kind of reenactments look like they are out of unsolved mysteries but without the high production values people should have been embarrassed to take part in short the movie is dated silly reactionary and useless good if you want a good laugh but not good enough to actually look for
i am watching this movie right now on wtn because that was the channel that the tv was turned to when i turned it on it is a not very credible and fairly boring story about a wife paul falling in lust with a young washboard abs played by corey sevier there may or may not be a plot corey whips his shirt off a lot and alexandra swoons i'm getting the feeling supposed to be up to no good and why messing with skinny alexandra paul not really important because as i said he takes his shirt off a lot and i just caught a glimpse of butt cleavage a lot of sax on the soundtrack which is just painful
in this extremely low-budget i've seen home movies made with better production value australian utter rip-off of the burning friday the a band is planning to make a music video while on a houseboat they're stalked by a serial killer who was burned years before this movie is even proclaimed to be the worst australian film ever made in dvd promotional material only selling point complete and utter rubbish in every considerable way perhaps a few chuckles here and there for bad movie lovers but it still made me want to burn out my candy a quick flash of barely existent itty bitty titties in a lame shower grade f
advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this i haven't seen them hamiltons sure did deliver one lowsy piece of it did not entertain me at thought that in common with the semi-bad plot the twist at the end of the was very movie supposively these are people who eat other i said people not because they aren't wait i think they no didn't tell these people are they what are they're just things that came here to see what people taste like they cannibals who have eaten people for a long time maybe this movie was it if you think the hamiltons is ask of was it so to me it was just flat out big booooooo for the see the borderland for a piece of entertainment
loonatics unleashed is the worst thing that could happen to the classic characters created by chuck jones the loony tunes have many spin and different versions some were good others not very much but loonatics the worst the concept is stupid and derivative of shows as the power rangers and teen titans there wasn't any similarity with the original characters and the stories are boring and poorly made the new designs are ugly and the animation is pathetic this show just doesn't work this horrible waste of animation is a complete failure and this shouldn't have be nothing more than a bad joke lame zero stars
how many more of those fake slice of life movies need to be made hopefully not too victor vargas is a very self-conscious attempt by the director peter solett at garnering the attention of hollywood nothing wrong with that in general what is wrong with this film in particular is that it ignores the audience and piles on every clich√© in the book of supposedly edgy hollywood independent supposed to be real so left shake the camera documentary style except no documentarian would shake the camera on edgy so not waste any time lighting the hip so have the children use swear words like al pacino in so on and so forth all that you are left with is a very self-conscious attempt at impressing hollywood that won't impress anyone outside of the rarefied indie crowd that seems to still heap acclaim on every bad film
a study in bad bad acting bad music bad screenplay bad editing bad direction and a bad idea pieces of schlock don't come any cheesier or unintentionally funnier than this thing by the end of the movie you are left wondering why did they bother in the first place poor malcolm mcdowell was he short of cash or something still thinking of seeing this if you haven't died of laughter in the first thirty minutes by the time you'll see the cyborg-populated town named cytown you will avoid this my movie-loving friends avoid
first of all jenna jameson is the best actress in this movie and just awful this movie has every horror move clich√© in imagination and all badly played the over-sexed teen couple the jock the snotty cool chick the creepy local color guy the parental-type couple the virginal chick who amazingly never dies in these films the dialogue is so painfully awful and delivered with the depth of a wading pool almost like you're wishing that they'd all die sooner i saw the rough cut of this film a while ago but somehow this just got worse sure the funniest thing in here is the ghoul trying to eat implants but that hardly rates even a rental of this dog avoid at all costs
i loved the first two movies but this movie was just a waste of time and money me and the studio i'm still wondering why they made this horrible movie the thing with the plastic gun and with the toy car that can go into another house are ridiculous joe pesci and daniel stern in the first two movies were so funny but the terrorists in this one are so stupid and not funny believe me this movie is just a waste of time
while i count myself as a fan of the babylon television series the original movie that introduced the series was a weak start although many of the elements that would later mature and become much more compelling in the series are there the pace of the gathering is slow the makeup somewhat inadequate and the plot confusing worse the characterization in the premiere episode is poor although the ratings chart shows that many fans are willing to overlook these problems i remember the gathering almost turned me off off what soon grew into a spectacular series
this is yet another depressing and boring film about aids and tragedy it begins very uneventful and predictable and continues throughout the movie i kept waiting for it to pick-up but unfortunately it never did the acting is fair but the script needs a lot of work and if you're looking for the nudity don't waste your time with these not so hot actors due to the poor sound quality and lack of captions i missed of the movie if you have never seen over five gay films or have recently come to terms with being gay you may find this film interesting otherwise your run-of-the-mill low budget movie it ranks as one of the worst gay films i have ever seen
a low budget effort from texas at least filmed well but that is little consolation bad acting or should i say bad over-acting a pretty limp story line nothing new bad special effects bad bad bad seems like a bunch of young folks are putting together a haunted house for halloween which is done every year but this year things are different has a long extended lesbian theme that is not only annoying but definitely fills out the empty spots of which there are a lot putrid puerile definitely avoidable at all costs
antitrust could have been a great vehicle for rachael leigh cook but the director cut out her best scenes in the scenes that she are in she is just a zombie she is involved in a sub-plot that is simular to a sub-plot in get carter but she handles the sub-plot better in get blame the director the homage to hitchcock was corny the scene were ryan charactor realizes he may not be able to trust tim charactor at least i think a homage to hitchcock the dvd shows the scenes that were cut out i think the director should have trust his instincts and not listen to the test audiences
i saw this for gary busey and fred williamson thinking they were buddy cops they are but busey is in the opening scene then doesn't show up again until like minutes into the movie though every scene in is awesome especially when he disguises himself as a blind incredible about this movie is the plot in the movie fred williamson is trying to find out who stalking and killing phone sex operators at one point i think thats its busey but it turns out i'm only partly right busey is not the killer but he is calling up and harassing the women over the phone why i don't know in no way is he connected to the killer he just does it for kicks i guess
this is not a good movie too preachy in parts and the story line was sub par the was ok but not superb i almost fell asleep in this story is about young flies that want to have adventure and follow up on it the characters are lacking i truly do not care about these characters and feel that there was nothing to keep an adult interested pixar this is would have liked to see more special effects also i wold like to see more fly jokes than the mom constantly saying lord of the flies pretty sexist in showing the women as house wives and fainting
wow this movie sucked big time i heard this movie expresses the meaning of friendship very well and with all the internet hype on this movie i figured what could go wrong however the movie was just plain bad it was boring and the character development was never there space travelers was also a horrible movie if you didn't like that movie there is no way you will like this
not the sound of bees the effect induced by watching this extremely long extremely boring badly acted movie how i ever made it through all hours without falling asleep i'll never know the plot is thoroughly unlikable morons talk about sex for hours and you thought rohmer was deadly this is even worse if possible i must really be a masochist if i could watch this entire movie without turning it killing someone
i saw this movie two weeks ago at the festival des nouvelles images du japon in paris though i wasn't expecting much from it i have to say i've been disappointed just like many people in the audience if i wanted to sum up how i felt i'd say i've been comparing it to princess mononoke and nausicaa from the beginning to the end of course silly but i couldn't help it the stories are quite different but the worlds pictured are very much alike and from this point of view a tree of palme definitely can't stand the comparison with masterworks even if quite good technically boredom remains in the end its complete lack of originality makes me advise you not to care to watch it i rated it out of bit harsh i guess it deserves or
when i go to see movies i would stay up and watch it or if i did not like it i would go sleep but this was pure crap i actually got up and walked was poorly script and put together i hated it also they should not have taken brendan frasier off he was much better this was not as good as i had expected considering that i really liked george of the jungle and the graphics weren't as good as the first one for instance the bird and when ever he crashed in a tree i hope that the director of this takes heed and next movies he make he needs to i really would like to give ursla a job well done as she made the movie worthwhile i walked i give this movie a out of
a demented scientist girlfriend is decapitated so he brings her head back to life honest this is the plot of the movie he to get her another body he searches through the sleaze area of town for that perfect body for some reason he has ugly looking monster in a closet at his cabin the sleaze style of the movie is laughable no one in the movie can actually act including the head the closet monster is a man with a mask tie on and you can really tell the plot is slow weak and the ending is so badly done watch the mystery science theater version of this move believe me folks i wouldn't watch this movie on its own
the radar men from the moon is a pretty typical fare of serials the special effects are pretty cheap the lunar rovers are obviously world war ii surplus jeeps with painted plywood over them and the like the acting is only so-so it does inspire the imagination of children to whom i believe this was directed to by standards boring cheap and bad also a hefty amount of stock footage in the first episodes of natural disasters
how does a scotsman in a kilt make love in the bonny purple heather i have the distinct advantage over many other of the reviewers in that i was born in too many americans take this simplistic nonsense a legs good two legs orwell had it jessica lange has an accent that the wells next the sea amateur dramatic production of brigadoon would turn down liam neeson apparently popular with the ladies wears his kilt with all the authority of a man whose great grandmama once stepped off the train at edinburgh waverley and the auld would the scots be without them to hate and blame for and hurt should be ashamed for indulging in such racist stereotyping robin hood prince of thieves seems a masterpiece of historical accuracy in at least alan rickman was funny
i expect the same excitement as i spit on your grave but i was let down by just junk how can you even call this a movie its kinda of a mini porno it made my sick when the guy was made to eat his own business there is no story line to it at all it jumps to quickly from each murder if you like seeing a women naked or even mens parts then spots in the movie for and even a masturbation spot in the movie which makes it a porno and not a movie at all i have seen some dumb movies in my time but this is number i want be watching it again at all the actors even look bored during the movie to me so they probably were in need of money badly to make this movie
pet sematary though a nice horror movie with a nice director and atmosphere is a copy of the italian movie zeder by pupi avati clear that stephen king has copied almost all the ideas from this director movie zeder was made before king wrote the cat the ground everything was copied this is a case of plagiary but being stephen kind a famous american writer totally normal that he can get away with this obviously due to the huge difference between this kind of italians movies with no in part crap itself but the original idea i repeat it italian director the world know
i watched this movie also and altho it is very well done i found it a heartbreaker and would not recommend this to women who have small children the terror on this face when she sees her child about to be run over by a train is truly heartbreaking and the sad thing she dies eventually she goes back to the applacian mountains all the money in the world which she makes from making dolls does not conceal the grief she has i remember her desperate face as she pulls money out of her clothes to try to have her child healed i'm surprised this movie takes place in detroit because when i watched it i thought for sure the people had come to cincinnati ohio this also was a route for the poor from the mountains
the trailers get you to the movie but the movie just wasn't worth my it has some good effects but the storyline yech i like tommy lee jones and will smith as actors they have both done some good films but i wish they hadn't added this one to their to be honest the book is better
oh man i know what your thinking with a title like that i can't go wrong uh yes you can i too loved the title but man i hated the stupid kid that played little helper i hated the mom too and the and her boyfriend i hated all those people man it was agony watching this sometimes the only reason this doesn't get is becuz condsidering the low budget they did ok but oh man did i hate those actors so stupid i knew it was going to be bad i guess they saved a lot of money on just using halloween masks for the killer and the jesus costume at the end was really stupid too oh the agony do not watch
this was a strange kind of film about a low-lifes in new york city and centering around a main character title name played by brad pitt who thinks a ricky nelson-type musician except he has no real talent kind of fun to watch until a profane tough new york city-type woman with horrible accent enters the picture and takes over that ruined the film for me it must have been catherine keener who usually plays tough and garbage-mouthed women hairdo on pitt an exaggerated pompadour was fun to look at i can picture johnny depp playing this role better one last note it odd to hear a film made in than woody with just mono sound
the supernatural vengeful police officer is back for a third installment this time acting as guardian angel for a wrongfully accused female cop standard stalk and slash picture yet well acted and directed thus making it oddly interesting and watchable though the violence isn't for the squeamish the cut which was originally given an out of
though the title may suggest examples of the commandments it is a definitely incorrect assumption this is an adaptation of seemingly unrelated stories from giovanni century decameron story within a medieval italian largely peasant population it is a diatribe on the reality of sex its consequences within that world and time a realistic view of life within this world it sometimes feels like a journey back in the depicted human element of its time one can also see the more adventurous side of morality in its protagonists as well as the ironies of life at times or it may also be viewed as a general satire of the catholic terribly special but definitely interesting if one comes with no expectations or assumptions
i saw this film under the title of tied up in general i have enjoyed movies so gave this one a try it wasn't worth it i have read some of the previous comments about the box enticing viewers don't be fooled this is a poor film at best the acting is nonexistent the plot what little there is of one is very predictable the movie in places seems to be chopped together this one just plain stinks the place up not even worth the price of a cheap night rental as a bit of a dolph fan i kept waiting to see him in action by the end of the movie you will still be waiting best to avoid this film and spend your time watching almost anything else
it is one of the worst movies i've ever seen but hostel is definitely much more worse this movie is more funny and ridiculous than scary i laughed most of the time when watched it low quality effects you gonna watch it you'll understand what i'm talking about and how low quality is that bad actors hear of them for the first time and it seems like shot by an amateur camcorder it looks more like a tv show than a movie but at least i've had the patience to watch it till the end like comedies watch it wanna horror go watch ju-on the grudge or some other good horror i'm talking about the legend of diablo i don't even know if i can classify it to a horror genre just some low-budget rate it out of
cornel wilde and three dumbbells search for sunken treasure in the south treasure-hunters led by wilde fight a group of territorial sharks with cute little sneers on their hungry faces wilde and his merry men must find a way to take themselves off the menu so they can begin excavating an old spanish galleon filled with gold the crew engages in a small eternity of pushing shoving arguing and listening to annoying health tips crazy convicts board the boat and complicate things now it is a battle of wits as to who gets the treasure and who gets to see what the inside of a stomach looks least wilde is in shape wearing exactly the same thing he wore in the naked prey years earlier and he has remained in excellent on a budget of cents
for this list of good points and bad start with the casting burt reynolds as boss acting of said badly chosen idea of setting the film in the modern above whole idea of making a feature film out of a television series that wasn't that great to start simpson in a red might make an analogy the scene where jessica simpson as daisy duke struts her way up to michael weston as asks the boss hogg and his clouded judgment tells her where they might just as well have this a good red bikini would have clouded his judgment into saying though in his right mind he would have not good as she looked in the could have been stark even that would not have saved this horrible piece of out of hazzard
one line that makes it worth to rent for angel fans everyone else this is just a very bad horror flick the female characters are typical horror movies females they are wooden annoying and dumb you are glad when they are killed off long live the strong female character in a horror movie
this film has so little class in comparison to strangers on a train or even accidental meeting for that matter that despite plot similarities i wouldn't feel right in actually comparing this to either of them the yancy butler character came across as such a dopey dimwit i was too embarrassed for the writer and director to continue don't enjoy many lifetime movies but feel compelled to watch one every now and then in the interest of promoting harmony at home i often groan silently but this film caused me to protest out loud stand up leave the room and walk around the house mumbling to myself before i returned to my normally favorite chair to subject myself to more morgan rochester ny
if only to avoid making this type of film in the future this film is interesting as an experiment but tells no cogent might feel virtuous for sitting thru it because it touches on so many important issues but it does so without any discernable motive the viewer comes away with no new perspectives one comes up with one while mind wanders as it will invariably do during this pointless might better spend time staring out a window at a tree
this film is terrible the characters are completely unbelievable and wildly inconsistent the plot is awful and some of the classroom scenes are cringe-worthy and make for uncomfortable fact the quality of the script and characterisation would suggest that this film was written by high school students only the utter lack of credibility to the school environment would suggest that in fact the writers probably never went to high school the acting in most cases was weak too although a lot of this was down to a poor script and plot i am not sure that any actors could have made this film said that the sound track was ok and the cinematography was nice in places the editing was poor
this movie is truly one of the worst pieces of garbage ever it really is surprising that something so completely terrible could be made but if you can stand the mind-numbing plot character development and direction you may get a kick out of the soundtrack which is so appalling that it is funny the movie begins terribly and quickly becomes unwatchable someone should give anyone involved with this movie some sort of consolation because their career was probably ruined because of involvement in this movie if you do end up seeing this movie or have seen it already feel your pain then these words have come too late for anyone else stay away at all costs or realize that the movie is so bad that it will waste hours of your life then at least you can clean up or something while viewing it
umm i was quite surprised that someone actually gave this film high face it tori spelling is not a great actress and this movie just proves the extent of her talent the plot was weak i bet the dork that came up with this concept was some perverted peeping tom if there is a good thing about this movie i would say that tommy daughter just for the fact that his daughter and then there is that soap-opera-ish male lead decent good looks somewhat make him attractive but ceases to help his dramatic abilities does imdb require at least lines how many more ways can you simply say this movie sucks
the only aspect of this film that saves it from being my least favorite piece of celluloid trash is a single line uttered by an agent attempting to infiltrate the man-eating tomatoes by dressing in a tomato costume can somebody please pass the ketchup i highly urge anyone with a sleeping disorder to use this film as a sedative it works better than an overdose of demarol
sondra locke stinks in this film but then she was an awful actress anyway unfortunately she drags everyone else then life boyfriend clint eastwood down the drain with her but what was clint eastwood thinking when he agreed to star in this one one read of the script should have told him that this one was going to be a real snorer an exceptionally weak story basically no story or plot at all add in bored poor acting even from the normally good eastwood absolutely no action except a couple arguments and as far as i was concerned this film ranks up at the top of the heap of natural sleep enhancers wow could a film be any more boring i think watching paint dry or the grass grow might be more fun a real stinker don't bother with this one
what a bad bad film i can't believe all the hype that has been lavished on this pretentious amateurish excuse for a real movie i left the theater before the end stunned by how bad the direction and camera-work of that movie were and to read adoring paeans that claim there is truth and reality in this film when all it is in reality is a brazen attempt at pulling the wool over the eyes of reviewers and festivals by being cheap and least this film showed me once and for all that the sundance festival has become a complete joke and that being shown here is more a label of bad film-making than anything at all costs you'll want your time back i know i did
if you have ever seen a movie by brian avenet-bradley and compares it to the feedbacks it gets on imdb you know that most of the comments and votes are faked trust me you will be bored people of the production team write their feedback themselves they even admit it but not enough they also click constantly no whenever there is a negative comment on the movie why negative critics are always placed behind the hyped movie itself is bad bad bad bad acting bad lighting bad script bad ending believe me now if not you will believe me avenet-bradley might be quite a good business man otherwise it cannot be explained that he finds people who still finance his movies they are cheap but nevertheless but as a creative person he is a complete failure
this movie is a terrible waste of time although it is only an hour and a half long it feels somewhere close to i have never seen a movie move so slowly and so without a purpose this is also a horror film that takes place a lot of the time during daylight my friend and i laughed an insane amount of times when we were probably supposed to be only thing we want to know is why such a terrible movie was released in so many countries it cannot be that high in demand supermodel nicole petty should stick to modeling because although she is beautiful she lost her accent so many times in this movie half of the time she is british and half the time she is american
this is about the worst movie i have ever seen this movie does match the quality of such movies as they cabin fever but even those had name actors where this one fell short the eye candy of this movie looked to be a woman with a bad face lift an example of the quality i would have rated this movie in the negative if possible ladies i have to tell you that the men were not bad to look at but not much either if you were planning on going to see this movie i would strongly recommend saving your money
guy noble effort is beat up knocked down raped kicked around shot stabbed spit upon punched sodomized and abused and left for dead by dreadful performance her acting was very reminiscent of a graduate from the al gore school of dramatics and public speaking guy ritchie did do a somewhat noble attempt to remake this and if you exclude all of the scenes that his wife was in a fair movie at best i think that the best acting job ever had to be guy comforting his wife that her performance was good enough not to re-shoot if you have an opportunity of watching swept away or clipping your toenails for for the extended pedicure
while exploring some caves with his wife a doctor is bitten by a bat which causes some alarming side creepy atmosphere and some decent under used makeup effects don't save this b horror flick from being a sub-par tale of man-becomes-creature the bat people aka it lives by night suffers from its senseless story awkwardly plotted and lackluster in pacing the plot never seems to go anywhere much and the movie never offers an explanation for what happens or even a satisfying conclusion for it all the cast is fairly mediocre in their i give the film some points for its haunting theme song and nice filming locations the makeup work of the late stan winston is pretty good too but it doesn't get much of a showcase here a missed opportunity for sure one of the lesser man-creature flicks out out of
the mood of this movie is pretty good and it captures the feel of the well with some good script is run of the mill with the exception of a couple of comedic moments and comes off as being weird where i expect it was intended to be edgy the characters are totally over dramatized and unbelievable and full of right wing clich√©s that the script writer probably saw watching a panorama documentary on the national front the biggest problem is this movie has no real story it ticks all the right arty boxes but nothing actually happens and at the end you are left wondering what the point disappointing
a film so insecure the creaters perhaps hoped to milk an original film noir classic title farewell my lovely thinking the gullible would assume it a remake the characters are so foul and unappealing that it deserved its cold reception when first released time only adds to it its absurdity having none of the guile cinematography desperation or despair of classic noir it relied instead on a convoluted and senseless crime plot that would have easily resulted in several arrests within hours as if that weren't enough it threw in an utterly sexless attempt at erotica in which at least one of the participants hadn't bothered to bathe in several days this only made this mess all the more painful to watch find a good classic forties or fifties film noir instead of wasting two hours on this failure
i wouldn't say this totally sucked but if it wasn't for netflix i wouldn't even have this in my house steve eccentric president of a chain of health food stores falls flat just not funny another in a long slew of snl rejects that can only find work whoring themselves to the next snl movie the birthing coach with the elmer fudd lisp is about as funny as it is original amy poehler simply goes through the same motions she would for a minute snl skit which is about as funny as snl lately the only thing going for this movie is that tina fey is easy on the eyes the ending was predictable as soon as you heard her character couldn't get pregnant the subject matter could have opened up to other comedic attempts but it seems to simple simmer along not really entertaining or creating laughs
how can anybody say that this movie is a comedy if i had not gone with then my finacee i would have fallen asleep and asked for my money back i love gwen paltrow but it was like she was on the wrong set i like most chick flicks but i hated this one this is the only time i saw so much clevage and was not turned on those outfits were way overdone no one talks that way anymore and i don't think they even did then the dancing part was ex said to me ya like that part didn't ya think it was sensous i said yes only to spare her feelings now i know why we never is one of the worst movies i have ever seen
this was a disappointment none of the nuance of the original the brits just seem to be able to make a truly unsettling film with none of the over-the-top histrionics of the american version the original series combined both creepy stories and subtlety of performance with great attention to lighting and settings i have watched the series many times and am still another poor adaptation along the lines of the dreadful adaptation of cracker get hooked up with bbc america or bbc canada and watch for such delights as waking the dead spooks silent witness and judge john deed watch the original touching evil then look for wire in the blood for more of the truly understated elegant performance of robson green hollywood needs to have a look at this actor
normally i dont have a problem with gratuitous swearing in films but this one really annoyed me all they did was swear for the whole film as someone else noted get cancer it was boring rambling and pretentious i wouldnt if i were you also not that i dont like films which as most people who like it will claim observe life i love eat drink man woman and all that happens in that is that a load of taiwanese people lead their lives but i could relate to them i have never met anyone who swore as much as the actors in this film and i used to work on a construction site so go figure having said that william h macy made me grin once avoid unless you enjoy tedium
definitely the worst movie i have ever seen can somebody tell me where should have i laughed not a single hint or shadow of an idea the three leading actors are pestilential especially the one think aldo from sicily who make a sicilian accent not to say about the dream-like insertion about dracula just another expedient drawn from the worst cabaret tradition to make this film last a little longer massironi and littizzetto do what they can but this so-called movie was really too too hard to rescue i would have given it but the lowest mark was and so i had to overestimate it by one mark
this movie should not classify as cinema although it is over years old now it should never ever have gotten funding and is a blight on the australian film industry which is now producing such brilliant films as the actors cannot act the music is to be blunt not music the storyline is completely nonexistent and is a struggle to sit not watch this film it is a complete waste of your time
five minutes after watching this i logged on to imdb to warn all of you out there not to bother with this movie it had moments of mild suspense and throughout the whole movie i was thinking to myself somethings gotta happen soon it did the movie ended i felt so embarrassed for the i've never been the biggest fan of patrick rea this guy just does not know how to make movies and after watching this sorry excuse of a horror flick i've gone from not been the biggest fan to will not watch another of his was taken in by the plot summary please don't make the same gave this movie a for the were not bad and it wasn't there fault they got such bad direction
i think the biggest disappointment in this film was that right until the end i expected the acting instructors of the cast to break in and apologize for how poor the acting was when you consider the powerful subject the brilliant scenery and the effort made in creating a wonderful set and spectacular images it is a shame that little attention was given to
the various nudity scenes that other reviewers referred to are poorly done and a body double was obviously used if ms pacula was reluctant to do the scenes herself perhaps she should have turned down the role the movie was not any worse than other typical canadian movies as other reviewers have pointed out canadian movies are generally poorly written and lack entertainment value which is what most movies watchers are hoping to get perhaps canadian movie producers are consciously trying to de-commercialize their movies but they have forgotten a very important thing movies by definition are a commercial thing
an absolutely atrocious adaptation of the wonderful book crude and inappropriate humor some scary parts and a sickening side story about the boyfriend wanting to send the boy away to military school to get him out of the way makes this totally inappropriate for the kids who will most likely want to see it because of the book yr olds don't waste your money your time or your good judgement
lesbian vampire film about a couple on holiday who are staying on the grounds of what they think is an empty manor house but is really being used as a pair of lesbian vampires as the vampires bring in the occasional victim the couple go about their business until the two groups come crashing looking film with two very sexy women as the vampires there is nothing beyond the eye candy that they provide to recommend this cult film yes its a sexy vampire story no it is not remotely interesting beyond the women to be honest there is a reason that i've been seeing stills of this film in horror books and magazines it looks great but other than those who want to see sexy vampires only
who actually created this piece of crap this is the worst movie i have ever seen in my life it is such a waste of time and money i hate it how they create low budget sequels featuring d-lister actors and a storyline so similar to the found this movie in the bargain bin sitting right next to wild things and death to the supermodels for what a fool i was to actually think that this could be good instead i watched in disgust as poor acting stereotypes ripped of the storyline and script from the thought that this straight-to-video production was actually even a half decent film you must be on crackd or something because i think what pretty much most of the people who've seen this film thinks what a load of crap
god i am so sick of the crap that comes out of america called anime became popular the usa animators either produce a cartoon with a style of drawing mikey or some cheep japanese animation rip-off messing up classic characters no wonder anime is beating american cartoons are not even trying anymore i just heard of this last night i live in the uk and when i found out this show first came out in i never knew the uk was so up-to-date with current shows
the premise sucked me in but it was clear about seconds in that this was either david lynch or something seriously terrible interesting to watch just to run through the fundamentalist laundry list i can be a sucker for a stirring spiritual piece comes to mind but there was nothing spiritual whatsoever about this one the message seems to be that we must all pretend we have an iq of simply get a lobotomy jennifer what happened to ya and blindly follow the bible without any sort of self-examination whatsoever or we'll trigger the second coming the kind of attitude that makes people fly jumbo jets into story buildings work around the corner from the site of the former wtc i like to think that god is a little greater than that
this film is about british prisoners of war from the world war ii escaping from a camp in find the wooden horse disappointingly boring the subject could have been thrilling suspenseful and adrenaline fuelled but the wooden horse is told in a very plain way a collection of plain and poorly told events with no suspension and thrill the first half plainly tells how the prisoners of war dug a tunnel but the events are so plain with not enough blunders and close shaves to make me on edge the latter half of the film is even worse they are just moving from one place to another without any cat and mouse chase and could the characters talk a bit less and have more action in an action film i am disappointed by the wooden horse it wasted the potential to be a great film
truly shows that hype is not everything shows by and by what a crappy actor abhishek is and is only getting movies because of his dad and his wife amitabh as always is solid ajay devgan as always is shitty and useless and the new guy is a joke the leading lady is such a waste of an actor such pathetic movie from such a revered director and from such a big industry with movies as such i have decreased the amount of bollywood movies i has been making very crappy movies for a while now time to get different actors hrithek anyone bollywood needs madhuri and kajol back every other leading lady is a half-naked wanna be pffffft
this was really a very bad movie i am a huge fan of italian horror argento mario bava fulci and yes even our good friend here lamberto sometimes comes out with a good one i found the first two demons films to be highly entertaining they were so bad they were great but this one is just so bad that it is really really bad it is intensely boring the story never goes anywhere and i hated the characters the wife slapping husband and whiny cry-baby pain in the wife drove me mad there was nowhere near enough of the story devoted to the ogre who was probably the best actor in the whole film i turned it off about three quarters of the way through because i was very very bored don't bother
really really bad how does a film this bad get made i kept waiting for some redeeming plot point interesting camera work or at least some gratuitous nudity but i got nothing i had just watched cabin fever and i thought it was an train wreck for the nudity and pancakes but it looks like genius compared to this dreck the best script doctor in the world couldn't have saved this putrid pile of of stinking only thing going for this film is that it got a headache just thinking about this movie and trying to write something ugh i'm glad i only paid for it and it will soon end up in a landfill
this is one of the worst movies i've seen in a long time not just the story but the acting is shockingly bad the dialog sounds like someone reading the is rated as not of those things a little action it really no comedy and drama at you went to the cinema to see this i feel sorry for you i would not recommend it at all pretty much anything else that you choose to look at will be better this is pretty much a movie the actions scenes sucked and crime story part of it was very you are not really interested in a good story or good acting and you simply want to look at a foreign film for the appeal of being foreign then this might be for you
this is an abysmal piece of story-telling it is about an hour into the movie before we have much idea of what it is supposed to be about the characters often mumble inaudibly actions frequently seem to have no relation to each other nobody seems to be concerned about who actually murdered the girl a pair of spooky kids go swimming in waters that seem threatening but nothing happens the irishman gets punched in the face by one of his buddies for no apparent reason to continue would be as boring as the movie itself the only half-entertaining element is the landscape photography but anyone could point a camera at the australian outback a get memorable shots overall dreary incoherent pretentious and downright annoying for wasting so much of the time
worst de niro scorsese collaboration in this horrible agonizing violent overlong mess scorsese is totally out of his element in this film with the horror cliched suddenly loud phone ringing and door slamming gimmicks that seem laughable and embarrassing coming from such a master craftsman the cast is totally wasted here and the southern accents are very annoying and forced nick noltie plays the wimpiest lawyer in history who would ever believe he can defend anyone de psychotic bowden is nothing more than the typical movie psycho killer the scene with de niro and lewis early on is very awkward and the climax goes on and on and we should all be more than tired of the on psycho stalker that never dies one of my most horrible movie experiences rent the original times better
i saw this in the market place at the cannes film festival a real cheapo prod nothing wrong with that but you have to make up for it with a bit of sex or gore or both larry cohen young is an interesting actor well done to the producers for hooking her i opening scene in the space-ship coming down is hilarious you could picture all the crew hands shaking it around ha but i wish the people who made this well at least not pretentious
the following are some of the most blaring problems with this movie clich√©s abound seriously awful twists are the narrative jumps around in time which would be fine if done well but lame characters that don't develop so much as either remain utterly static or drastically change for no good big one horrible acting over the top from nearly every following are some of the best points from the movie the lead is damn good i see it there are only two kinds of people who would be into this movie a people who can sit through minutes of tripe simply because the lead is people who often think to themselves i like hollywood dreck rife with clich√©s and overacting but if only i could watch it in korean a lot of good korean cinema out there so why waste your time with garbage
this film was slow but tedious and the acting often drifted into the land of ham character was unappealing as the something woman trying to compete with something for the love of character is beyond me the title of the movie should have been shallow people on the lake the actors played like they were in a rehearsal a dreadfully predictable ending to boot i can't believe this is on this website as a comedy
ok so i was bored and i watched it all the way film is mild inoffensive and lacklustre the story is so sugary it rots your teeth on the opening titles a tail of two traumatised children learning about god the fairy story way which frankly left me rather traumatised it uses the irish blarney in such a stereotypical way one hopes no true irish ever see it aimed at children who frankly would switch off after the first attempt at an oirish accent all in all why do they pump these out
mr perlman gives a standout performance usual sadly he has to struggle with an underwritten script and some nonsensical set is in die hard mode complete with singlet and bulging muscles i'm sure he could do better but seems satisfied to grimace and snarl through his lovely erika is very decorative though fully clothed and shows some signs of getting acting at are mainly poor cgi and steals from other shootouts are pitiful worthy of the even worth seeing for perlman avoid
this was such a waste of time danger if you watch it you will be tempted to tear your dvd out of the wall and heave it thru the amateur production terrible repetitive vacuous dialog paper-thin plot line wooden performances lucy lawless was pathetically flawed story completely unbelievable characters the two worst concepts in film and are the evil twin amnesia there are no plot twist outrageously simplistic and obvious like watching a train coming down the track in the middle of the day on the prairies it doesn't even resolve properly the evil is not punished for the original please please don't watch this even if its free and your only other choice is to go to a synagogue
let me put it another way balls or how about this is truly awful more embarrassing than those it attempts to satirise julia roberts is a skilled actress and usually her work is of the highest standard this movie is so lacking in direction even she struggles to look proficient normally she is the consummate professional yet i swear that in her eyes there were signs of bewilderment and one thing that might have rescued this move was the idea about the director walken turning the movie into a secret documentary about the actors unfortunately that theme wasn't explored to full potential too little too jones was wooden cusack was cusack and crystal should stick to acting the two talented ex-buffy stars had different experiences green hopelessly mis-cast and balfour under-used well done to julia for just about preventing this from being the worst movie ever made
only on a very rare occasion does an episode of the x-files fail to generate any excitement or does the episode contain anything which is just totally boring to detective and his former partner both die in unexplained deaths are linked to the presence of a little girl who was there when the deaths took has devised a theory that a policeman murdered by his colleagues has come back reincarnated as the little girl and is exacting for the bizarre little girl has no connection at all and seems to just a random person chosen as the think this was slightly lazy writing by the writers and this episode ranks as one of the worst in x-files history
the house of the dead was the worst movie i have ever seen between the pathetic matrix camera angle attemps and the cheesy acting i fell asleep i don't think that the director and set manager could decide whether it was raining or not because there would be rain on one side of the boat and not the other i would rate this movie a out of being the best being the worst also jumping scenes from the movie to the game was really annoying it makes you wonder if they were just making up for lose time i beg anyone who reads this not to see it not worth the time
this reminded me soo much of michael crappy dirty weekend with awful english low budget i must say i am a fan of both exploitation and serious film i appreciate say demented for ineptitude and last house on the left for sheer unashamed brutality and any number of inventive and increasingly brutal italian spin was just pointless though kind of like a british budget director thought remake i spit on your grave without making it too harrowing now that horror is back in fashion with whole thing just doesn't hang together or have a point with the daughter why bother having the man be an expert in security cameras crappy
this movie sucked they took something from my childhood and raped it in an outhouse this movie was so bad i wanted to go home and hold my dukes dvds and cry in a corner the cast was terrible it wasn't the dukes it was stiffler and jackass driving a car when was boss hogg evil when was rosco a tough guy they never were boss hogg was greedy and rosco was an idiot when did jesse smoke pot he never did now don't get me very liberal and nothing wrong with a little chiba but it had no place in this movie the only thing good about this movie was the trailers before the movie and the end credits it was a waste of money time and air avoid at all costs
it is not un-common to see re-makes of foreign movies that fall flat on their face but here is the flip side this is an awful re-make of the movie wide awake by the awake is strange but entertaining and funny liam on the other hand is just strange i must give credit to liam for one thing and that is making it clear that i made the right choice in changing my religion
wig does not look good she is not cute and pretty enough to play annie annie sticks out in the movie as her outfits look like halloween costumes terrible acting and terrible plots this movie is such a change from the version i think that a younger and smaller girl should have had the lead role ashley johnson portrays a very boyish annie not appealing at all at least the casting director got it right with daddy warbucks ms hannigan was also miscast camilla belle played molly alright warning this movie might insult your iq so you might just want to only show it to very young children and younger some of the plots are too fictional and could hardly take place in the real world
quite one of the worst films i have ever seen terrible acting laughable action clear that the cars are travelling slowly atrocious script hideously unsatisfying ending and incompetent direction make a hash of a movie we know judge reinhold is a fine actor but he should be ashamed of this detritus there is no great tension within the car and when the characters stumble upon moments of hope they laugh like inane banshees for some reason even high five-ing when they see the bridge the chain of events that lead these people to share the same car strains credibility apparently based on true events though if the case truth is evidently stranger than fiction unfortunate then that it was portrayed in such an inept manner
almost every plot detail in this movie is illogical and implausible it carries no semblance of a genuine human story dead and dull it is a parody of hollywood with trumpet musical bits that remind you of a denzel washington movie wobbly camera shots and focusing racist stereotypes absolutely unnecessary and comical shots and gestures of famous people in clothing catalogue poses it is made to cater for the multitude of zombies whose meaning in life derives from watching celebrity names the only good thing in the movie is the end credits and funky song that accompanies it i feel like an idiot for watching this save yourself
plot is not worth discussion even if it hints at corruption murder power and the rest of thriller related topics characters are interesting though sometimes not realistic but interesting is slow like tea drinking ceremony visuals not stunning but good enough to ease the eye strain good movie to watch after dinner before going to bed nothing shocking too much nothing overexciting movie sitcom liked woody excellent performance had to fight the plot inadequacy and did the job pretty good the rest are bearable though very predictable the whole is watchable and better than most tv shows
i caught this a few months ago on family channel and having some memories of the tv show from my youth decided to watch it along with my year old daughter i should have got some psychedelic mushrooms to go along with it cause this is just bizarre not only is it a musical with annoyingly forgettable tunes the requisite cheesy effects and cameos by stars long past their collective primes it seems to have been produced as good acid trip talking flutes british children far too old for this kind of crap in the words of krusty the klown uuuuuugggghhhhh what was i on if you're a huge fan of the whole sid and marty krofft oeuvre go for it otherwise unless you're willing to get looped before watching stay far far far away
only one thing i'm going to say about cat in the a kids movie and a good comedy movie it lost track of how many terrible jokes in the movie that not only sucked but weren't exactly kid appropriate oh and by the way the way the cat in the hat talked was for the plot i completely forgot who cares it sucked anyway i'm not sure why mike myers joined but i think the writers were trying to make it sound like him in austin powers without the swinger talk and it overly but so what it was annoying don't see it-it belongs in the bottom the jokes are so unkiddy funny
this may sound crazy to even the people who remember this i remembered this as being live-action i don't think i ever saw the cartoon but movie maybe i remember it very clearly the guy was in a building kinda like a showroom he even had the red jacket it was dark out and he turned into a red car and there was this guy on the second level looking down at him the spun around and crashed through the big showroom type window and out onto the street and then proceeded to drive off that is all i remember i really hope someone else out there remembers this too if not maybe i'm still crazy but i'm hoping i'm not
this time the hero from the first film has become human and this time uses fist and foot combos against super universal soldiers and a computer which has gone awry and is prepared to take over the world i'm pretty sure it was double team which convinced everyone that jean-claude van damme was no longer credible in providing watchable action flicks however it was this that tarnished his credibility forever while universal return isn't as dull as double team or the still pretty awful indeed with none of the style and flair of the original and no star pairing this sequel is made simply for kids who enjoy professional wrestling as i look back not even the action sequences were all that exciting and therefore this movie is a worthless dud in other words another clunker in van assembly out of
completely ridiculous period film is only a thin excuse for its extensive graphic depiction of the affair with the beast a monster who supposedly appears every century to rape some women pretty much what he does and the depiction of the beast is really really awful basically a tall guy in a fur suit with a mask and a huge pvc tube for a hard-on that squirts copious amounts of white liquid for fans of fake animal porn i guess maybe this is a real turn-on i was amused however by the opening shots of horses having sex in a public square
this was probably the worst movie ever seriously i could actually do better myself it wasn't even set up properly like this movie had a budget and left with change don't watch it i didn't even get all the way through this movie had to turn it off i've give this a because it was hilarious how the producer of this movie wanted it to be a horror movie but actually turned into a really bad comedy basically a bunch of girls crashed into a car broke a headlight and the owner of that car went after them the bit that i saw was a women with a gun telling a load of girls to take all their clothes off what the hell it must be some kind of cheesy porn movie as well
ever wonder why pacific islanders seem to automatically assume the sense of humour of black americans regardless of their ethnic origins well this film will not provide any answers to this often pondered question but it will provide an excellent case its onset this film acts as a sort of old school for pacific island new zealanders which immediately raises the question what exactly is the point of such a task is it meant to perpetuate ingrained stereotypes of pacific island new zealanders or is it intended to exploit this potential market the story is weak jokes humorless and the ending is expected this film has done nothing for new zealand cinema as it is merely an appropriated romantic comedy that is devoid of any merit
this movie will be a hit with those that enjoy sophomoronic mindless explicit bragging about sexual exploits and f in almost every sentence like a good plot like comedy like romance or other human values stay away from whipped it was so bad i left after about half an hour i saw two kids slip in that looked to be about very harmful this deserves an x
watch the version as personally annoying i find charles voice more of a match to pay cosmopolitan depressed mean omar sharif tries but cute and vibrant catherine denueve besides being too old looks nothing like she looks too sophisticated to even think of dying for love of this man in such a only actor in the entire movie who conveys the role they're playing is ava gardner whose appearance as empress elisabeth on the screen is fittingly brief look up pictures of the empress more than a passing resemblance as historically empress elisabeth wasn't involved that much in life
a friend gave it to me saying it was another classic like debbie does dallas nowhere close i think my main complaint is about the most unattractive lead actress in porn industry ever even more terrible is that she is on screen virtually all the time but i read somewhere that back in those days porn had to have some artistic value i was unable to find it though see it only if you are interested in history of development of porn into mainstream or can appreciate art in porn movies i know i am not but the director of the movie appears to be a talented person he even tried to get simon garfunkel to give him permissions to use his songs of course they rejected
i have not yet seen anyone slate this film and i think i may be the was awful i actually didn't watch the end of it it was like watching a boring soap or a really good one soaps are crap the actors were poor and storyline was bad the person who rated it has no idea what he is on about the script was awful people was in an angry conversation together involving threats and you expect the good guy to say some thing really good and beat the crap out of him but no he says if you do that i will hurt you hahahahaha if comedy is your thing watch away please do not watch this film because crap poor acting bad fights bad watch of course this is in my opinion
i really hope that horizons wasn't trying to make a serious horror or even action movie when they made carnosaur the movie is flat-out silly from start to finish even the humor in is funny because bad definitely a high water mark in the so bad good genre if you enjoy the very worst of the worst this is for you
only do alien visitors look exactly like furry armpitted human woman and not only are alien visitors able to perfectly speak english an australian accent they also call their stars by the same names our earthly astronomers have given topping all that off all alien life knows just how mean evil wasteful and destructive us humans are and they're quite willing to tell us just how bad that you ever have the chance to see this movie don't well unless you suffer from insomnia or the choices are this movie or exploratory surgery without movie tries to get a moral ecological point across but only succeeds in making you yawn and pray it ends soon
spoiler alert in this generic and forgettable action movie lorenzo lamas does his usual tough boy act and his future real life ex kathleen kinmont is ass kicking hot chick alexa oj simpson is a detective coasting by on his since vanished genial public persona translation cable tv filler there isn't enough skin to qualify this as a guilty script has some gaping holes moment in one jarring scene partner expresses his aversion to the morgue oj responds that some of the bodies are pretty hot or words to that effect this vague necrophilia reference is offensive enough but in light of the murders committed shortly after this movie was released it is truly appalling and therefore entertaining in an unintentional horrible way i was so startled that i laughed until champagne came out of my nose now a guilty pleasure bc
oh my this was the worst reunion movie i have ever seen is saying a lot i am ashamed of happened in the script meetings ooooooh i know have two stud muffins fall madly in love with the most-annoying-character-since-cousin-oliver yeah that'll be for sitcoms this was the most implausible plot since ron popeil starting spray painting bald men
i think i found the most misogynistic film of all time gist of the lilith was first wife and she was considered imperfect and banished from the garden of eden because she considered herself equal and refused to submit to him see i took those words straight from the script then the film keeps going on and though she is the heroine of the film the only time that she becomes acceptable is when she does what the men tell her to do she ends the film under the control of the an all male than that the script was predictable and the fx were awful apart from the obvious hatred of females that is usually a lot more subtle in modern film there was nothing original about darklight
this was filmed back-to-back with the re-make of conan famous novel the lost world and it film starts promisingly enough with a ruthless organization intending to exploit the lost world and challenger et al returning to defend the prehistoric plateau but then things go downhill everybody is stranded on the plateau and we're left with a feeble boring over-length rehash of the first dinosaurs are hardly ever seen are just laughable are we expected to take that cuddly toy supposed to be an ankylosaur seriously and the tyrannosaur seems rooted to the yourself a favor and get hold of the silent version of the lost world unbelievably in this age of cgi and other advanced effects the twenties version is the best and will remain so until somebody finally decides to do a decent re-make
when i saw the commercial for this i was all about seeing it now forgive me but been so long since i've seen it that i don't recall how it went suffice it to say the movie i saw bore no resemblance to the movie they sold me was bored annoyed and incredibly disappointed by this movie and if it wasn't bad enough they had to sink it even further with that awful reggae music not exactly mood-setting music for a horror movie eh mon i guess if you never saw the commercial trailer i suppose you may think this is some hot stuff for my money the commercial was way better
the tv show updated with fresh female flesh and raunchy language the dukes of hazzard passed me by it was not repeated whenever i was in front of the television in either new york or california or i probably would have watched still from somewhere the clips accompanying this updated release i knew it was about a fast orange dodge charger and the general lee is still good to go cousins seann william scott and johnny knoxville bo and luke duke are the new riders of the orange sage beautiful jessica simpson daisy fills her skimpy short well but even her arousing pink bikini can't beat off the competition from a dormitory full of bouncing topless coeds the too stupid plot involves a graying burt reynolds boss hogg threatening to turn hazzard county into a the dukes of hazzard jay chandrasekhar seann william scott johnny knoxville jessica simpson burt reynolds
i saw switching goals always the same see the olsen twins make same like play different sports and then fall in love to now about the off all such little boys and girls don't play on such big does not play on time the game is at its end the referee gives some overtime minute or the finish is so think that this movie is bad because of the lack of football it were done by european producers it would be also the mane actors aren't the wright suffer from lack of they played some seasons in full house but that doesn't make them big have got to show your that is what is missing in the olsen twins
the last reviewer was very generous i quiet like the first movie but can't say i enjoy this one very much the beginning is bearable but it goes downhill pretty quickly i just don't see jon bon jovi as a bad-ass vampire hunter and the vampire princess is neither sexy nor scary a lot of the scenes just do not make sense i mean any normal person would suspect something is up when a strange woman suddenly appearing out of nowhere to seduce you let alone an experienced hunter why una is able to communicate with jovi nothing was ever explain in this movie you wouldn't mind if it was entertaining but that was too much to ask this has to be one of worst vampire movie i have seen
mann photographs the alberta rocky mountains in a superb fashion and jimmy stewart and walter brennan give enjoyable performances as they always seem to do come on hollywood a mountie telling the people of dawson city yukon to elect themselves a marshal a marshal and to enforce the law themselves then gunfighters battling it out on the streets for control of the town even remotely resembling that happened on the canadian side of the border during the klondike gold rush mr mann and company appear to have mistaken dawson city for deadwood the canadian north for the american wild viewers be prepared for a reefer madness type of enjoyable howl with this ludicrous plot or to shake your head in disgust
contain dude in a dopey-looking kong suit same one used in king kong vs godzilla in provides much of the laffs in this much-mocked monster flick kong is resurrected on mondo island and helps out the lunkhead hero and other good guys this time around the vampire-like villain is named dr he doesn't look like peter cushing kong finally dukes it out with pride and joy a giant robot ape that looks like a bad metal sculpture of magilla gorilla like many of flicks this may have had some merit before american audiences diddled around with it and added new footage the animation company had a hand in this mess they should have stuck to superior programs like the little drummer boy
i see a lot of movies saw the original wargames years ago and loved it computers where still a big mystery for the most of us and the movie was convincing in own one however looks like a low budget wednesday night special total crap from start to plot is so weak you won't believe it until you see the movie i would not recommend in the first place i can not point out one actor that actually did a good job in this movie but hey with that script i would've been surprised if anyone could do a good job acting lots of clich√© scenes cgi looks like taken out of the no i'm getting in a bad mood just writing about this do not watch this to short to waste it on watching crappy movies
if you want to see a mystery don't watch this though there are elements straight out of elmore leonard territory this comes closer to an episode of dynasty since the filmmaker focuses on character development long boring talks between stupid un-involving characters some people can make fascinating movies without real action exotica but not this one avoid it especially if you like the actors involved in this one
considering its pedigree this should be a far more enjoyable film than it is even with a lip-smacking collection of eccentrics in the cast what aficionado would not eagerly anticipate a movie which brings together lemmon lanchester kovacs and gingold the entire event is dully paced drearily shot and more often than not gifts were not essentially comic as she went on to confirm in kiss me stupid james stewart was a fine comedian as he ably demonstrated in movies from ranging from the philadelphia story to harvey i think he comes out better from this mess than anyone else does except maybe the cat
a group of forest rangers and scientists go into the woods to find stumble on a bigfoot burial ground eventually didn't notice it in the dark the scenes of the cgi bigfoot are horrid but better than the endless scenes of talking that they rarely punctuate i used to think that there just might be a good bigfoot movie to be made but now after so many sad sad movies about the legend i'm having serious doubts to pour salt in the wound of watching this film the one good-looking girl just doesn't get naked once and while this one may be better than boggy creek mean feat there still sad that the best non-documentary film on bigfoot remains harry and the henriksons grade d
the only reason to see this movie is for a brilliant performance by thom-adcox hernandez who is underused in the movie within the movie as usual tom villard is good too otherwise the possesor doesn't even exist how does he magically change the letters on the theatre marquee to spell out the possessor lame
i sat through almost one episode of this series and just couldn't take anymore it felt as though i'd watched dozens of episodes already and then it hit nothing new here i've heard that joke on seinfeld i saw someone fall like that on friends an episode of happy days had almost the same storyline ect none of the actors are interesting here either some were good on other shows here and others are new to a profession they should have never entered avoid this stinker
meatball machine has got to be one of the most complex ridiculous awful and over-exaggerated sci-fi horror films that i have ever came across it is about good against evil and a coming-of-age tale with the aim of to entertain with bloody sleazy and humorous context because of that the violence isn't particularly gruesome and it doesn't make you squirm but the gratuitous bloodletting and nudity does run freely the performances by issei takahashi and toru tezuka is the worst i have seen if that was not enough it is also directed by an unheard of director called yudai yamaguchi this movie just have it all it is bad to the bone a must see for every b-movie freak simply an enjoying and rare gem
this is an hybrid creature born at carl macek mind with robotech the second generation masters and megazone into one miserable movie that have no logic the story is very very bad and you cannot forgive the action of megazone when have nothing to do with robotech if this movie have so high rank is for the tv series and not for itself i did said it the name cannot save this
this is a bit of a first for me the first time i have ever been disappointed in a tim burton film pota isn't a bad film sets costumes and the odd great performance but it could have been made by any off-the-shelf hollywood director the pacing was very odd the last third was just spent waiting for the film to end by myself and the cast tim roth was excellent probably the only pleasure in the film come back tim
what a mess why was this movie made this and other movies of its caliber should be teaching tools on how not to make a movie children may like it but anyone over may or will disapprove to make matters worse was the fact that such great talent like whoopi goldberg and armin mueller stahl were entirely wasted in a film unworthy of any notice
i like to keep my reviews short and simple but this pretty much sums it up you can not beat the original two for a number of reasons one of which including the directing talent of chris movie had terrible directing covered up by even more terrible acting i cant even believe these people are considered to sit through and watch the storyline was a complete joke about a secret chip and russian terrorists on a painstaking quest to get it back horrible rent one of the original tow and enjoy yourself movie wasn't even set during christmas like the original home alone was turned from an excellent christmas time family comedy movie to a joke with no moral or plot
this movie is funny and painful at the same time the cinemagic almost gave me a seizure despite what they imply cinemagic is not some innovative technical procedure it was developed as the result of an accident and they used it because it disguised the fact that their monsters were so stupid-looking i also don't think a coincidence that the writer is sid movie is good for a laugh if you are really looking for a movie made in days on dollars it is entertaining at least i can say that about it the is the highlight
devil dog sets your heart racing brilliantly paced the ending comes like a bolt out of the blue and plunges itself into the very centre of your being you'll never look at your dog the same way again in fact you'll start thinking of having it put down by a priest fantastic
was the year this was long before phillip seymour thomas had won an oscar who knew i would be an extra in a movie with him i was actually a paid extra in my back which was shot in a suburb of austin called georgetown tx the original title was johnny zombie god the producers had a change of heart i was in the theater scene i rushed out to watch the movie the day it was released in theaters it is more of a comedy than a horror movie but for a good laugh you might want to check it out nothing that is even close to dawn of the dead or even shaun of the dead quality but the cheese factor is good enough ciao
with knightly and o'tool as the leads this film had good possibilities and with mccallum as the bad guy after knightly maybe some tension but they threw it all away on silly evening frill and then later on with maudlin war remnants it was of course totally superficial beautiful english country and seaside or number one mistake was dumping knightly so early on in the film when she could easily have played someone a couple of years older instead of choosing someone ten years older to play the part they missed all the chances to have great conflict among the cast and instead stupidly pulled at the easy and low-cost heartstring elements
what to say about this movie well it is about a bunch of good students who have some bad drugs and turn into delinquent students that sell more of the bad drugs to people two of those people have adverse effects as one turns into a toxic avenger type and his girlfriend throws up some creature that grows in the basement that is about all there is to it and they stretch it out for minutes this movie is pretty bad and should be locked away forever though that is not fair some people like movies and they can watch it if they want troma movies for me though are the worst movies there are out there i just watched this one out of morbid curiosity
i was lured to see this movie by its starpower but ultimately all it delivers it plays much more like a greek tragedy than a modern thriller about big city corruption greatest flaw is its predictibability and utter lack of suspense we know who the bad guys are from the beginning and just follow along as they fall like dominoes the film to its credit does abstain from gratuitous violence and sex but has forgotten to substitute good clean romance or excitement in any other way all the flavor of a good flat decaffeinated diet cola which also takes place in new york is a far better alternative as is la confidential
this film has a weak plot weak characterization and really weak special effects that i question why i lost valuable life by watching it it has random characters who add nothing to the story and seem like excuses for the director to get his girlfriend in the film the robots are sad and the main hero bot is turned on by a huge knife switch if this movie weren't so bad it would be laughable but nothing funny about it the main antagonist is one of the only redeeming characters and he is killed sad when you root for the bad guy because the best one to cheer for when all is said and done this movie was better left on the cutting room floor or never funded at all
trying to compare or represent this swill as anything hitchcockian is an out-n-out attempt to mislead hitchcock fans to waste on this movie weak acting weak story weak script real suspense no thrills you wait all through the weakness of this movie for the big payoff or even any left thinking what the heck was that all please enough with the movement to make alternative lifestyles hip and politically can't recommend this to i mention how weak the acting is williams did a better job as peter pan and mork but those were much more innocent times
this movie sucks from beginning till the end you probably don't get m any worse acting storyline photography camera work etcetera all bad very very what makes it a great watch it will give you more than enough good laughs the worse the better really have no clue what so ever of what these people were thinking making this movie a serious viking movie the story is goddamn ridiculous more like a comedy in disguise kinda like mafia also pointless but damn look out for the very very end of the movie uhum
here again is yet another diane lane movie where she cheats on her husband is this the only role she knows how to play this time set in and she cheats on her husband with the blouse man i am so not surprised because that is so very predictable then her husband gets mad and throws the milk i wouldn't be surprised if she slept with the milkman as well i wouldn't be surprised if she slept with the ice cream man too because this is a very boring movie then after some milk throwing she says sorry and sees the blouse man again duh then while she is making it with him her son gets stung by wasps my mom always told me not to throw rocks at a wasps nest this kids mom didn't have time to tell him that she was too busy with the blouse man
as a true elvis fan this movie is a total embarrasment and the script is a disaster the movie opens with the beautiful son stay away and the scenery of the grand canyon gives the viewer hope of something special elvis gets in the picture and his talent is wasted big time especially on the rest of the featured songs i sat through this movie twice just to make sure it is a piece of junk out of
weak plot unlikely car malfunction and helpless fumbling characters at first i thought this movie was made during the seventies since the picture quality as well as the storyline and drama seemed taken from an old kojac episode when i checked and found that it was really made as late as i was astonished this is by far one of the worst and least movies i have ever you read this be advised if you see it you waste time when you could have done something more exciting like watching paint dry
absolutely putrid slasher film has not one redeeming quality it has camp councellor as the quips when she wastes people aren't even the warpath slaying teenagers who act the least bit naughty or resist her pleadings for good behavior we run the gamut of boring clich√©d killings such as the slashing to the throat to one kid looking for his freddy clawed glove a kid who gets a chainsaw one girl who gets drilled one who gets shoved into the with leeches one who is roasted doesn't have one original idea to offer and is merely a waste of time that is unless you want to see valerie plays the slut most of the violence occurs off-screen so even that will not satisfy
the tortuous emotional impact is degrading whether adult or adolescent the personal values shown in this movie belong in a bad psychodrama if anywhere at all this movie has a plot but it is all evil from start to end this is no way for people to act and degrades both sexes all the way through the movie teen killing bad preteen sex bad emotional battering bad animal cruelty bad psychological torture bad parental neglect bad the only merit if any is the excellent color shots of contrasting red blond and green leaves a bad feeling for anyone that respects life and peace what a bad mistake to make or to watch it is ugly
i had a really hard time making it through this move it was extermly slow and at times wondered when the plot of the movie would actually come to movie seemed to flow to slow and i kept on wondering when it was going to end i am normally a person who likes a good indie file every once in a while but this did not satisfy what i was looking seemed they tried to make to much out of this movie at one point it seemed to turn political which i am not a big fan of in movies if you are looking for a slow moving movie with little to no plot then this is the right movie for you as for me i felt i wasted hours when i could of been doing something else
okay i remember watching the first one and boy did it suck after watching it i just laughed it off and told myself oh boy just another low budget b-movie i'll never see a part to this one then about years later there came part two it sucked even more but i just laughed it off again and said no way i'm ever gonna see a part to this one then about a year later part came out i was stupid enough to rent it and boy i just snapped after watching it god i never actually realized how much movies can suck these days just save yourself and don't rent the whole series trust me worth every penny
even worse than the worst david lynch confusathon brain dead makes no sense whatsoever shamefully wasted talent pullman bill paxton bounce around like they are in a tom and jerry cartoon on acid there is negligible character development it simply starts climbing the strange scale until climaxing in total chaos do not get sucked into this because of the above fine actors they are given nothing to work with and you will be wondering going on throughout the entire unbearable minutes i highly recommend avoiding brain dead at all costs unless you are into scattering your brain into total nonsense merk
i saw the trailer to this film and it looked great so i went out and bought it what a mistake the acting is a shambles the special effects you could call them that look like something that wouldn't be out of place at a school play some of the characters are so stupid in this film you will cringe the minute they are on the screen which unfortunately is all to often as for a story forget it this is a warning don't waste any money at all on this film it has to be one of the worst things i have ever seen if for some reason you like this film watch troll you will probably enjoy that as well
this is the kind of movie you regret you put in your vcr it is some weird bad rip off version of stephen kings movie misery i cannot understand how this movie got a score because it has no story what so ever and when the movie finally ended i was movie should have been released as a short-movie instead to much time is spent on the same thing and as in every bad movie everything happens just at the end of the movie in a minutes time before you decide to watch this movie be sure to put some new batteries in your remote control because you are going to do whole lot of fast-forwarding don't worry you wont miss anything important
while watching the film i'm not sure what direstion it was to take a reason a writer shouldn't direct his work and even act in it as well you can't do it all i felt the story really suffered in this film due to the director wearing so many hats ms mcteer is the film to add to her amazing talents her portrayal of this woman was why i was engaged here is a british actress who can do anything in my view conflict is what makes drama and a great story i felt this film didn't have that everything was somewhat easy for the characters there were no real obstacles preventing the chahracters from getting what they wanted watch the film for the sweetness but most of all for ms brilliant performance
as a lesbian i am always on the lookout for films relating to gays lesbians however with this kind of crap out would be enough to discourage any kept waiting for something to story to develop or just for it to make some kind of sense neither occurred it was just meaningless scenes unconnected in any way with anything the film failed to conveyed any kind of story or depth to the an hour or more of this nonsense i simply turned it waste your time on this star and it doesn't even deserve that
a terrible storyline at his worst pointless and self-conscious decadence obvious shock tactics and patchy acting make this film like rancid aluminium embody everything that went wrong with the much-vaunted british film revival the humour is at best limp and the pretentiousness of the whole set-up some kind of internet terrorist group ooh how contemporary really begins to summary a half-baked attempt to be edgy that does no-one any favours still always a pleasure to see katy carmichael on
about the baby why wasn't big brother assuming he'd be hungry for a bottle or some nourishment or a diaper change he should have been screaming non-stop after that many hours without care definitely stupid to take the baby from a safe place when he didn't need why was the road miraculously clear whenever anyone wanted to drive somewhere didn't any uprooted trees fall on the roads and block can't imagine the cops at the roadblock not immediately following after any young person who would crash it especially when they said it was dangerous to go being said it was nice to have a movie children could safely watch for a change
this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen i was going in expecting a cheesy movie but at least with some cool car what i got was nothing the racing scene are so low budget they sped them up to make it look like the cars are going fast in one scene a mercedes slr goes from over to in like seconds by just spinning around in circles its just you wanna see a real movie about cars see the fast and the furious series they may be a little cheesy but better than this movie could ever hope to be better yet just watch mischief the best car movie ever made i think
this film has been receiving a lot of play lately during the day on either hbo or cinemax the reason is that they are assuming people would be interested in comparing it to the leonardo hanks caper of the same name the only reason to see it is for the attractive matt lattanzi yum although i must say matt was more than a little long in the tooth to be playing a high schooler if he were a woman they'd have had him playing the mother of a high schooler is just me or is his daughter starting to look like shelley duvall oh yeah the cares typical teen highjinx played by adults
this film failed to explore the humanity of the animals which left me with an empty feeling inside ahead i was not convinced that dr d really had a compelling reason to forego the big buyout deal to help his furry friends whereas babe original bucked the trend of big-budget hits by focusing on the human virtues of the animals vs their humans counterparts all the animals in this film were nothing more than comical caricatures which one would gladly stuff in the meat-grinder more so if one could understand their pointless babble without eddie zany behavior this film would be a flop
this has to be the worst movie i have seen madsen fans don't be drawn into this like i was he is only in it for a maximum of five minutes this movie is so bad that the only reason why you would watch it is if all the rest of the movies on earth as well as had been destroyed
even if it were remotely funny this mouldy waxwork of a film would still be soberingly disrespectful stopping just short of digging up the boys corpses and re-enacting weekend at but only just producer larry harmon and the director of the frickin ernest films use holding the copyright as an excuse to crap all over stan and legacy gailard sartain does a fair ollie impersonation but bronson pinchot wouldn't reach tenth place in a stan lookalike contest even if they were both spot on the film would be no less detestable the less said about the surrounding catastrophe the better makes utopia look like a dignified swan song
this movie is like real life by which i mean not a lot happens in the available hours or so and not much game plan or plot is evidenced by the frequently invisible cast invisibility being due to the experimental lighting as mentioned by many reviewers big bore no big surprise that altman helms this he is a very variable performer we all loved gosford park but pret a porter anyone kansas city dr t and the women aaargh but the fact that the raw material is a john grisham tale and the excellent cast that you will perceive through the gathering gloaming of your insistent slumber makes this truly a masterpiece of bad film and no it is not so bad just bad
well here i go with another b industry movie sad enough to see some badly made films but i don't care if a b industry or c industry produces the film show some effort in your work the characters are really bad the acting isn't in question in this one but plot is how can a tight-knit squad witness two of their fellow soldiers butchered and then go on as if nothing happened what sickened me was how the writer even threw in the remaining members a scene where they joke about how nice the ass was give me a break
gymkata is without a doubt one of the worst movies ever made but not the bad kind of bad movies this one is so awful fun to watch and laugh kurt thomas clearly does not have a lucrative career in acting he should go back to gymnastics but who can forget such memorable scenes as the high bar with chalk the stone pommel horse or the five minute chase scene through the village of the crazies in slow motion i don't think it was meant to be this bad but who can tell not art but if you want something lite and fluffy that will make a good conversation rent gymakta makes for an evening of fun
if you are looking for a film the portrays the pointless and boring existence of middle class lives caught in a web of non-communication and false ideals then this is the film for you if you also what the film to be engaging and keep your interest then you should probably look elsewhere there are many films that do this far better for example try some of the darker films by bergman the filmmaker felt that in order to show the spiritual poverty of the middle class he should subject the viewer to one agonizingly dull and vacuous incident after another until the film finally comes to its tortuous and pathetic end if you value your time there are far better ways to spend two hours like cleaning your house for example
this movie is more deceiving than ever using a suspenseful looking actor like walken to play in this piece of junk made it look like he had nothing better to do than play a boring role like this one and the fact that the movie was supposed to be about some witch and you really don't see that until almost the end of the movie but meanwhile you have to sit and watch this boring film while it gets or tries to get to the meaning of the point and you have to go through this whole trail of boring actors and actresses thinking the whole time of how you passed off another movie and decided on this one and how you have just waisted your money just makes the whole point of time useless sitting there i'd rather watch cartoons for goodness sakes leave this one
the only way we survived this stinker was by continually making fun of its stupidity funny thing is none of the audience around us seemed to all joined movie is soooo bad its only potential is to become a midnight cult movie that people can invent lines and throw popcorn at
this was by far the worst low budget horror movie i have ever seen i am an open minded guy and i always love a good horror movie in fact when i'm renting movies i specifically look for some good underrated horror movies they are always good for a laugh believe i know i have seen many but this movie was just so terrible it wasn't worth a chuckle i was considering turning it off in the first five minutes which i probably should have there is nothing good about it first and foremost the camera crew the intro was stupid just like the ending acting and special effects were terrible please i'm begging you do not watch this movie you will absolutely hate it
this is the perfect example of something great going awfully bad hence can i advice anyone to watch it well i was kinda obliged by the fact that in was in the tiff competition still can't believe it i only remained until the end because the director was there for a that was also anything but interesting it about well the first half worth watching one presents three characters a hooker a musician and some kind of first two lie about their the third is the actual liar the second half something ruin a good evening includes some old breasts and heavy drinking but maybe you will see it completely tiff jury did they drinking vodka
ok the box looks promising whoopi goldberg standing next to danny glover parodying the famous farmer and his wife painting then you pop this baby in the dvd player and all hope is lost in less then five minutes supposed to be a comedy and i must admit i did laugh once about ten minutes before the ending this movie has the following elements a battered and abused next door neighbor a boring legal trial racisim talk of lynchings and death and arson hilarious huh no please if you never listen to reviews please do here you cannot even force yourself to watch this crap crap i said it crap whoever put there name on this should indeed sue
i like fulci films i really do and not in some boring ironic way either but i recognise that they appear hopelessly inept and garbled to lots of is where fulci tries his hand at the epic fantasy genre and doesn't really succeed structurally like most fulci films you've seen some stuff happens some more stuff happens and occasionally one scene might be tangentially related to another really like conan with no sets no script no real actors arnold scharzenfartz is hardly an actor either no budget stupid looking dog soldiers and a bunch of one was a hard one to get through and i could've lived without the inch of vaseline smeared on the camera to give it that hair metal music video look
thanks to the bbc for this show i used to suffer from an inferiority complex i hated leaving the house talking to new people and i had an overwhelming sense that people hated me however after watching one episode of non blondes my fortunes started to change after episode i started applying for new jobs wearing fashionable clothes and i actually felt talented when the series had finished i was running the sales department at work banging a plethora of women and frequently won the karaoke competition down my local if you ever have a confidence crisis and don't know where to turn then take a trip down to poundland and pick up the dvd only
this is a weak film with a troubled history of cuts and re-naming it doesn't work at all firstly the dramaturgy is all wrong very slow moving at first and then hastily and unsatisfactorily moves to an end but there is also that may have to do with the cuts an uneasy moving between genres it starts off with being a thriller to be taken at face value and then degenerates into a farce rather than satire the ending may be funny but also so blunt that i almost felt it insulted my intelligence little there is so the film tries to be everything but does not really succeed on any level at all you can also see that in the very unsteady character almost get the impression connery plays three roles rather than one
i really wanted to like this movie but it never gave me a chance basically meant to be spinal tap with a hip hop theme but it fails miserably it consistently feels like it was written and acted by high-school kids for some school project and also the level the humor seems to be aimed at there is no subtlety and more damningly for a mockumentary it never once feels like a documentary and while the lines aren't funny in the first place an attempt at dead-pan delivery would have helped certainly anything would be better than the shrill overacting we are subjected recommend this to people who like comedies in the vein of big house or norbit people who think that words like butt are inherently hysterically funny other people should stay away and not waste their time
well where to begin just say this avoid this movie at based on a cartoon series the movie makes the cartoon hamlet filled with emasculated actors who seem embarrassed to lousy camera work terrible music and enough product placement you want to never visit yahoo again this movie is really of the barrel to quote the new yorker matthew broderick everett mug their way through this picture with the gay men who have spotted a rare species of paycheck in the should pay us some of the millions they earned for watching
i'm going to spend as much time on this review as the writers did on the script this is easily the worst sequel ever killed navin johnson not only was mark performance god-awful so was everyone elses the physical comedy was forced flat and predictable the script seemed to have been written by mongoloid monkeys using the pen names ziggy steinberg and rocco urbisci how the producers managed to squeeze out such vile cinematic excrement is beyond me they even managed to make veteran actor ray walston look like a talent-less buffoon director michael schultz should be ashamed of want the minutes of my life i spent watching this befouled memory of a brilliant comedy back so i can try and convict everyone involved for this cinematic atrocity
i thought this was a truly awful found myself actually yelling at my tv a couple times one or both of the gay male leads was miscast there was absolutely no chemistry between them and richard ruccolo looked like he'd rather be kissing a dog the movie covers their long and tortured courtship highlighting each break-up and make-up but not developing the reasons in-between in any detail these reasons would make for some interesting characters not the fight or the make-up scene in bed even if you liked the martin and adam goldberg shine as their characters but it doesn't make the film worth renting save your money
the movie was awful the theater was dead with silence cause everyone was embarrassed to be in there watching such trash i think someone gave jet li a lobotomy and made him perform a script with dialogue written by a five year old the martial arts are ok but when put next to the jackie chan movies and the matrix you're better off seeing one of those
during a sleepless night i was switching through the channels found this embarrassment of a movie what were they this is life after remote control for kari salin no wonder gone why did david keith take this role i turned on the movie near the end so i didn't get much of the plot but this must've been the best part this nerdy college kid brings home this dominatrix-ish scene is straight out of the comic books or the cheap porn movies she calls the mother anal retentive and kisses the father oh i didn't expect tongue great this i had to see how it of course this bitch from hell has a helluva past so the swat team is upstairs and surround her and yes yes the kid blows her brains out is must-see tv
oh man does this movie ever bite if you were ever afraid of seeing a rehash of the slasher genre done as cheap as possible and as cautious at the same time means no nudity a classic element of slasher films cut is it every cliche is retread without a hint of self-awareness and the acting oh the acting redefines the word horror i should have known better as the direct dutch translation of the title would have tipped me off
i love low budget independent films and had high hopes for this one but this film is static never mind the production value which is very noble for its budget but the pacing is deadly admittedly these folks achieve much with little but the film fails on the most fundamental level boring the editing is glacial and the pacing stalls it should have been minutes the best thing about the dr jekyll is mr hyde who isn't seen nearly enough he had the most dramatic potential instead we have to suffer through dithering baltimorean-brits stammer through endless and tiresome exposition it feels like a backwater stage play committed to efforts by everyone in the production but a story this tired needed a kick in the pants and funky new low budget technology should have given it a fresh voice instead just a lame retread
a blair witch-war movie that is as much of a letdown as bwitch was the title says it all save your money and your time and spend it on a good movie such as once upon a time in america the shawshank redemption or enemy at the gates you want to watch a great war movie movie if it were a baseball team and the major leagues were the pinnacle and single a was the rookies then this movie was high school ball it was filmed as if it were a high school drama club filming with their old camera sure they went into a hostile area make a film but i don't call that brave around here we call that plain stupid this is a pass all the way now go watch it and then you tell me what you think
this film was basically velvet goldmine if the writers of party of five got a hold of it and made it a movie the film lacks what velvet goldmine had which was good acting writing and basically everything else the film had some of the worst writing i've seen since wild wild west it definitely needed to be interesting i know vh has become a household name for their behind the music shows which are a lot better than all this which would have worked if it was a behind the music episode but didn't and feel flat on face
i may not be the one to review this movie because after minutes of pure boredom and stupidity i turned the channel the original series only lasted years which can be said about the careers for adam west and burt ward put these two actors in a stupid movie and the result is twice as bad
interesting hardly the scientific evidence the movie provides for its point is basicly that jews are a cancer is so stupid and lame almost laughable we didn't know what happened in that nah i can't imagine germans at that horrid time would like or believe this movie compare it to triumf des willens now that was i movie i was impressed with this is just silly part is a scene from m of my all-time favorites where jew as the announcer so eloquently keeps reminding us lorre plays a child-molester and murderer in the eyes of these film-makers only a depraved mind can do so uh-huh didn't know m was favorite movie just plain stupid even for nazi-propaganda genre
redundant everlasting shots useless shots useless scenes are what you will find in this film in other words it seemed technically poor to me the musical bits are amateurishly directed synchronization in the would-be dancing badly post-synchronized bad and obvious improvisation of the actors from time to time etc film is long and boring eventually it makes few point and even less sense are some good ideas though some of the comic elements are actually efficient especially the opening scene however the film gets worse and worse so that it is completely unbearable and impossible to understand by the end trailer i saw was very dynamic that is not true for the film that is to say the discrepancy between the trailer and the actual film is something very close to a rip off
i knew this film was supposed to be so bad it was funny so i went into it with that expectation i just found it to be so bad it was murderously boring the whiny theme song is funny for about seconds until you realize there is nothing clever about it except its intentionally irritating quality seeing things get splattered with tomatoes gets old in about seconds there is just nothing clever or funny about the film except for the premise it could sustain a minute comedy sketch maybe but this is just not a feature film by any stretch of the imagination
yay i think hard to say hard to have an emotion about a movie that has no emotion this movie is as sterile as a scalpel for a setting it has a few stone pillars some stone seats a couple stone crosses and some stone actors they have no emotion the only thing that saves this movie is the fact that it is hamlet and hamlet is a terrificly written piece of literature the dubbing really wasn't all that bad though the voices stuck true to the dull gloomy dreary life-sucking atmosphere the movie gave forth i have seen this version of hamlet on the fabulous mystery science theater three times and each of the three times i was on the brink of turning off the tv despite it being mst an uplifting production of a drama that deserves so much better
most of what has been said about the negative aspects of the film hold if i have to sit through a movie were of even miss the darn microphone boom popping in and out of the movie for almost every chapter of the movie how can i enjoy and concentrate on the story as well as believe in the darn thing when i'm reminded of the technicalities of making a for the dvd or don't bother
the dvd was a joke the audio for the first few minutes was terrible with sound out of sync and segals voice not even his pathetic when the audio sync was better in about minutes the poor plot lines and actors should get another job because the movie business is not where any of them should segal had some good movies in the early days the latest ones are a joke and should be a an embarrassment to him and the company that made segal was the one that handled this he better return to having another party run the show because he has no talent what so ever in film is a complete embarrassment to all involved in its production and a disgrace to all who viewed it i turned it off in about will be asking for my money back at block buster mark from ontario canada
i'm a sucker for a good romance but this one doesn't qualify as either good or a romance i had the plot nailed down before the credits were through with such poor dialog plot and character development i suggest investing your hour and a half elsehere i had to rush out and rent serendipity for the third time so i could get the bad taste of this one out of my mouth
the featured in the man who wasn't there stands for dumb dumb dumb this inept comedy features lousy effects that makes the effects in jaws amityville and friday the part look better by comparison not to mention the movie is asinine to the extreme this was one of many movies to feature the pop-off-the-screen effects steve guttenberg and jeffrey tambor got trapped in this mess but at least it didn't kill their careers tambor would go on to star on the larry sanders show and ron box office smash how the grinch stole christmas while guttenberg followed this flop with police academy and cocoon what them in those projects instead of them here in the man who wasn't there if you do you'll regret of four
everything a great documentary could be yeah if one is deaf dumb and blind everything but meaning wit visual style and interesting subject matter aside from that volken this is a movie that is completely inauthentic an adventure doc with no adventure a war doc with no feeling for war a campy send-up with no trace of wit it means nothing feels like nothing and carries the implicit message that absolutely nothing matters no wonder it has so many imdb fans of course going in you know a movie starring the great skip lipman will have no culture no intelligence no wit than a corrosive adolescent jokiness and no recognizable human emotion just adrenaline darkon isn't a movie a panic attack avoid there too many real documentaries and too little time in life to waste it on toilet build-up such as darkon
this movie is really wack there is really nothing nice i can say about it besides the moral truth expressed in the climax concerning people in the neighborhood participating in the fight against crime besides all that the film had nothing no good shots no good acting and no good script i give this film a f and a out
unless somebody enlightens me i really have no idea what this movie is about it looks like a picture with a message but far from it this movie tells pointless story of a new york press agent and about his problems and basically all when that agent is played by pacino one must think that it must be something important but it takes no hard thinking to figure out how meaningless and dull this movie is to one of the best actors in the world al pacino this is the second movie of the year other is simone that deserves the title the most boring and the most pointless motion picture of the year so going on al
it might have been a good movie if it had explored something more interesting rather than just the surface of a lesbian relationship if this was the meaning of the is quite predictable not mentioning that the two girls resemble the russian group i don't think so there is nothing original in this movie to support it so they had to use something which is already know the recipe the other just don't know what their role is supposed to be most of them are well known people in romania and i must mention some of them are not even to summarize it girl band needing a non-existing the occasion to use bad language in order to love idea was i am seriously holding myself from commenting the title
i honestly want the last minuets of my life only person that is fit to watch this movie is helen keller i kept saying to myself this has to get better this has to get the zombies finally showed up and they had some raccoon paint on there talked like regular drove a voodoo woman asked what one of the zombies wanted and the zombie said i want to that was it out came the movie i couldn't take it any longer can i sue for a ¬Ω hour of my life
for a made-for-tv horror movie the movie started off very interesting i was really intrigued by the story and the mystery of the film but the ending was a total dissappointment the movie was going along fast-paced and was building up to it seemed like anyway to a very climatic end but guess what there is no end the movie is just over and after almost one-and-a-half hours the audience is just left wondering what happened why were all the unanswered questions in the film left unanswered there was no explanation at all about any of the key points in the plot this film is like watching a murder mystery and then never finding out who did it very dissappointed this film looks like the producers just ran out of money and never completed the film a real bomb
joe opening line says everything about this movie it takes place on the island of malta island of pathetic men and involves joe don baker tracking down an italian mobster joe character is named geronimo heronimo and all he does in this movie is shoot people and get arrested over and over agin everyone in the movie hates him just like everyone hates greydon clark i liked an earlier greydon picture revenge because it was a shirne for thriteen year old boys avoid this movie at all costs
my personal vision of hell is being locked in a room without the ability to close my eyes or block my ears and have this movie play for eternity on every available surface in that room the whole notion that streisand plays a only begins to scratch the surface of how ridiculous a premise this movie is the single most important thing about watching any movie is the concept of willing suspension of disbelief it is impossible to do that in this movie
i saw this piece of garbage on amc last night and wonder how it could be considered in any way an american movie classic it was awful in every way how badly did jack lemmon james stewart and the rest of the cast need cash that they would even consider doing this movie
the movie itself is so pathetic it portrayed deaf people as cynical toward hearing people true some deaf people are wary of dating hearing people but they are not necessarily angry like of marlee character was throughout the story deaf people do not go to the bar and dance the way matlin did all in all the movie itself is more boring than pathetic it is so boring that i'd like to believe that it is an insomnia-cured movie if i have a problem sleeping i can simply pop in children of a lesser god and watch it will put me to in mind this is a deaf guy talking
your brewskies out and enjoy this flawed action flick considerable kempo skill spin kicks decent with the sticks poor couch is the only redeeming quality of a movie that just cries bad acting the plot isn't half bad just executed pretty poorly but if you're seeing this movie for anything other than martial arts you're missing the boat entirely and for a movie that is supposed to take place in koreatown way way too few korean actors extras
there were good performances by robin williams and others but the movie was dull overall and very disappointing compared to the positive thought sy might become a serial killer who bores people to death a forlorn guy in ugly clothes trails his victims around food courts quoting oprah and reciting his medical history until they beg him to shoot think the movie mostly appeals to egomaniacs who think strangers are interested in their photos i expect most retail workers want a break from the customers
i think time john rambo move on with his life and try to put vietnam behind him this series is getting old and rambo is no longer a solider but a cold blooded killer ever time he turns up on the screen someone dies vietnam was not a fun place to be and frankly i am tired of hollywood making it seem like it was this is not the worst of the films concerning vietnam that honor goes to john waynes green berets in any case john rambo carrying around a cal machine gun taking on what seems to be half of the viet cong army plus a good many russians is an insult to watch what is worse is rambos cheesy speech at the oh yeah i heard they are making another one
the greatest sin in life is being dull and this movie is crashingly boring its funny its left out of his a life in film documentary he goes from a long piece on stardust memories and then fast forwards to zelig this little piece of cubic zirconia just isn't worth the effort
what is interesting is that the acting was not bad just not enough it was rather lame special effects nor the lines were the single culprit for this failure standing alone they weren't horribly bad but put together was a tragic move the show seemed long winded and slow with special effects apparently designed to speed the movie along but it failed of the blame for this disaster was put on special believe it they were kinda cool appleby was not the best choice for this endeavor though she may have been all they had to chose from with a bit of fan recogniton an experienced actress would have brought something to the part like appleby never did scfi puts out some really good original movies just too bad that this failed so drastically
well this just maybe the worst movie ever at least the worst movie i have ever seen they have tried out these child of satan the anti christ kinda movies about times and none of them is good and this just maybe the worst of them they think that going to be better movie as more they use that fake blood this movie doesn't have any idea in it actors and filming is just terrible cant even make out that line minium of this movie really nothing to tell about but that just horrible how they can make movies like that in their right mind just can't understand that this cant be a hollywood movie is it just don't go watch this use your money more wisely
i rented this movie about years ago and it still stands out in my mind as the worst movie ever made i don't think i ever finished it it is worse than a home video made by a high school student i remember them doing a flashback to something and in the flashback there was a man with a polo shirt oakley sunglasses and a newer suv like a toyota or something don't remember i don't understand how they could have possibly said that to be in the he might have had a cell phone too i cant remember it was just horrible i returned it to the video store and asked them why they even carry the movie and if i could get the hour of my life back to this day it is the worst movie i have ever seen and i have seen some pretty bad ones
i am glad to see most other people here don't think much of this movie either it has some big names in the cast but it there is nothing else to recommend save ogling a few pretty women which you can do in a thousand story involves nothing but unlikable self-centered chain-smoking hip characters that national film critics all seem to most of the public can't stand oklahoma accents are so fake they are laughable the southern racist stereotypes are right from liberal hollywood and the story is depressing
i agree with the previous comment what a disappointment rented it thinking it was going to be a good movie since mira and olivier where in it i was surprised by their performance expected more since they're good it was a slow beginning but it got worse i even laughed at some bad stunts when is supposed to be a mystery movie you can even guess who is the killer beforehand real what happened to say but don't even bother you'll waste time and
giving credit where due only the technicolor costumes and sets deserve any honorable is undoubtedly the lowest point in bing long career at paramount the script is about as clumsy as you could possibly imagine and neither the casual bing nor william bendix nor sir cedric hardwicke can do a thing about repairing it looks extremely foolish in a page boy wig and poor rhonda fleming has a stock costume heroine role requiring her to look adoringly at bing and little else except for warbling a couple of uninspired ballads in a voice probably dubbed for the plain awful mark wit is not evident in any of the screenplay only die-hard crosby fans can possibly appreciate this mess of a film given uninspired direction even the extras look as though they don't know what they're supposed to be up dull as dishwater not recommended even for children
this is a movie that is bad in every imaginable way sure we like to know what happened years from the last movie and it works on some level but the new characters are just not interesting baby melody is hideously horrible alas while the logic that humans can't stay underwater forever is maintained other basic physical logic are ignored chilly if you don't have cold weather garments if you're in the arctic i don't know why most comments here return of jafar rates worse i thought this one is more horrible
all i can say after watching snitch'd is please stop mr cahill it is painfully clear you have no understanding of what you make movies about if you insist on making movies about gangsters i urge you to do research comical to watch movies with absurd gangbangers that even sound more absurd when they laughed at the part when mr cahill goes to a school with only students and proceeds to kick their butts in kung fu fashion this movie was tough as an after school special who had the idea to have hats worn that say where a particular gangbanger was from i suspect real gangbangers do not wear hats claiming there gang that would be stupid considering new laws that add length to a prison term if a person is gang related is the worst gangbanger movie ever made
i cannot believe that i wasted five hours of my life on this rubbish the previous five day offering by this author was highly enjoyable and i was really looking forward to this but most of the dialogue was completely incomprehensible suranne jones was the principal culprit since she either mumbled or gabbled her lines but most of the rest of the cast followed her example notable exceptions were bernard hill and anne reid old stagers whose diction was exemplary do producers not listen to productions before they are aired to make sure the dialogue is audible as a result i suppose i lost track of what was going on and since the original plot line seemed to metamorphose into to the standard them-and-us thing between muslims and the rest i soon lost interest the ending was a complete anti-climax a complete dud
i just got back from the film and i'm completely appalled this movie is an absolute mockery to all of mankind the theatre i was in maybe had other people this movie was recommended to me and i couldn't believe that this person liked it i can't believe that any sane human would like it there was no plot no plot at all it was a joke how can you make a movie about nothing this movie only goes to show why hollywood is in such a shambles i can only just look at the spiral of the horror movie industry and giggle what a travesty to all filmaking this is true of all the new teen horror flicks series it is all such trash don't support this kind of hogwash
fairly amusing piece that tries to show how smart orcas are but in the meanwhile quite oblivious to them makes the audience feel stupid by making the most ridiculous film richard harris plays quint i'm sorry wrong he plays captain nolan a fisherman who catches sharks for a living but is lured by the big catch and tries to catch a killer whale when the capture of a female killer whale goes awry ask mate ask goes on a rampage ask and starts stalking captain nolan ask soon captain nolan realizes that they have something in common ask pretty amazing film-making here folks i got to tell you though the beginning the whale noises and nothing much else is pretty haunting and the end credits the most godawful song is pretty entertaining
if this is based on the true-life relationship as purported between ms curtin and mr levinson i'm thrilled i do not know them personally this is painfully slow and both characters take stupid pills liberally throughout the movie while the theme song gets played into the ground many stupid scenes with people acting stupid does not make for a comedy
when i borrowed this movie from a friend i did not buy it on the package truly looked bad and ugly was printed the ultimate vampire horror after watching it i thought that the marketing campaign was probably more expensive than the film itself the story begins when a teenager is chased by some sound and everything reminded me of my first attempt to make a holiday-video on a ten year old vhs-system if not worse i gave the movie a out of and only because the promo-t-shirts looked kind of cool i don't want to dis film-students or splatter-movies generally but i've seen braindead and i've seen a movie from students that was ten times better than this crap
i used to be an avid viewer until i personally spent long cold hours helping build a home for the white family only to be sickened to see the house a year later all of the beautiful rock landscaping has been removed the gorgeous rock sidewalk and front fountain have been removed all the pine trees and pecan trees in the front have been cut down sprinkler system has been ripped out it now looks like a disaster area they don't even live there any more they live in town and come out only for the weekend it sickens me to think of all the hours that the great people of oklahoma donated to these people and to see the result the story that we all saw on tv wasn't completely the truth don't believe every thing you see and hear
dull cheap sci-fi thriller made with an almost total lack of conviction control room full of computers and other devices used to receive and decipher messages from outer space is run by only one man and is very poorly guarded at night and full of campy sound effects christopher lee is not only wasted but he also gives one of his few i'm here strictly for the money performances
the problem is the role of the characters in the film man to man shows a british anthropologist kidnapping two pygmies and taking them to scotland and then realising that they are not animals or subhumans but actually equal to himself the problem is the role of the pygmies in the film two people who are kidnapped treated like animals and yet given such a shallow stereotypical role within the film the kidnapper anthropologist ends up being the hero of the film because he manages to relate to the pygmies no notion of how the two hostages feel of their point of view of their ordeal i find it is a shallow film with a one sided fundamentally racist view it never manages to move away from the white mans view
watched on hulu too many commercials so it broke the pacing but even still it was like watching a really bad buddy movie from the early sixties dean martin and jerry lewis where both parts are played by jerry lewis if i were indian i'd protest the portrayal of all males as venal and all women as shrews they cheated for the music videos for western sales and used a lot of western models so the males could touch them i usually enjoy indian films a lot but this was a major disappointment especially for a modern indian film the story doesn't take place in india uncle keeps referring to when mac will return to india but i can't find out where it is supposed to be happening
two houses one street one phone booth one car a girl next door a boy next door and a zombie this list of ingredients should suffice for a great horror movie all you need is some blue light ambient music not in the hands of dutch director van rouveroy though like to organize bad movie evenings from time to time the concept is really simple get some booze get some film-loving friends and immerse yourself in the worst cinema can offer for such an evening this peace of filth is one of the best laughs bizarre thing is van rouveroy is still defending her film as if it were a great achievement to be a witness to this you'll have to listen to the commentary track again disbelieve and laughs guaranteed
this movie seemed like it was going to be better than it ended up being the cinematography is good the acting seemed solid the dialogue wasn't too stiff but then about twenty minutes in this long scene with a doctor who you know is actually a patient at the asylum pretending to be a doctor and it just goes south from top of that the demon is about the silliest looking hellspawn since the godzilla-looking thing in curse of the demon also some odd demon worshippers who wear masks that look like the exploding teens from the beginning of the end the cinematography couldn't save this movie despite some pretty solid performances by the actors the story just doesn't go anywhere i think hellbored would have been a better title for this
this is the only movie i have ever walked out on bad bad bad bad bad if they had set out to make a bad picture they couldn't have done a better job i hope they are proud of his turkey i'm surprised anyone associated with this film was ever hired again in hollywood don't waste your time
okay i've always been a fan of batman i loved the animated series and even batman beyond i even read a batman comic now and then so as can be was a little excited when i heard about this series and then i was severely disappointed this series is nothing it doesn't even begin to compare with the original series like one long toy commercial no depth whatsoever and what the heck was with the joker my most humble opinion is the best batman villain of all time and they killed him i wish i could say his design was the worst part actually i wish i could say there was anything about this series that was remotely creative or interesting in short believe me i could say so much not waste your time on this show or your money
return to cabin by the lake just was lacking it must have had a very low budget because a fair amount of the movie must have been filmed with a regular video camera so within the same scene you'll have some movie-quality camera shots and simple video camera shots it makes for a very odd blend i think they should have found some way to not do the home video type effect think worthwhile to see it if you have seen the original cbtl because then you can compare and see the differences but if you haven't seen the original cbtl you'll never want to see it if you see this one first it will probably seem way too cheesy and turn you off from even caring about the original one
anyone giving this movie a good review obviously must have had something to do with its creation this movie is a painful suckfest the acting is stiff the stock generic soundtrack is laughable the direction is bland and strangest of all the teacher really isn't all that attractive the blatant advances all the more awkward the creative minds behind this trash should disband and spread out to prevent further displays of such concentrated craptitude i'm certain that some starving kids in africa could have used the money squandered on this project hell the funds would have also seen a more enlightened purpose fueling a crack-addict at least someone would be getting some entertainment out of it for the sole reason that it didn't give me a terminal illness i'll give this film a two
i was really looking forward to seeing this film but after watching it i was really disappointed the best bit was when stephen king was in it rober john berk cannot act to save his life and neither can any of the others a few of the performances even made me laugh out loud the film was was not as i imagined it after reading the book which was awesome i imagined it darker and a lot scarier if i was stephen i would be really don't know why they changed the ending i thought the ending of the book was very good if you just found out the pie killed your daughter you wouldn't feed it to anyone else would was so much better
batman mystery of the batwoman is in a word stale plot goes that a mysterious female vigilante is intruding on turf and while batman is trying to combat a thorne threesome trying to figure out who the mysterious batwoman is is nothing strikingly wrong about this but there is nothing really special about it either noting really made it stick out of the phantasm had long lost love re surface and mess with his was a major event in the life of mr freeze the batman beyond movie spin off return of the joker dug deep with the characters involved mystery of the batwoman had some minor subplots a lot of formula topped off by a mediocre setpiece on a cruise boat frankly this thing is more scooby doo than dark knight lacking the punch and bite that the animated series had in prime
note to george litman and others the mystery science theater riff is i don't think so favorite riff is why were you looking at his like simply for the complete absurdity that and right well did not over all i would say we must give credit to the crew for trying to ridicule this tv movie you really can't make much fun of the dialog bill s was a good playwright on the other hand this production is so bad that even he would disown it a junior high school drama club could do would recommend that you buy a book and read hamlet
ten minutes worth of story stretched out into the better part of two hours when nothing of any significance had happened at the halfway point i should have left but ever hopeful i stayed and left with a feeling of guilt for having wasted the time acting was ok but the story line is so transparent and weak the script is about as lame as it could get but again stretching out the ten minute plot doesn't leave a whole lot of room for good dialogue
i was so disturbed by the real footage at the beginning of the film that i felt sick to my stomach and ended up shutting the movie off how any can give this film more than a rating of baffles me i know that the intent of the movie is to shock but showing actual footage of a dog that had been skinned alive back vomit as i type please i shut it off after the scene with the decomposing baby i had had my eyes covered most of the time up to that point no wonder this movie was found at the bargain bin in hmv i really have no desire to see any other movie by this uwe person anyone who enjoyed this needs therapy period
i can catogoricaly and unequivocally say that in all my years on this planet that is the worse film i have ever seen in my took my three grand children to see it and even they were struggling to raise a smile during the all tortuous mins the sexual indendoes i will leave for another day but they were as tasteless as the film they should pay you to watch it not you pay them truly truly awful there is no other way to describe it the people that made this film should be brought to task for taking money under false for my spelling mistakes but i am so upset that it spoilt the time i had with my grandchildren regards stephen
badly directed garbage a mediocre nihilist sadistic gorefest if you are the sort of person who likes that see a shrink even if you are that person it doesn't make this a good film the acting is really poor the story full of plot holes the director really should just give up and find a real job as he has no talent for this one i can see why people dislike uwe boll we have had a few of his films on lately and this is the best of them which is really sad a complete absence of any sort of humanity seems to suit some people but here it just grates horror films can be full of desolation they can be miniature works of art they can be just good viewing when there is nothing else on seed is just really really poor
this movie is hilarious the problem is that not a comedy one classic scene involves kurt thomas just happening to find a pommel-horse in the middle of a village square he uses to pummel the bad guys another is the trek into the village of crazies too bad this movie wasn't made to be a farce or it may have gotten better ratings
this has to be by far the absolute worst movie i have seen in the last years when i saw that michael madsen was in it i figured it couldn't be too bad a movie since he has been in some pretty decent films and he was a pretty fair actor wrong no one should waste their time on this film i fast forwarded through percent of it and i don't feel that i missed a thing
semana santa or angel of death is a very weak movie mira sorvino plays a detective who is trying to find a killer who shoots arrows in people mira has an italian accent which falters from time to time couldn't she just speak english all the other characters have a forced accent which is distracting the dialogue is very bad and the delivery of it is wooden the cinematography looks nice but not enough to save this tripe this next part of this review does contain spoilers the climax it looks like the villain is going to get away but then he comes back down stairs to get shot and do a cool stunt down the railing that just shows this script has no originality whatsoever avoid
i do not recommend this movie because inaccurate and misleading this story was supposed to be in algerian berber territory this one was shot in the southern tunisian desert different culture i know i am from both tunisia and algeria the other shocking element was the character of her companion aunt speaks in the movie with a very eloquent french university level academic french while the character she plays was supposed to be of a disturbed never left her mountain kind of personage so living as a bedouin with that kind of education i that context is impossible the most disgraceful scene and disrespectful especially for the people of the region is the femme repudiee segment which is s pure invention from the things like that will never happen in a algerian society ever
this movie is an insult to all submariners it was stupid it appeared to have been written by monkeys the acting was absurd if this is the view most people have of the navy then i weep for our defense this movie was awful i put it below voyage to the bottom of the sea as far as submarine movies go gene hackman must have really needed rent money to do this crap denzel washington must have been high little in the plot makes any sense and the ending for a mutineer to be rewarded for his crime only hollywood would think of this garbage if you haven't figured it out yet i didn't like it and if it wasn't for all the pro comments i would not have bothered to post
after watching the first of i couldn't take more of it i have now confirmed she does not this movie is an insult to the real french actors participating in this farcical piece of junk it starts from a concept successfully used in french comedies heures moins le quart avant jesus christ la folie des grandeurs a historical movie with anachronic tone dialogues this can give brilliant results if supported by brilliant actors and a finesse of direction avoiding the dreaded heavy comedy the horsey-faced lou doillon ruins everything and blanche instead of a comedy just turns into an horror movie horror to cinephiles who want to be puzzled and shocked watching fine actors such as decaune zem or rochefort struggling in the middle of this gaudy burlesque kitchy-prissy farce
another cult strikes again this isn't a spoiler because the real ending comes after you research the folks who brought this overly-long pseudo-scientific school of any needs to hide behind an oz-like screen of deceit i walk away thank ramtha i watched a borrowed copy of this movie on the recommendation of a have wasted precious resources on this new-age lobotomizer would have been tragic i can only hope that they truly believe they can walk on water enough to take that guidance to logical other words walk shut up as a deserves a strong on entertainment value especially for creating the most dislikable character in film history if you must see this film borrow it from one of the brainwashed folks who recommended it
movies like these are to the originals what album oriented rock stations are to what music used to be like repetitive boring and drained of all the original energy by a committee of corporate drones i am glad that aragorn wasn't typecast as an expectant psycho by this go back and watch the version count the things that would never be included in a modern version and thank whatever deity you worship that someone somewhere in the distant past had the balls to write and shoot an original concept movie that wasn't based on someone ideas and wasn't passed through a corporate board before it saw the light of day
the creativeness of this movie was lost from the beginning when the writers and directors left out a good story line only to substitute with horrible special affects this movie seemed to be focused on amusing children but couldn't even accomplish that many small low budget films have the potential to become great movies but this movie is no where near that fortunately this will be another film easily made and easily forgotten this movie was probably a chance for the actors to make a little money on the side until their chance came along for a real role in a good movie anyone who has a shred of respect for films should avoid seeing this movie at all costs
the real star of this ridiculous story is glorious technicolor a visual treat to the eye the film fails to stimulate the mind and heart i was intrigued at first by the idea of dietrich and boyer leaving religion in order to find their capacity for love what follows is a huge disappointment boyer is the only real actor in the production and one feels his torment amazing wardrobe outshines her performance at times her face is frightening to look at a unfeeling mask as a monk boyer held the formula for the liquer reminds me of the true story of chartreuse when he leaves his marriage to god the reaction by his fellow monks holds the shock and fear that perpetuate organized religion the viewer feels boyer was well rid of his past however the journey that follows is all too predictable
even if you could get past the idea that these boring characters personally witnessed every significant moment of the so katie didn't join the manson family and nobody died at altamont this movie was still unbelievably awful i got the impression that the writers just locked themselves in a room and watched forrest gump the wonder years and oliver films over and over again and called it research a canadian television critic called the conclusion of the first episode head spinning he was right
if the is reading this i imagine you are since you should now be out of work then i must tell you i have seen some bad movies in my time but this one gets the distinction of having the worst premise i've ever nothing happens total waste of time i laughed out loud at the end note the whole movie was her in a coma then does the scene where she sleeps with that guy mean someone raped her while she was knocked rubbish
cq is incredibly slow and i'm a david mamet fan the movie follows around a young filmmaker who is making a very barbarella-esque film after that the movie started to lose me deep and profound not really the movie dragonfly being made in cq has the problem of having no ending this greatly parallels cq which also lacks an ending my was lucky enough to catch this movie at the sxsw film festival i had fairly high expectations having just watched y tu mama tambien and several other great movies i was also looking forward to jason performance but it was not an easy film to get into if you're not into sci-fi or slow movies that go no where skip feels like a student film if you want a recent sci-fi-esque indie film rent donnie darko it won't put you to sleep
this movie is spoofed in an episode of mystery science theater i think was at its best when they ripped this acting bad makeup poor effects chick in skimpy i give it a villain is hard to understand due to the makeup the assistant says things like not you that sound like nachoo sneezing just poor oration the long eyebrows are hilarious on one of the characters still don't know what the projected man means in terms of the plot i missed some of the beginning though is up with this line minimum on posting
the ending of this movie made absolutely no sense what a waste of perfectly good hours if you can explain it to do i don't usually consider myself unable to get a movie but this was a classic example for me so either i'm slower than i think or this was a really bad movie
the story idea is excellent unfortunately the execution lets it movie lacks pace for one thing it should be an exciting ride but it is slow and more than a little think the mainly in the screenplay and editing there aren't enough obstacles and reversals to ratchet up suspense and there are scenes which don't really move the story along very producers should have seen this in the screenplay and insisted upon a major rewrite unfortunately when the producer is also the writer and the director this evidently ain't gonna of the acting seems kind of flat and that is down to the director all the actors have been quite competent in other a shame because with better writing editing and direction this could have been a really good thriller
one more of extremely unprofessional movies about computer authors of that movie don't know real specific of programmers top programmers in the world program which have own satellites what program which using satellite freq somebody kill somebody to steal the codes and much more of stupid moments at this who not programmers not will see something awful at that movie because not professionals on this but peoples will see not real will find that movie odd and awful because lots of moments inside movie is not related real life movie not scifi in this case
murders are occurring in a texas desert town who is responsible slight novelties of mystery and racial tensions latter really doesn't fit but otherwise strictly for slasher fans who will appreciate the gore and nudity which are two conventional elements for these kimmell friday the part infamy stars as the bratty quasi-detective out of rated r for violence and gore nudity and some language
this film is absolutely horrific one of the worst movies i've ever seen the story does nearly not exist the characters are full of stereotypes and the special-fx only make you laugh the only remarkable thing about this movie is the guest appearance of the rapper coolio as some kind of police this film was supposed to be a comedy i didn't quite get the point if you want to watch this movie please get yourself drunk first and then prepare for some good when the first special-fx appear on the if you like trash movies made on the cheap this film is a must-see for you
holy this was god awful i sat in the theater for for an hour and ten minutes and i thought i was going to gouge out my eyes much in the manor oedipus rex dear god this movie deserves no more credit than anything done by a middle school film buff please save your money this movie can offer you nothing unless you enjoy sideshows and sleeping in movie theaters you know bring your girlfriend and make things interesting you will be the only ones there anyway this slide show be recommend not watching are pretty this comment was one-hundred times more fun than pretending to watch this daym movie this is sad
i think jason lee has huge potential but this was the wrong vehicle in which to attempt to break out as a star the plot is awful the comedy is awful i laughed twice i think for relief because in retrospect they were fairly lame jokes i found myself scared for the future of fletch and had to console myself that it was the film that was flawed not stiles and selma blair are hot but i recommend looking at the still photos on this website to figure that out instead of this film save your time star
it has very bad acting bad story lines bad characters you should never see this show if you see it on turn it off or you be cringing for the next minutes it should have never been aired not great you should never see it never ever ever so now if you ever wanna watch this show please don't turn to the the cw for smallville or disney channel for hannah montana wizards of waverly place or nick for drake josh those are much better family shows so believe me on this i've watched it before and it is honestly and i say honestly the worst show i've ever seen and i've seen a lot of tv so do me a favor and never watch this show
with the murky video in the beginning and sporadically throughout the movie like someone put muddy water on the camera violence and nudity might turn some people off but that along with the mostly bad acting is what makes a good cult movie i favorite line is delivered by tarquin the vampire alas your breed is dumb okay no one should ever say alas in a movie line unless they're english and living in the acting by the van helsing character and bad girl rally isn't bad i also liked master little played by ron little wicked martial arts don't take it too seriously and you'll enjoy it
nominated for the oscar worst script ever in my opinion no decent story rediculous acting very lousy humor by every means possible if you have little self respect please don't waste your time seeing this movie although u can see the actors can act it leaves you dumber after watching it precious braincells are being killed watching this warned see this movie
there is absolutely no reason to waste your time with this film the original said it all and still holds up either read the book or do some research about the story and you'll realize this remake is ludicrous eric roberts as perry smith his sister could have done a better job having been to holcomb edgerton ks where the story takes place the sets and locations looked nothing like kansas the original is riveting from the location filming to the use of the actual participants weapons and victims belongings unforgettable performances by scott wilson and robert blake soundtrack by quincy jones and cinematography by conrad original is available on dvd in widescreen now let this turkey die a quick death
this movie was absolutely ghastly i cannot fathom how this movie made it to production nothing against the cast of the movie of course this is all the fault of the writing team you take the old average plot dance our way out of being poor and destitute or step in this case but this one lacks any semblance of a true plot or at least one that anyone would care about with canadian speaking actors in what is supposed to be an american setting this film falls very flat on a positive note the directing was pretty good and cinematography was pretty decent as well looks like the production budget was very generous as well my only request is that this team leave the writing alone and go find actual screenwriters to help them bring words alive on film net result how she move is how she sucks
i still can't believe that wes craven was responsible for this piece of movie is worse than deadly plot is acting is mediocre and the film is deadly don't know why wes craven hates his debut last house on the absolute masterpiece of the genre and get me really like some of his it was a real torture sitting and watching this
paula i may be a bitch but i'll never be a butch hilarious line in an otherwise rather tiresome skin flick which features a pretty honey in stacey walker but about all this a real tease who lures her boyfriends co-workers and even her lesbian roommate paula into her bedroom but then turns into a whack job who cries rape and calls for the police schizophrenic personality of this certified is interesting for maybe a little while but this story ultimately turns into a real repetitive one-note affair at least the ending is worth the wait for those who will still care by that time
it must be the most corniest tv show on the air this is probably a escape for jim belushi and all of his bad movies his brother sucked all the talent out he younger brother i hope this show is canceled and never spoken of again except in a negative use jim has got to retire or something please let them go of the air if i here a joke from that show i will throw up and and wash my eyes out with a toothbrush id rather be taken from the devil himself than watch a full half hour that piece of programing i still do not understand why the show is still in the air and running we all know deep down that we want to shoot our tv screens when we see face in conclusion no more please
being an elvis fan i can't understand how this proyect could be done is by far the worst elvis related movie of all time totally unfunny silly and plenty of mistakes about the king come on elvis grave in a public park a mention about suspicious minds in these are just two examples some people in the cast tries to do their best mike starr is funny as an impersonator the tom hanks cameo is a surprise but the guy playing the young elvis the movie lacks fun and becomes more boring minute after minute if you want to see an ultra cheap insane but absolutely funny little film related to elvis i truly recommend you bubba ho-tep instead of this mess
oh just what i movie about century england which is pretty much like regular vandalising football this picturesque setting of and other randomly chosen gainsbourg walks around aimlessly as jane that novel nobody has ever read usually hangs out in she tries to teach a french girl to look at an empty chalkboard all the hurt on back to fall in love with jane and all still the matter of his fruitcake wife that is locked in the wasn't in the some people being thrown around and some carefully spread probably rented the movie finally comes to an looked really something i then
will go down in history as the year the movie critic lead the general public astray first they sent us to eyes wide shut then they hyped up the blair witch project and now magnolia which is by far the worst movie of the year what is it about who the heck knows its full of self-indulgence and loaded with bad acting i always like to stay and watch the credits but when this thing was over i couldn't get out of the movie theatre fast enough most of the audience that attended the showing that i was at felt pretty much the same way dates were arguing with each other as well as strangers an ugly and hateful film that will make you feel ugly and hateful
i went to see this film at the cinemas and i was shocked when i got in the room there was only me and my girlfriend this shouted to me that this film is not very good to my surprise the film was dire ben affleck plays a guy who buys a family for christmas it is a very predictable narrative with him falling in love with the girl that hates him his acting is okish but for the comedy aspect of the film he is not very good the plot line is poor and the comedy almost there are some good points for example the family is falling apart and the mother is very hope this review stops other people wasting their money i was very embarrassed when i came out of the room
this film is advertised as a clever romantic comedy it is neither clever nor romantic and it is definitely not an effective comedy the fortunes of the well meaning yet pathetic character tom oscillate from one extremely embarrassing disaster to another the only saving graces are the competent performance by toni collete and the frequency with which we glimpse pleasant face overall to be avoided
is it just me or is that kid really sister spends most of her time running around after the disobedient little so and so as for him well i know a kid n all but his acting ability is about as wooden as a dead tree so far i'm only half way through and am fascinated by the story but the people in it let it down i just hope it gets better by the end as i can't not know what all about although some supposedly cryptic messages in the scribbles on the wall and a notebook indicate everything is backwards dog is god live is evil etc just seems a little obvious at the moment yet nobody mentions its obvious meaning yet anyway if my opinion changes at the end of the movie i'll update this post but if your reading this then well see above statement
i do not envy barry levinson rachel weisz ben stiller or jack black for doing this film in one word boring maybe the fact that is too predictable the more-than-exploited ben loser role or the not-at-all funny scenes make this film just something to forget even christopher appearance finishes in a pathetic way i was very disappointed i love ben acting i loved it in most of his films the last one i saw before this was duplex with drew barrymore and was not that bad about jack black well apart from high fidelity i've never seen him doing something good what about school of rock ooops frightening
i don't care how many nominations this junk got for best this and that this movie stunk i didn't know whether to turn off the set or file a lawsuit with attorney for wrongful damage to my mental health i have seldom been this bored to call this dung entertainment is a slap in the face of every movie-goer across the planet the whole story was stupid the acting was uninspired the drama was emotionless i am thankful i didn't have to pay for this unfulfilling experience
dull flatly-directed comedy has zero laughs and wastes a great cast alan alda wore too many hats on this one and it shows newcomer anthony lapaglia provides the only spark of life in this tedium but not of those scripts that if you were a neophyte and submitted it to an agent or producer would be ripped to shreds and rejected without discussion
the film attempts to be a in the documentary form but with many obviously scripted fails in not providing the audience with any characters with which to create the illusion of the mockumentary also the film purports to be about finding real love in los angeles but is nothing more than an uninteresting look at an amateur filmmaker trying to make his first big movie
a bad is one of the movies which doesn't have even one positive effect just everything from actors to story stinks to the sky i just wonder how low you should have to watch this kind of flick and even is there something than this is worth watching for well there is a lot of nudity involved but nothing particular and when you just think that it couldn't get worse your realize that all the naked ladies looked like there are forty years old c'mon guys where did you search for these actresses in elderly home anyway the leading actresses has some sex-appeal and knows how to show it again too bad that she is too skinny old all in all skip these out of
former brat pack actor and all round pretty boy rob lowe stars in a film set in a high security american prison i had a gut feeling his character was going to be popular for all the wrong reasons like tobias in the first series of oz but proximity that kind of film more like a man on the run film like the fugitive it also makes a nod to the themes of punishment and justice with james coburn putting in a cameo as the spokesman for a justice for victims pressure group but any intelligent discussion on how society should treat criminals is completely ignored as the film degenerates into tired old cliches of shoot outs and car chases
a failure the movie was just not good it has humor that year olds that will not even giggle at i mean sure some parts were amusing but most of it is not lindsey lohan is a great actress a bad singer and she should be working on better movies the movie should have been aired as a disney channel original movie that is only thing that was well done about this movie was the music nothing like a remade rock soundtrack to brighten up your day these songs are so good especially alyson and walking on sunshine and caleigh beach boy song fun fun out of if i gave it a ten of that would be the music and will be the movie not worth your money but the soundtrack is
it is incredible that with all of the countless crimes that have been uncovered and laid unequivocally at the doorstep of marxism from the berlin wall to the gulag archipelago to the cultural revolution to the khmer rouge one still finds admirers of communist totalitarianism in hollywood and are still making propaganda in its favor it just shows the moral depravity of this particular film a psychotic murderer is glorified needless to say that neither his crimes nor his psychotic proclamations were included that both the director and the actor expect audiences to sit through this seemingly interminable propagandistic film demonstrates the tunnel vision that they have in regards to their object of worship
this movie was worth five punches on my hurter card i saw this while stationed in virginia in the mid i saw it alone so i was not distracted while i watched it it sucked it was the most ridiculous total waste of celluloid i've ever know that others who have reviewed this movie have thought that it was awesome i offer you this if it was so awesome what was box office take end of discussion
linda lovelace was the victim of a sadistic woman hater chuck traynor i don't understand how having sex with a dog is animal abuse as well can be found to be entertaining or funny linda lovelace was a virtual prisoner who was coerced into making these films i know some people will criticize this comment but i feel strongly that these types of films fuel the fire of hatred and further misogynistic feelings towards women this society continues to portray women as sexual objects as opposed to human beings we call ourselves civilized however i feel we have a long way to go before we can ever scratch the surface of being civilized
average surprisingly tame fulci giallo which means still quite bad by normal standards but redeemed by its solid build-up and some nice touches such as a neat time twist on the issues of visions and well-known weaknesses are in full gear banal dialogue wooden acting illogical plot points and the finale goes on much too long while the denouement proves to be a rather lame or shall i say limp ironic handling of giallo norms is amusing though yellow clues wherever you out of limping killers
i can count one hand the number of good movies starring joe don baker this is not one of chase scenes dim-witted dialogue and terrible lapses in continuity made this movie a prime choice for getting the send-up on that is the only way i was able to watch this
no spoilers here but i have been a fan since waking the dead started but the last series of which only have been on so far is awful the stories bear no resemblance to the original idea of the series i found these in the last series jaw droppingly ludicrous as a bbc licence payer after the show i rang bbc complaints to pass on my disappointment i'm amazed that actors of the calibre of trevor eve and sue johnstone didn't object to the story lines these actors have been with these characters for seasons surly they can see lost all direction a good job it is the last series or the next series may start with the team investigating the death of father bentley west yorkshire england
ram gopal verma has proved himself as a very innovative and competent director he had done a of godfather with sarkar and succeeded tremendously ditto for lolita which he made as is been the movie he repeatedly says has inspired him the most unfortunately he has managed to make a disappointing and ultimately boring acting ranged from decent to very good with amitabh bachchan being suitably menacing as the villain songs were awful and forgettable the mehbooba mehbooba song came off as a second rate music worst part was the pacing and the dialogues which were the movie in a theatre i found myself waiting for the intermission and then for the ending some viewers were wise not to wait and were seen leaving throughout the duration of the film ultimately one of the worst movies made by ram gopal verma
about three minutes into this thing i started fast-forwarding pausing only during the nudity is it that bad movies always include such good looking women in ten minutes i was done and wishing i could get my money back from the rental store the people who write these movies should be sanctioned by the mpaa come on writers the bad guys always get into the car with the bomb activated by the good remote control the way its been done since the days of the ottoman empire also to add insult to injury the twist at the end was so formulaic that it could have come from any action movie written in the past years burt reynolds was fine but he should concentrate on real movie is just a waste of time run away run away
this movie shows how racist john singleton is he portrays whites and other races that are not black as the evil that exists in our educational system how quick he forgets that it is this same educational system that made him what he is and failed at it ice character is the epitome of an instigating black man that was responsible for most of the violence in this film singleton barely touched on the relationships between the white and black characters that were trying to reach out to each other when omar epps says i need to be with my people that racist remark spoke volume and john don't think for a minute that the picture of thomas jefferson in the tower stairwell did not get my attention nice touch
mike witness to the brutal murder of his mother and suicide of his father fedele twenty years later mike gathers a group of his friends to his cabin in the woods for a halloween party while playing a game where the guests confess and confront their worst tries to summon the spirit of his late father it is soon discovered that spirit inhabits a wooden indian in the cabin the statue comes to life and the blood bath of the are not very convincing and the movie takes on a cheap teen slasher theme stale story pitifully acted cast members of note are kelly benson phillip rhys emmanuelle vaugier byron chief-moon and veteran actress betsy palmer
i am giving this pretentious piece of garbage a simply because i don't believe there is a worse movie in the hate this movie i hate the acting dialog setting writing and directing i hope everyone that was involved in this movie burns and rots in the darkest circle of this disgusting waste of pray every day that this movie is just a figment of my imagination i pray that i dreamt the movie and that i will never have to see it at local video store in hell
sorry to go against the flow but i thought this film was unrealistic boring and way too long i got tired of watching gena rowlands long arduous battle with herself and the crisis she was experiencing maybe the film has some cinematic value or represented an important step for the director but for pure entertainment value i wish i would have skipped it
come on get over with the pakistan bashing guys bollywood can not only make brilliant but can seriously affect a generation of am a huge bollywood but anti-pakistan movies just make me wince too much to enjoy screenplay cinematography action really happy to see that viewers on both sides of the border are rejecting propaganda and there are movies like main hoon na out there that have done brilliantly not only because they deserved to because of the quality of its bollywood but also because it tries to say give peace a chance and shows that there are crazies out there on both sides who do not represent the masses
usually i'm a bit of a fan of the bad eighties early nineties film featuring now has this film is so incredibly terrible that it was a real endurance test to sit through guys dressing up as girls has been done to death but never so pathetically corey performance was abysmal as usual nicole eggert was not much better this has no redeeming qualities even if you are a number fan of an in this piece of trash stay away
this movie appears to have been made by someone with some good ideas but who also never had made a movie before nor had they considered that a script should be edited or even funny when i saw this film i saw it for john candy and assumed incorrectly that it would be hilarious instead there was a stupid plot about mind control and so many flat unfunny moments and to top it off candy delivered some of the crudest lines i had ever heard up to that time so despite a potentially funny cast and story idea we are left with an amateurish and crude movie that will probably be too stupid for the average adult though teens will probably find a few laughs really a could have been so much better i mean with eugene levy joe flaherty and john candy it should have been wonderful
i really wanted to like this western being a fan of the genre and a fan of buffalo bill wild bill hickok and calamity jane all of whom are in this story add to the mix gary cooper as the lead actor and it sounded great trouble wasn't i found myself looking at my watch just minutes into this being bored to death jean character was somewhat annoying and james ellison just did not look like nor act like buffalo bill cooper wasn't at his best either sounding too wooden this was several years before he hit his prime as an a nutshell his western shot blanks head up the pass and watch another oater because most of em were far better than this one
throw this lame dog a bone sooo may watch anyway an intergalactic bad guy that escapes being vaporised by an over zealous spaceship vincent kol manages to steal a shuttle that crash lands on earth an unstoppable android killer is sent to bring back the villain dead or alive john phillip law plays a ranger that urges caution in dealing with these two visitors from far far away costumes are outrageous and the script is lacking intelligence vincent surely took the money and ran law shows the only sign of bad it is almost comical also in the cast dyana ortelli soles and dawn wildsmith
less self-conscious and much less pretentious than guts of a beauty this kazuo komizu gore flick is worth a look least snapshotters escort wanna-be to a remote house in the woods in order to sexually molest them unfortunately the horny boys a long-schlonged demon who lives in the woods has already targeted the girls for thing even ends up having fun with the boys if you consider beheadings dismemberment and masturbation with severed limbs again it all sounds better on paper than it looks and sounds on as komizu mangled living dead at tokyo bay with his ineptitude he also mangles this effort and is only saved by some audacious violence and some great white panty buy the hype though or you'll be sorely disappointed
i ve finished seeing the movie minutes i still cant believe what i've is absolutely the worst movie ever if i would list all the flaws in the movie this review would take me a lot of very funny flaws because of being that bad got to be amazed with the skill of the commandos assigned to rescue the plane they didn't even know how to is so bad actor and the thing i don't understand is how the production wanted him to be like a hero but a course the major flaws will be the landing of an needing only or tips from a guy in transmission to land the as well as the dead bodys that had almost no blood at i strongly recommend of watching this movie as its very interesting to see how bad can something get
i was china in this film i choose the screen name sheeba alahani because i was modeling at the time in italy and they couldn't pronounce my real name correctly so i choose sheeba and then added alahani since it was similar to had never acted before it shows but it was so much fun to film they gave me acting lessons each morning obviously were not useful they dubbed my voice and peter were a blast on the set full of good humor and jokes this film was never meant to be taken seriously it was a tax write off according to inside information give it a because i have a sense of humor but a for the fun i had acting in it
i was expecting to love this noir serial killer dark irony i was baffled by many choices the characters made i know they're creepy looking but hook up for a cross-country road trip anyway found the pacing to be glacial and the emphasis on moody lighting to take the place of original thought by the director and about it now this would have been a much better movie if someone had just run the script through the common sense-o-meter model before starting to film
without wishing to be a killjoy brad sykes is responsible for at least two of the most dull and clich√©d films i've ever seen this being one of them and camp blood being another acting is terrible the print is shoddy and everything about this film screams seriously you could do better yourself maybe this is a challenge to everyone to saturate youtube with our own zombie related bought this for but remember you can't put a price on minutes of your life you'd do well to avoid this turkey even at a bargain basement price
this film is the worst film but it ranks very high for me it is how a slasher movie should be it takes place at a university in which there only seems to be a handful of students the teachers are dumber than a sack of hammers it is filled with good catholic priest sexually repressed humor bad hair bad clothes the dialogue is so cliched it is hard to believe that i was able to predict lines in quotes the slashings have some creativity and seem to revolve around stabbing people in the genitalia a lack of continuity in the soundtrack and characters that deserve to die because they are so bad i recommend this film for a fun time get a case of cheap beer and some friends watch it and laugh
when i say doctor who you might conjure up an image of tom baker or jon pertwee or maybe peter davison when i say james bond almost certainly conjure up an image of sean connery while a small handful of people may think of roger moore or pierce brosnan but when i say sgt bilko absolutely everyone will think of phil silvers unlike doctor who or james bond the role belongs exclusively to one actor and the problem with this film version continually wish you were watching the old black and white show in fact the whole idea of making a film version of bilko without silvers in the title role comes close to sacrilage
this romantic adventure must have seemed shockingly subversive in its day a wealthy upper class english woman schemes plots and manipulates everyone around her for her own satisfaction she uses her privileged position to embark on secret activities of a decidedly anti-social kind a clever sex-role reversal as her activities prove her more daring and dashing than most of the male characters but naturally a tall dark and handsome stranger to keep up the love interest and this wicked lady is not backward in coming forward when she meets the right wishy-washy weakness and gullibility of every other character make the plot unconvincing in the extreme but those who thirst for romance will overlook that
some here have commented that this is the worst elvis movie ever made well they are only partly right for me this is the worst movie ever made period i have never seen anything so basely crude and insulting and vile and against human nature as this film a true embarrassment to the motion picture industry this isn't even so bad its good there is no campy trashy fun to be had here like in some of elvis other bad movies like clambake this one is so rotten to sit through its painful pure garbage native americans should sue for their poor clich√©d and stereotypical treatment here actually perhaps all human beings should sue for the crime and disservice this movie does to the species as a whole stars seriously grade f
the toy box i like looking at nude women while i prefer hardcore porn flicks i'll take softcore exploitation grindhouse junk like this too under the right circumstances well these aren't the right circumstances these aren't any circumstances supposed to be a horrific subplot lurking in here somewhere but i'll be damned if i can untangle it this is another of those amateurish steaming piles of badly made manure that bores you to tears rather than stimulates you despite all the simulated sex going on all over the place bah if i want to see good sex scenes i'll watch the real stuff
so sad that romanian audiences are still populated with vulgar and uneducated individuals who relish this kind of cheap and demonstrative shows as superficial and brutal as the garcea series or the vacanta mare child-plays the difference is that mugur mih√§escu doru octavian dumitru and other such sub-artisans never presume to claim their shows as art pintilie who years ago made a very good movie la ora sase followed by another one nice enough tries to declare his film-lenghts art works but unfortunately he masters at a way too limited level the specifically cinematographic means of expression as such niki ardelean offers again a sample of how not this being about its only merit
this film was a major letdown the level of relentless cruelty and violence in this film was very disturbing some scenes were truly unnecessarily ugly and mean-spirited the main characters were impossible to identify with or even sympathize with the lead character was as slimy as they come the atmosphere lent itself to over-the-top theatrics little or nothing could be learned about the spanish civil war from this film fortunately i've been to spain and realize this is not realistic in addition the use of same-sex attraction as a lurid horror was also very offensive and poorly handled while the dvd is being packaged and advertised to attract gay viewers the actors seemed uncomfortable in their if they were trying to distance themselves from this guess if you like watching children and pets being brutally film might especially appeal to you
i saw this movie last night and even after a couple of beers the only giggle this movie got out of me was when i realized that i was actually watching it in a word it is unfunny unfunny i totally believe the trivia tidbit about jack black apologizing for making this garbage i can't believe that barry levinson didn't just toss this script when he read the first page moreover i can't believe that i watched more than ten minutes of gave it out of because i love to see christopher walken make terrible movies for the paycheck also the horse corky by merely existing as a character in this movie is actually quite ridiculous
one of the worst films ever not funny poor tv style cinematography bad acting sad to see so many famous old actors barely able to walk let alone act lead female nancy young can't act terrible direction sub-par with bad tv movies occasional weak jokes fall flat even the basic premise of the movie makes no sense somehow they are supposed to stop a wedding from happening but no logic behind their actions slow pacing made my wife stop watching but i suffered through it the old men are supposed to be acting like they are young and horny but it comes off as pathetic instead of funny how did they even get the money to make this
warning this review contains a wow almost impressively bad note i said almost this is nothing more than lots of random scenes strung together in a loose attempt at a story the protagonists cannot call them heroes shoot innocent bystanders for their food and also rob same for similar reasons also tons of homoeroticism which was a turnoff for me it seems as if the villainess only is topless and not naked as other reviews claim gets killed early on but miraculously recovers adding another minutes of audience-torture i can't shake the feeling that animal abuse occurred numerous times in this cinematic abomination if you're in a mood you might find this watchable but for the most part you can forget it go rent the original conan dvd instead
the entire thing is very beautiful to look european location shooting was a good idea the lead actors are attractive the score is then they spoke and the non-plot developed and it was all downhill from there pacino is sleepwalking and keller keeps talking about how bored she dear you're not alone when he does a mae west imitation you might have to hide your face its that painful to can't imagine how either actor or director sydney pollack got involved with this or a better question why it ended up stinking so death is represented in almost every scene one way or another maybe you're supposed to have low enjoyment here maybe its supposed to feel as empty and cold as death but i still can't recommend it
the plot of corpse grinders is very much similar to the original corpse grinders what is left that is different from the other film consists of weird is my belief that this film would be the worst film on imdb if anyone had actually watched it the plot is disconnected and in several too many instances makes absolutely no sense whatsoever the real wonder here is why in the world was this sequel created to such an unsuccessful and horrendous still somewhat better would highly recommend this film if you enjoy watching terrible movies for a good laugh
this film takes what could have been a good idea a mummified year old witch and completely destroys it nora and jim are alcoholics who go to ireland to dry-out they go to stay with her nan and uncle the uncle has discovered a year old witch preserved in the peat he revives her and she takes the form of nora she cannot be killed is the pity nora however works out a way to do is a gothic horror movie that has been done on the cheap it is a sprawling mess i have to ask why anyone would want to make such a bad film i am tempted to learn witchcraft in order to make it at all costs
no artful writeup here because it doesn't deserve one not an art film not even one of those hidden gems you know like those movies you hear about through a friend who saw this amazing movie downtown where they show all the good independents and art pack it into the christmas boxes and dispose of quickly
having just wasted a couple of hours watching this and for of that time in complete disbelief i can give this garbage the turkey of the year award no problem to say the plot was unbelievable is some big understatement frankly i am lost for words to describe this utter tripe not only are the characters completely and utterly without any semblance of originality sort of stuff has been done much better in dozens of serial killer the acting was dire for those who pay to see this i hope you get your money back for those who were paid to do this i hope you give your money back believe me folks there are many new releases out there that are much much better go see
i am completely appalled to see that the average rating for this movie is for what affects me it is definitely one of the worst movies i have ever seen and i still keep wondering why i watched it until the end first of all the plot is totally hopeless and the acting truly awful i think that any totally unknown actress would have been better for the role than susan lucci concerning mr kamar reyes i think it would have been a better choice for him to remain in his valley of the dolls to sum up it is total waste of i'm trying to stay polite to avoid at any cost my rating is and i still think it is well paid but since we cannot give a o
i literally fell asleep times watching this movie granted shakespeare and that takes a certain mindset to be interested or not but this movie exceeds any barrier of long soliloquies and what not that may prevent many from just not caring about a shakespeare based largest roadblock to this production is the complete flatness of the characters often during interacting nearly difficult to distinguish lines are granted i believe this movie is dubbed in english certainly they could've obtained voice actors which could've added a bit more drama to these classic literary would be difficult to rate this movie greater than although perhaps based on prejudices of perhaps age and what would seem a very low budget still absolutely painful and boring if you insist on hamlet do yourself a favor and read the book again
maya is a woman without any interests she just dreams her life away and wonders why she does not feel fulfilled this could be an interesting topic that would need a good story a nice setting and good dialogues it doesn't have any of these this movie is totally boring there are only lengths and no only climax is shahrukh khan but although i am a huge fan of his i couldn't stand this movie even he can't make this movie exiting the movie is not as bad as king uncle and if you're an art-house fan or like it slow you might maybe like it not funny not interesting not catching my recommendation don't watch it
i didn't expect much from this tv movie you have to set the bar lower than you would for midget limbo for any tbs movie starring antonio sabato jr still it managed to disappoint failing even to be a good-bad scene was by rote as if someone had cut and pasted scenes from a dozen movies and tv shows dealing with big business conspiracies into the script leaned back and said my work is done all cliche all predictable and even worse the actors are forced to look like they're taking it seriously when the plot developments are yourself a favor watch the x-files if you're in the mood for paranoia they handle it better also let anyone know that sitting through fatal error is just that
for the big thinkers among us the intruder is a maddeningly incoherent movie from france that gives so-called art films a bad name the story is something about a bitter old coot louis trebor subor who goes searching in tahiti for a heart transplant but beyond that i have no idea who any of the people in the movie were or why they were doing what they were doing with no coherent storyline to boast of the movie loses us early on though i'm perfectly willing to admit that there might be somebody out there who actually gets some deep message out of this film muddled snail-paced drama runs a full two hours and five minutes though i seriously doubt anyone with any kind of a life will still be hanging around by the closing credits
i was never quite sure where this thing was going these people seem interested in what is going on on some mountain they investigate have narrow escapes leave come back leave put each other in danger sleepwalk get attacked by witches who have consistent wardrobes etc etc the guy seems to like the girl but leaves her unprotected numerous times she gets taken off he gets her back leaves her again you get the point the whole thing seems to get around to some sort of sacrifice i think but i'm not sure or turning people into witches but i'm not sure just dull and endless and not worth the time there are some atmospheric scenes but the print is so bad that there times when twenty seconds of blackness is not unusual is this caused by age or the overuse of night filters
i missed the first or so minutes of the movie but don't think watching it from the beginning would've made any difference i found the film extremely boring and was disappointed with the acting i remember patrick swayze and some of the other actors marsden for instance in outstanding roles but they all disappointed here due to a very weak script kind very short part of the movie inside the mines was about as exciting as watching paint dry and i doubt that even a pre-school kid would've been spell-bound by watching the fight of the warriors the entire movie was reminiscent of a cheaply produced american tv series give me indiana jones any day
out of is the kind of movie that you cant believe you just wasted hours of your life as you see the credits role i honestly think i could make a better vampire movie and i know nothing the only thing that does not just suck than a vampire is jason scott lee his character is at least a little bit cool has some mystery and kicks a little butt
i got this dvd from a friend who got it from someone else that probably keeps going on even the cover of the dvd looks cheap as is the entire movie gunshots and fist fights with delayed sound effects some of the worst actors seen in my life a very simple plot it made me laugh my stomach hurt with very few financial resources i must admit it looked pretty professional seen as a movie it was one of the in a dozen wannabe gangsta flicks waiting for so if tired and want a cheap laugh see this movie if not throw it out of the window
and shot in vancouver with the mountains of the low country of south carolina visible in the background for sake they should have reset the location there are no coastal mountains in south carolina visuals they should have been beautiful and the story limped really don't understand why it was such a hit as a book although i have to admit one i haven't read as yet usually i read the book and give the film a miss there was nothing in this movie that made me want to buy the book or even borrow it from the the mermaid chair seemed pretty shallow to moi
so really sexist and classist and i thought that it might not be in the beginning stages of the movie like when stella tells steven that she would really like to change herself and begin speaking in the right way and he tells her not to change well he certainly changed his tune and it seems that the other reviewers followed suit what at the beginning appears to be a love story is really about social placement and women as sacrificial mothers the end of the movie does not make her a hero it makes the whole thing sad and its sad that people think it makes her a hero perhaps that is the comment of the movie that people should take away positive reception reflects continual patriarchal currents in the social conscience yuck
denzel is about the only thing that is right in this once in an early stage this was a better movie someone decided to cut some action and plot points into the beginning of the movie giving away most of the story line in about the first minutes that and ruining whatever build up in pace and rhythm the movie might have had first it confuses you and then it puts you off the dramatization pushes beyond suspension of course there is that feeling of great injustice and anger that movies like this potentially manage to instill in viewers granted it does that so if you are looking for that knock yourself out
if you enjoy films like american pie road trip van wilder avoid this cinematic refuse at all costs it is an unamusing mean-spirited insipid waste of resources that should never have been discussed aloud much less actually recorded and sold to unsuspecting consumers easily the worst film i have seen in the past months mind-numbingly bad for the entire minutes of runtime had it been much longer i would not have been able to write this review without using profanity consider yourself warned
i view probably movies a year both at theaters and at home and i can say with confidence that this movie is by far the worst i have seen this year not ever however i have not actually seen quest of the delta knights yet this movie is just bad joke after bad joke geared to the year old and because i had he displeasure of viewing it on a bus trip i couldn't walk yourself a favor and skip this one in the rental aisle the four dollars could be better spent on any movie by numbers produced by jerry bruckheimer
not only was the plot of this film contrived with the ease in which the two psychos are able to kidnap a pregnant woman without breaking a sweat but it was a terrible rip-off of misery however the main reason i gave this film such a low rating was because it absolutely disgusted not someone easily shocked by what film-makers dish out and have always had a love for horror flicks but this film went too far purely in terms of violence and torture just for the sake of getting points in the shock think most people when watching just the first ten minutes of hide and seek will find themselves reaching for the remote
having low expectations going in the opening new footage at over five minutes of husbands came as a pleasant surprise i won't say the new footage was grade a material but it provided a very solid foundation for what could have been a good all-original this was put together in during a time of one day shooting schedules after the new footage jules white decided to just thumbtack stock footage from brideless groom into this short making for a not-so-smooth story transition which jules and felix adler try to remedy with a quickie bit of new footage at the end giving us the old worn-out ending of the boys larry in this case getting shot in the
i saw this movie a long time ago luckily it was for free i have to be one of the maybe twenty people who saw this movie in the theater i don't remember a whole bunch of it but i do remember i was incredibly bored the plot made no sense and when i came out of the theater the only thing i could say was at least now i know what the worst movie i ever saw was i just was incredibly bothered by one thing if they can make the temperature as they approach the sun low enough for humans to survive why can't they turn it down to a comfortable temperature instead of being all hot and sweaty how stupid do they think we are
predictable hackneyed poorly written foolishly i reasoned such a prominent cast would not be involved unless it had merit i guess competition amongst actors is so intense these days will only get worse that one cannot pick and choose much any more early on we were given an inkling who was was instrumental in the assassination and we had it rammed down our throats ever since the movie lacked intrigue giving us little insight into the victim and only one possible motive for the murder some of the discourse was frankly embarrassing hard to believe anyone would even consider let alone commit to the spending of tens of millions of dollars to make this tripe
i had no expectations other than to be entertained for minutes and that is exactly what i course it is campy of course some of the dialog wasn't perfect of course the special effects were a bit hokey that is exactly why i enjoyed the movie so much it is a perfect fit for this genre of a horror talent needs to start some where that goes for the actors and the crew and what better piece of material to sharpen your skills on than for one look forward to another film from these producers and directors
the concept was ok but hardly original the acting was plastic but the real spoiler was that there was only one joke and a grubby one at that this is a film for fourteen year olds who have been let out on their own for the first time don't dare to watch it with your kids
koen wouters is a flemish singer and presenter in the early he tried his hand on movies as well but this unbelievable piece of junk ended his acting career once and for all it also ended the acting career of dutch actress nada van nie who went on being a football-wife a tv presenter and program-maker i actually did see this in an almost empty theatre because i used to be a fan of the band of koen wouters clouseau i so regret spending money on it it looks cheap it is a terrible story and it is executed bad in every possible way some people think so bad funny i am not one of them i just found it an incredible waste of time and money
i cannot believe how uneducated this movie is like watching police academy except with people that have no clue of what they are talking about there is a stupid robot that is supposed to be a sidekick i can understand suspension of disbelief but this is just complete stupidity not only is there no plot to this movie like watching someone that pretends to be a doctor throw non-medical words around as if they were chief of staff at a major medical facility plus the people are wearing clothes that are un-befitting for a space program i feel like i'm watching a valley-girls b movie in space
henry nightmare weekend is a rotten piece of sludge from is a and stupid low-budget horror film about some teenage girls spending the weekend at a evil assistant lures the girls into a bizarre scheme to perform hideous a brain implant she transforms her victims and their dates into weekend is a completely braindead piece of garbage that features lots of nudity and some cheesy to mention a laughable musical acting is horrendous and the script is utterly such piece of crap is widely distributed is beyond it like the out of
power play starts off interesting but it goes down hill fast the only good actor is tobin bell and he has a very small part beyond bell power play has no redeeming value or interest power play has more earthquakes in a few days than california has in a year the earthquake scene in the mall is so contrived and completely unbelievable and all the action scenes look like a bunch of third graders putting on a play awful simply line if power play was made in the or it would be considered a poor b class movie the fact that power play was made in is really sad is there such a thing as a d class movie if so power play casts the mold
do not ever watch this is the biggest pile of i have ever come across in my whole life and thats saying something the acting storyline and filming were absolutely dire this is the worst film in the world seriously doesn't it even give you a hit seeing as it cost my from sainsburys and it was only made in hahaha this film is like a cheap college movie you can even see the camera in the corner of the if u really wanna watch it you gotta watch the scary shark the best piece of acting i have seen in my ha i mean seriously this is the biggest waste of hours ever
this is the worst film i have ever was watching this film with some friends and after minutes we had enough the plot was bad and there wasn't a single likeable could get more entertainment watching static i gave this movie a only because the scale didn't go into negative numbers avoid this movie at all costs
terrible i don't want to be too negative but this film has an iq of stupid a just couldn't believe how bad this movie dialogs are just very strange and off camera work at times just music at times like a soundtrack for lawrence of just watched this film to see how much worse it can of the side kick actors are total but all my thumbs and toes and anything that can hang downwards on my body is falling to the ground harvey keitle is a great actor but who knows maybe he is in financial crunch to take a part in such a fiasco film this movie should have been presented to all the students in all the film schools just to teach them a lesson of how not to make a film
imagine turning the american national anthem into a cartoon throw in a couple of cute animals some terrible puns and a pair of roller skates and you'd find yourself with almost an exact replica of this remember seeing this when i was younger i made my mother rent it from the video shop about times the story itself isn't too bad just that any marxists watching would certainly have something to complain you don't like america you won't like this film
this by far one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my life i gave up to watch it after an hour and regretted that hour a lot the acting is horrible and there is almost no plot my guess is that someone came up with a strange shape of an animal and started to make a story around of it borrowing some ideas from movies like resident evil and aliens doesn't result in a movie like them if this going to be a top korean movie i'd rather won't bother to see even a korean movie the way this movies is a good reason to believe that not necessarily a high rating means the movie is promising i think every korean who has internet for online gaming rated this movie over the even though has no clue what it is about
this movie is similar to the play entitled blithe spirit written by noel coward the plot of a ghost wife and a medium are strongly linked to writing i'm surprised that movies of this nature don't acknowledge the original concept i realize that the public may not be aware that this is a knockoff but it these movies are so expensive to produce i do perk up when a screenplay is original i even perk up when an innovative way to produce a work that was previously released there were some samples mentioned as topper etc realize that movies are still a comparatively affordable form of entertainment however i'm not please when the taste is taken for granted in this situation the taste is look forward to better produced movie this case i rather see the play
i saw this movie with my rock climbing instructor and we found the entire thing so ridiculous as to be beyond pity one if stallone is out free-climbing by himself no need to carry any gear but i guess those dangling carabiners look sorta mountain climby so throw them in for those lobotomized folks who think that colorado looks anything like the dolomites in italy the movie was filmed well the hollywood moguls have got a lot more ridiculous foul-smelling stuff for you to swallow
you get writers together have each write a different story with a different genre and then you try to make one movie out of it action adventure sci-fi western a mess sorry but this movie absolutely stinks is giving it an awefully high rating that said movies like this that make me think i could write movies and i can barely write
the name of the main character is the german word for woman i don't know if that was intentional or not but if sure got some giggles from the german audience at the fantasy film festival last year when it was those were the only giggles the movie got not that it was aiming for giggles a horrible movie for sake a horrible movie in more than one meaning a shame that a premise like that was wasted with horrible even unbearable moments for the viewer not for the faint of heart and it wasn't even necessary to show all the things that are shown i'm not even going into a moral obligation movies don't really have that kind of task or function discussion of what is shown here but this is a new low on the whole torture movement that has grown in the last few years
as a fan of the sookie stackhouse books i find this series to be a totally crass representation of them vampire bill is not very good looking and looks much older than described in the book i found that they have made already wonderfully colourful characters seem very course and vulgar one of the things i loved about the books is that despite all the crap that she is going through sookie is always a lady and yet in the tv series she doesn't seem like that at all not only that but the prejudices displayed in the tv series are not nearly as wide spread in the books i didn't expect an exact replica of the books but i at least expected the feel of them to be used for the series
this is a well made informative film in the vein of pbs frontline the problem is frontline already did this piece and managed to bring l paul bremer in to tell his side of the story more troubling is the fact that the director of the film charles former think tank wonk was a war supporter until the occupation went south what did he think would happen invasion of poland went really well too until it was messed up by those pesky that is what this film feels apology for occupation rather than a deconstruction of the act of war itself seems to suggest that the war could have been run if any war can be better
roy rogers and company try to bring sintown back to life a ghost town which may go boom if silver mining is successful andy devine cookie slapsticks around jane frazee carol loses a piece of her bitches to mr rogers sharp leer foy willing and the riders of the purple sage stand-in is that sing-in for the bob nolan and the sons of the pioneers james finlayson the laurel and hardy films adds to the slapstick look of grand canyon trail a loose floor board delivers the winning comedy performance mr mule kicks its heels there are energetic human performances too but the material isn't grand grand canyon trail william witney roy rogers jane frazee andy devine
there is no reason to see this movie a good plot idea is handled very badly in the middle of the movie everything changes and from there on nothing makes much sense the reason for the killings are not made clear the acting is awful nick stahl obviously needs a better director he was excellent in in the bedroom but here he is terrible amber benson from buffy has to change her character someday even those of you who enjoy gratuitous sex and violence will be disappointed even though the movie was minutes which is too short for a good movie too long for this are no deleted scenes in the dvd which means they never bothered to fill in the missing parts to the spend the time on this one
with all the european studios involved in this one you would think you'd at least get some pretty photography but the local color is kept to a is mira sorvino using a russian accent in order to play a spanish cop wtf the story is hopelessly confused a supposed romantic back story that is intentionally confused is she or isn't she a lesbian serving no purpose whatsoever the cops in the movie are the most stupid to have graced a serial killer film in a long time there seems to be some message about the spanish civil war but since pretty much everybody involved in that is dead one doesn't see the point in the bull-fighting backdrop of part of the narrative part who can tell you never even get a good look at a bull fight earnest hemingway would have punched the director in the nose with my blessings
things i learned from the decent cinematographer a hot girl who can act and malcom mcdowell couldn't stop this movie from won't give you your money when he reads the script and says ugh really malcom mcdowell still carrington desperately needs acting a hates me too and punished me by making me pay to see this making a movie you don't need an ending just leave everything unexplained unresolved an uninteresting enough so that the audience falls asleep before the ending random landlord can cure death just by drawing a cross on a window so make maid can sing you back to carrington still needs acting roommate will hate you and make fun of you if you bring home this will not be accepted
the only thing that kept me from vomiting after seeing this movie was the fact that these are just actors and not the freak show that usually appears on the tv show this is also the main reason that fans of the tv show won't like the movie but not the only reason this movie has about as much entertainment value as getting a root canal it approaches the abyssmal depths of bad movie making and then gets even worse i won't waste your time describing this movie in further detail suffice it to say that i pity the poor camera people who had to suffer through watching this the first time
this is the worst sequel on the face of the world of movies once again it doesn't make since the killer still kills for fun but this time he is killing people that are making a movie about what happened in the first movie which means that it is the stupidest movie watch this if you value the one precious hour during this movie then don't watch it you'll want to ask the director and the person beside you what made him make it because it just doesn't combine the original makes of horror action and let your children watch this teenager young child or young adult this movie has that sorta impact upon people
ok i wrote a scathing review the movie is awful as i was waiting another review derrida of mine to pop up i decided to check out old reviews of this awful movie look at all the positive reviews they all i say all come from contributors have have not rated any other movie other than this one crimminy and wait till you to the rosebud the other movies rosebud reviewed and had glowing recommendations for oh shoot they happen to be for the only other movies by the two writers and director holy window-wipers tony you suck as writers and tony you couldn't direct out of a bad script no jobs for check positive reviews for a low rated movie
i bought this movie and after i watched it i decided that i did not care for it the acting was bad was the principal a robot he had no personality and his facial expression didn't change through the whole movie at times the voices didn't match up people talking and their lips didn't even move
after eagerly waiting to the end i have to say i wish i wouldn't have joined the whole series at the first place the final episode was everything against the previous seven years it has ruined everything the journey was years but captain janeway has the power to reduce it let say seven years only why seven why not just one or nothing why not avoid the whole adventure crewmemebers were dying all along the journey why she wants to save seven of nine only the others don't count or what the most ridiculous part when the crew states that getting home is not really the most important thing to them as the say journey is more important than the destination unbelievable and at the finale scene the are surrounded by other federation ships and the earth is in sight nothing about landing returning to the normal ending ever
it is enjoyable and fast-paced is no way on earth that the actor playing mat could be eighteen however the main thing is that he does act eighteen very convincingly it must be a credit to his audition that he convinced them to cast him i quite soon accepted him as being a naive young country his was the best performance most of the others were also very engaging in particular the interplay between the policemen was natural and well-balanced and worked very is only about minutes long so the plot is not complex more key is the style of the whole thing it is very slick and vibrant and the backdrops are atmospheric especially from the fact that all the colours are extremely rich the gangland is identifiable to foreign audiences but still manages to be distinctly australian
don't waste your time on this dreck as portrayed the characters have no redeeming values and watching them interact is sheer torture gothic was entertainment at least this is crap if you like watching pretentious and spoiled poets straining to outwit each other this may be right up your alley lord byron is portrayed as a complete jerk and why the others would choose to spend more than five minutes with him is truly bewildering mary shelly appears to be the only character with any spine whatsoever but even she comes out of the whole ordeal without an ounce of respect what a waste of time see gothic instead i also remember seeing another superior movie based on the same subject matter but didn't catch the title i was hoping this was it but no such luck not recommended
to be honest i knew what to expect before i watched this film and i've got to say it has the worst acting i've ever seen it does have its moments and on a comedy level its very entertaining but i'm afraid its not scary and stupidity is taken to a new level a lot of unnecessary gore and the plot is all over the place i have no idea why the aliens were evil and why they even came to this remote part of wales mean who'd go there anyway but i didn't care at that point because i was amused by the costumes and the bad cgi as far as b-movies go this deserves the title of being so bad its good and kudos to the film-makers because they probably knew what they were doing long may these films continue
even years later ninja mission stands out as the worst movie i ever managed to sit through scandanavian ninjas silently enter a scene fire their obnoxiously noisy sub-machine guns with wild abandon and then silently leave wow how will we find those silent invisible assassins just follow the shell casings and bad dialog was it brilliant and just poorly translated not an asian in sight in the cast and a whopping total of asians among the stunt crew the plot is ridiculous the acting pretty much non-existent then again ninja can't act save yourselves avoid watching at all costs
not too keen on this really the story is pretty horrid and unconvincing i enjoyed the first minutes bill nunns good after that it was pretty appalling tim doesn't fit the role he comes across as a smug self inflated ass pruitt taylor vince is entirely unconvincing as a trumpet player a idealist film and as a musician feel slightly offended after watching it no scenes of practising or playing with his fellow band mates completely self indulgent i find it hard to build any relationship with this kind of character maybe i'm watching the wrong film if you have no real passion for life or sense of what musics all about then happily indulge in the suspension of disbelief and watch this waffle
did anyone stop to realise what sort of movie they were producing here now a former marine officer becomes assinged to a group of kids at a cadet school so this should be a family comedy right wrong this is just a gross comedy aimed at teenagers with many bad taste moments it might have been watchable in an extremely dumb way at this point but i found damon wayans voice to be irritating beyond belief does he speak like that in real life if he does then he has my sympathy but he be getting any of my money from watching his movies
end game started well the least said about the end the better it seemed like things we're happening just to keep the plot going for example the reporter who at first is a very inquisitive intelligent person half way through does something really stupid and totally out of character we are given no reason for this apart from the next scene wouldn't make sense without it the whole story could have been told in about minutes it would have made an average tv political drama the brilliant cuba gooding jr is very watchable however and james woods does an admirable job end game was honestly one of the worst films i've ever saying something i've seen gigli
amateurish in the extreme camera work especially overwrought documentary camera operators needn't spin around all the script is truly inane and the acting is even worse on top of that the story is disjointed and meandering with some gaping holes in logic at one point the lead wishes to get thrown in jail in order to rub shoulders with suspected al-quada operatives and thus get an interview with osama i found the story entirely unbelievable as a result of so many flaws the role really portrays a rash idiot frat boy the only item of interest really is that the filmmakers did in fact film on location truly a shame they wasted their opportunity to make something financed this crap
i saw the movie late one night on cable and could not believe how bad it was i usually enjoy bad movies but this one was so revolting that it wasn't even entertaining some of the highlights of this film include the absurd music which is constantly playing throughout the movie the hideous special effects someone is shot with a laser gun they turn neon green and promptly disintegrate and the disgusting acting the acting in fact is what i feel steals the show i didn't recognize any of the actors in the movie and i hope that i never have to see any of them again overall i recommend renting this movie you can find it i can't imagine a video store carrying this garbage just so that you can learn to appreciate quality films after seeing this trash
while leon is cute on snl only on for a minute like most snl skits-to-movies this one can't fill minutes it has some cute moments ones you've seen in the trailer but the actors are largely wasted tim meadows does his best but the plot just doesn't have many high points will farrell has a bit part farrell may be the funniest man alive but not in this movie what a shame
the only reason i give it a is that filmography is so stylized these days such that it has at least something to comment film is asinine like so many other century grind house fodder the gore is gratuitous and simply revolting i didn't care about any of the characters but i did care that some cretin bothered to pen this crap i'd complain about the money i spent but my date and i wisely left after minutes and went to an adjoining theater to watch the adventurous and entertaining live free or die hard which probably got a much higher rating from me simply because i endured the utter poop of captivity for minutes
this movie surely has one of the strangest themes in history right up there with ed impassioned defense of cross-dressing in glen or subject playing bridge the park avenue set plays it the bohemians play it the russians who speak very questionable russian and have most unconvincing accents when they speak english play it at the restaurant where they one isn't interested in bridge one even despite the great cast isn't likely to be much interested in this bizarre young and paul lukas are fine mchugh is an unlikely ghost writer as lukas is an unlikely russian but they are all sunk by the fetishistic script
this was a classic case of something that should never have been gloria was now a single mother her husband had left her because she wouldn't live in some commune with him was mad that reagan had been elected and wanted to turn his back on society right then and there i had problems with the series come on i say to myself is this the same noble michael stivic that countered archie right winged philosophies the series went on but it just didn't have any pizazz whatever momentum sally struthers gained from all the family was long gone maybe if the series had been given another name and presented as being totally independent of all in the family it might have worked out ah well show business
with this cast and budget you will expect cusack has made a number movies that border on the strange yet still work neither he his sister nor sir ben could do anything to save this travesty of trite poorly written movie is nothing more than a series of sight gags and poor ones at that the plot goes nowhere the writing is contrived senseless and the characters paper thin if you think of a movie as being three dimensional where the story and characters bring a depth to the imagery this stinker comes across as flat as steamboat appearance in this brought back memories of another truly awful movie nothing but trouble frankly this movie is the type of project that kills careers and gets agents fired
to movie felt like one of those after school lower budget and lower everything guess this was supposed to an inspirational movie of some it didn't work for some how it comes across as has very pale shades of flash so just isn't any excitement in this dialogue is contrived and clich√©d to whole movie feels like a bad acting was less than that has a lot to do with what the actors were in this work top of that is the poor song really bad felt embarrassed for all the actors are all you can't tell from this is just my opinion of i have to give flying aka dream to believe a
while traveling in the mountains a man is attached by a mysterious creature that promptly departs leaving no trace of its presence unbeknownst to the man he has been attacked by a werewolf and now inherited the curse associated with such creatures now our hero must race against time to rid himself of this dreadful affliction before the next full moon according to the dvd re-produced from the original spanish the fury of the wolf man loses whatever charms it may have possessed in its original form lycanthropic paul werewolf characterization is uneven and ineffectual dominatrix scientist perla cristal and sexy assistant ver√≥nica luj√°n never get close enough to truly titillate the often incoherent storyline isn't even ghoulishly amusing
chances are if i watched this again i might get physically sick the film is so you believe in psychics re-incarnation and the other pocus which this promotes big-time the re-cycling of souls they call it here story has been done several times before with such films as heaven can wait also been done a lot better too bad they had to waste the talents of robert downey jr cybill shepherd ryan o'neal and mary stuart least a pretty tame film language-wise about the only redeeming quality of this movie
when the magic of lassie opened at radio city music hall i was foolish enough to believe it would be as heart-warming as some of the first lassie films were story was abysmal the songs by the sherman brothers were way below their usual level the characters were uninspired and james stewart and mickey rooney had both seen much better too i was interested in seeing what alice contribution would be like since she'd been absent from the screen for so many years and was always so fetching in her earlier roles at fox alice too was letdown by the foolish script and the unflattering photography another original here nothing even remotely interesting for an adult to clearly no magic present for anyone you can skip this one without missing a thing
sophia loren plays aida in one of the worst films of all time she can't lipsync in terms of production values the film is so bad that at one point while loren is mouthing o patria mia she leans onto what looks to be a stone wall for support and the canvas set billows and shakes
this has got to be one of the worst movies ever made even for a biker movie rock bottom the minimal plot involves a gang of bikers taking over a small town original and the attempts to fight them off why don't they call for outside help who knows the fight scenes are obviously fake adam west and tina louise are in it but both have little to do and both look ashamed to be there this movie belongs in the trash heap
i will keep this as short as possible as this piece of crap barely warrants a mention zombie is one of the worst films ever made right up there with schnaas other horrible zombie entry zombie doom violent these films suck so bad that everyone involved in their creation should be shot i somehow managed to sit through zombie doom but zombie is so horribly inept even when compared to schnaas other horrible film that i had to fast-forward through everything after the first minutes zero acting skills inept gore horrible camcorder-style camera-work ridiculous just goes on and on i really can't find a single thing redeeming about this garbage and i can usually find something redeeming in just about any film this truly is one of the worst films ever made you've been
i saw attic thinking that i would be in for an enjoyably visceral ride however it was not to be the case visceral yes but enjoyable that would be a big fat no in fact the only reason that i gave it a is due to the fact that gunnar hansen appears so briefly as one of the reprehensible characters how they ever lured mr hansen into this piece i'll never know the story idea is interesting but poorly executed the direction is pedestrian and the acting is mediocre the only thing that is worse than that are the special effects yikes i've seen better effects in a grade school play give it up mr w time for a career hear they're hiring at diner there are very few well made inde movies coming out of attic isn't one of them
this mess is so bad it doesn't even qualify as horror talent is completely wasted in this film she is not even the villain the rest of the actors look like porno wannabes and the plot is so lame i won't even mention yourself a favor and skip to the end credits to hear upcoming band twomarlowe perform better than sex total disco candy song nice up tempo song about gambleing sex way more entertaining than bleed put it this way when one has the equipment to copy videos but decides only to record the song at the end of movie you have a really bad movie
there are only two movies i would give a to this stinker and the man who fell to earth i remember seeing protocol at a theater in the early when i was in high school the script is insulting to anyone a high school intelligence it completely lost me with the hillarious gag of someone getting shot in the butt goldie hawn is supposed to be charming but comes across as vapid and moronic then there are offensive stereotypes about arabs followed by goldie winning over everyone by spouting populist dribble the acting was terrible including goldie i could not stand to see another movie she was in until imo she redeemed herself in everyone says i love you this is the kind of movie you make if you want to put no effort into screenplay writing the worst
while i totally disagree with one reviewer who described charley chase as unfunny in this film he certainly is a shame as i suspect the other reviewer must have only seen a few charley chase duds and assumed the guy wasn't funny films like mighty like a moose and what price goofy are very good chase films so he could be really funny given good material unfortunately in this film given absolutely nothing even the inclusion of the usually good oliver hardy as a foil isn't any help because the basic premise wants to marry girl but father thinks the boy is a wuss and the gags are so poor a shame as i really wanted to love this film but the way for those used to the look for charley from the on you'll be pretty surprised as chase sports no glasses or looks very little like you'd expect
richard early running down the street on fire incident must have affected him somehow in his stand jokes about it getting great laughs it seemed to have done something involving the projects he chose the toy is about the lamest he ever from i guess another movie where a white man buys his son a black man nice little bit of underlying political incorrectness before thee was such a thing seeing richard getting all sentimental that made me finally walk out before the end i wanted to see pryor get even with this it becomes the misunderstood kid nauseum at least gleason had his moments ignore this and watch pryor with gene wilder or any of his stuff this is a waste of any movie time
i saw this film yesterday i rented the dvd from blockbuster in fact i know one of the actresses from the film i won't say who kept under wraps but i must admit it wasn't as good as i thought it would be tom savini hats down to this guy but a shame he wasn't in the film for long what lacks the film is the idea the script sound etc it may look like a good movie but it wasn't that i'm glad my sister paid for renting from blockbuster i chose this one and i was disappointed anyway thumbs down for me not my cup of tea out of
not funny how can anyone link this to monty python that is absolutely ridiculous there are no laughs this is not funny over the top but ugly weird just for weird sake and it seems to me these people were on something all the time unfortunately something that did not make them should be given some points for effort etc whatever actually it appears there is a laugh track or is there one hummm since there are barely any laughs a debatable i'm doing it injustice maybe some sort of exercise some sort of art in that case anything goes never these guys playing women with high-pitched voices turned-up noses come on not funny is only one heir apparent to monty pythons intellectual wit and that is stephen colbert and maybe jon stewart
woman hopkins as virginia chases man mccrea as kenneth for father winninger as woman wants to get man to invest some of deceased money in business venture but father is notorious for losing money on hair-brained schemes little does anyone know but real evil schemers are posing as best friends in order to steal his production looks engaging but the story fails to engage the players don't play drunk well notable as broderick first appearance as gopher hunk other than running errands mr crawford gets pinned to the floor by mr mccrea woman chases man john g blystone miriam hopkins joel mccrea charles winninger broderick crawford
recently viewed this atrocity in my film program and i thought it was awful as i said in my tagline it was pretentious trite petty and phenomenally consider myself a fan of film and all the things that film has to offer if i want to watch a documentary on the cannes festival i will watch they would probably be alot more objective about dont recommend it
basically cruel intentions is cruel intentions again only poorly done the story is exactly the same as the first one some of the lines with only a few exceptions the cast is more unknown and definitely less talented instead of being seductive and drawing me into watching it i ended up feeling dirty because it compares to watching a soft-core porn i'm not sure whether to blame some of the idiotic lines on the actors or the i always feel bad saying that because i know how hard it is to do it was basically a two-hour waste of my life it literally amazes me that some movies get made and this is no can't believe they'd make a third one
with all due disrespect for this george stevens sr epic of miscastings and misreadings i can only wonder that the james dean legend could survive this outing i submit that then-studio obeisances to bankable box office giants came a cropper of its own gigantismoses nor were rock and liz that much better off let us just say that the televised dallas was the authentic heir even if latterday texans like lay and delay not to mention our putative president of these here yewbenighted states of amurrika perform a one-upsmanship of dastardly global dimensions i never read edna original but will lay odds it is head and shoulders superior to what got on screen herein and all those well-paid i would imagine supporting actors of note and celebrity notwithstanding giant is to me at least a midget of scant merit never mind the promo campaigns
picture the fugly annoying goth kids from college in a scat film throw in a pinch of story and a whole lot of awful acting and you are still not even close to how bad this movie badly bad effects worse acting contrived attempt at shocking horror everyone i've showed this to gets kinda depressed watching it the sex scenes are disturbing not necessarily for their content but more because they're just something you want to end as soon as possible the last sex scene is just foul even before she gets to the one of those people that loves to watch movies that people hate which is why i picked this one up but for your own sake save yourself the time and avoid this abhorrence that bad i literally threw it in the garbage
this movie was the beatliest mormon movie made yet it made the rm sons of provo look like well done films it was supposed to be funny from what i was told the best part was the best actor in the movie-travis eberhard-if he wasn't in the movie it probably wouldn't have been made he it wasn't funny it was beat it had thurl big t bailey character made no sense it was made in provo it didn't make fun of brokeback it had larry h miller in it it was the movie clint howard wasn't funny in gary coleman chose the perfect movie a comeback they should have cast at surreal life auditions it was made by halestorm entertainment
i'm amazed how many comments on this show are about how real it is maybe i'm not part of the same universe because if veronica mars is anything over the top in a big acting is chewing the scenery with enthusiasm and the plots have holes you could drive a truck through not what i call is so earnest in its desire to be relevant that it only shows how cut-off from reality rob thomas and his staff i found it to be at best a snooze-fest and at worst more than a little annoying kristen bell looks like she could be a good actress but hard to tell with the over-the-top style of the whole show
put aside a dr house repeat that i had missed and a desperate housewives to watch this one i don't know exactly what plagued this movie i never thought i'd say this but i want my minutes of fame direction i can't say i recognized the stable of actors usual suspects but thought herbert marshall was a class addition and sat myself down for a good cheesy flick boy was i wrong favorite parts where the office girl makes with the keypunch and puts the cards into a sorter lol the computer i'd like someone identify the next device a before even this we dinosaurs don't have that much time to waste
tv does influence look at the surge in popularity of cappucino shops after this shallow little piece of work debuted besides real people who look as good as these people do don't have any does anyone really believe that these people can afford to live in a nice manhattan loft considering what they do for a living nbc just loves to insult the intelligence even if they're just around level i know a person who makes a year as a web designer and lives in a tiny one-bedroom apartment in manhattan that costs a month in rent like to see a show called phriends where six ugly nobodies in dead-end jobs living in a crummy neighborhood where sirens constantly wail and someone gets mugged every then the landlord jacks up the rent now that i would watch
well i watched this last night and the one thing that didn't make it completely terrible is that it was straight forward there was no beating around the bush that this kid was the anti-christ however the movie was just poorly written for example they never explained how they made the dentist incident an accident or at the end how the cop just miraculously ended up at the house in time to save the kid without the police even being called yet the death scenes were just really bad and not entertaining at all the kid they chose to play the anti-christ was boring and they really could've picked a better kid just don't waste your time watching this
is obviously just a self indulgent programme for stanley tucci to be a deep doctor unlike house he has absolutely no personality and unlike anatomy the brain surgery cases are't even interesting this programme is supposed to be set in a leading centre for neurlogical cases yet nothing interesting or exciting going on not even the so called pathetic feud between him and a rival adds anything to the show and neither do those hallucinations in the pilot there was a brief glimpse into the social life as a father snooze boring and show is a glut of medical dramas around at the moment and this does nothing to make it stand out as special
i had to compare two versions of hamlet for my shakespeare class and unfortunately i picked this version everything from the acting actors deliver most of their lines directly to the camera to the camera shots medium or close up scenery shots and very little back ground in the shots were absolutely terrible i watched this over my spring break and it is very safe to say that i feel that i was gypped out of minutes of my vacation not recommended by any stretch of the imagination
there was no characterization in this movie and really shows how much this talentless hack who directed this needs to learn his craft all his characters in this movie were so unlikable and i could care less the best point in this movie was the end credits and the hour long shower after this cause i felt so damn dirty that i wasted money on this stinking load hey and yakuza are from two different places learn something about asian culture the dog scene in this felt so tacked on and useless this dvd does prove useful i do love my new kids don't waste your cash on this crap buy hostel instead
pointless short about a bunch of half naked men slapping and punching each other it for about minutes we see this shot in black and white with tons of half-naked men running around slapping each other to the tune of dreadful music it looks interesting but no plot and violence inherent in this got disturbing also the homo eroticism in this is played up but mixing it with violence was not a good idea some people who like avant garde material might like this but i found it incomprehensible boring stupid and disturbing is the point in all this i saw it as part of a festival of gay shorts and the audience sat there in stunned silence i really wish i could go lower than
pathetic is the word bad acting pathetic script cheezy dialog and hip hop music the hell was up with that the directer of this movie acts as bad as the movie he made if someone would have taken some time and effort to rework the whole thing it may of had a chance bet the studios are still trying figure out how they could screw up up so absolute best thing about this movie was stacey asian chick wasn't too bad neither these too gals carried the whole movie if it weren't for them i would have destroyed my copy of this any of those who have not seen this yet and had a notion to don't waste your only regret it later
just say it in simple words so that even the makers of this film might have a chance to understand this is a very dumb film with an even dumber script lame animation and a story about as original as thumbtacks don't bother unless you need to find some way to entertain a group of mentally retarded adults or extremely slow children they might laugh especially if they're off their meds a special kind of insult in a film this ridiculous not only do the filmmakers apparently think that children are brainless idiots who can be entertained with claptrap that cost approximately zero effort but they don't even bother to break a sweat inserting a gag here and there that an adult might find amusing this film frankly ticked me off royally shame on you for stooping so low
i saw this movie at a drive-in in until howard the duck i considered this the worst movie i had ever seen this movie tried to combine all the genera in one comedy horror teenage angst and the hot rod that must have sired my mother the car maybe it deserves a second viewing to see if it is an accurate reflection of time
this film was shrouded in scandal for so long that it became a very sought after outrage the mystery etc it had everything to be a great piece of film-making but ultimately fails in every extent a terribly bad comedy a pathetic horror movie a lame erotic disc dvd includes a gorgeous booklet with stills interviews essays on bestiality etc as well as an extensive interview with the more-than-pretentious director for those who have heard about it but never seen it the package will seem fantastic until one actually sees the film disc contains the edited film badly translated to english but with good visual quality disc contains the cut in an awful transfer in can i say about the actual beast a hand puppet of kermit the frog would have been more effective and shocking
words fail that isn't properly this could have been great funny spoof b-movie sci-fi but sadly it was not to be rarely in the field of drama have so many competent actors struggled so vainly with such a dogs-breakfast of a script i can only endorse the previous comments go clean the bathroom in fact do anything except watch this lucy nose negatives everything apposite line this isn't going only every plastic surgeon could meet with such a fate
stella dallas with barbara stanwyck hasn't exactly aged anyone thought a semi-updated version of the story would work now is a real puzzler perhaps they thought jaunty cheerfully brash bette midler could make something out of it but this hoary script defeats her plot about a female bartender having a baby out of wedlock and years later giving the young girl over to the wealthy father so she'll have a shot at a better life can't escape tatty old-fashioned trappings and sentiment midler works best with a movie director who can control her excesses but that fails to happen here stephen collins is stolid as the man who changes her life but trini alvarado is well-cast as daughter this is what used to be referred to as a picture a wallow but it doesn't pass muster because it stays too faithful to its origins from
this one is a little better than the first one it still relies on a lot of its humor which basically keeps saying that the old bond movies were not realistic that wears thin after so many parodies the girls were more interesting in this is a tremendous amount of total gross out humor hopefully one day real comedy will come back
this movie is one of the most awful i've ever seen not only is the dialogue awful it never ends you'll think ending but not how long is it minutes i don't even know i do know that i'll never watch it again like someone took a romantic comedy took out the comedy then decided to downplay the romance leaving us with the pile of crap that managed to make its way to the screen but don't take my word for it find out for yourself how terrible this film is
i was really looking forward to watching this being that i love danny dyer and i think gillian anderson is a gifted actress the beginning was interesting i liked the relationship between the two stars it then quickly jumps to the main plot which is they get attacked by a group of strangers and dyer gets beaten extremely bad while anderson gets raped they then decide to go for some revenge sounds good right well not the story gets boring and side-tracked and certain things get really weird i won't give out any details but things happen that i for one have no desire to see i like to give all movies the benefit of the doubt and i really wanted to like this one it just didn't work out i give it a out of mainly for the acting
seldom do i give up on a movie without seeing the entire show this is particularly true when i have rented it on dvd syriana was one in which i did give up half way through i turned it off in bored movie is disjointed boring confusing and lackluster the acting was dry and without credible portrayals the general plot was good but developed in such an insipid and boring fashion that it failed to grasp my attention or interest the multiple sub plots often failed to connect to each other and seemed more like random stories than an actual connected plot too bad such a serious subject and such great actors could create such a flop i cannot imagine this movie receiving any nominations much less an award
attempt to turn jack life into a jack london adventure film isn't a bad idea certainly he led an interesting and sometimes adventurous life this film however winds up flat and unsatisfying most importantly it lacks integrity michael london has some londonesque speeches and nice to see his bearded jack receive the call of the wild after spending some quality time alone in the snowy mountains with his dog buck virginia mayo and susan hayward are both very pretty the film draws unfortunate yellow peril parallels between life and world war ii which are both strained and insulting jack london alfred santell michael susan hayward virginia mayo
don't let the premise fool was one funny movie the wasn't supposed to be a comedy the story sets you up nicely for an ending that never comes even worse the set-up is never explained you will leave the theater asking is that it i rate it a simply because there were a few brief moments of promise but the finish leaves you completely flat nicholas cage did as good a job as can be expected in the role but he had very little to work with there are odd quirks and interesting turns everywhere which had absolutely nothing to do with the movie let this one come out on video before wasting your money
this film is about a japanese woman who has an obsession with calligraphy on plot is absolutely bizarre i fail to see any sensual or erotic undertones the plot turns an ancient art form into a fetishistic pornography in addition the scenes that are filmed in hong kong are certainly portraying bad parts of hong kong such as the airport in the middle of the city poor living conditions and noise pollution throughout the whole film i keep thinking that the pillow book is insulting the japanese culture and the hong kong pillow book is a perverted yet boring film seriously stay away from it
i was very disappointed with this film i expected more of a thelma and louise female-buddy crime movie instead the women prison escapees in this flick had no sense of loyalty to one another they were an extremely vulgar pack of hyenas who beat each other up double-crossed each other and even committed lesbian rape against other women in the of being shrewed thieves who stuck together to plan their escape and find the hidden stash of money the women escapees were too selfish and vicious to trust each other for long these women weren't liberated in a positive sense they just ended up being a bunch of loose-cannons incapable of respect for themselves or each other if you like female crime caper films skip this bomb and see the great texas dynamite chase which stars claudia jennings and jocelyn jones
this film is hardly good not great at all a few memorable scenes and the unlucky choice of pairing norma jean with an actual actress jane russell has it all working for her lesser woman actress one can only wonder why this is considered being one of the highlights of her lame career
i am a huge willem dafoe fan and really sought out this film had to get a region chinese dvd of it but it is truly one of the worst that i've seen in quite a acting for dafoe is horrible dafoe and colagrande both wrote and directed this though he isn't credited as a director and they have no discernible talents for writing or directing to acting willem giada get out of the business nothing happens except a series of completely unconvincing totally without believable motivation acts by these two people just met in this house sleepy i couldn't care less expression practically never changes and the sex scenes are downright lame i actually cringed twice at one of them yuck they're definitely not the least bit erotic and yet are the only time the film isn't putting you to sleep then busy repulsing awful
this show was laughably bad the writing sucked the dialog sucked the guy who played craig couldn't act his way out of a paper sack being it was on thursday night this was definitely great to watch with some beers cool music bad acting poor writing all came together for my was a comedy i don't care what happened to any of the characters they were all boring and stupid the first five episodes were the worst since they couldn't reveal who the victim was they had to write the dialog around it which was terrible i mean the eulogy at the funeral was ridiculous actually all the scenes that occurred in the present were utterly review everything happening in present time sucked the flashback scenes only the writing dialog and acting sucked the music ruled though
ohhh the brutality ohhhhh the dying breed ohhhh the sense of loss ohhhh the prejudice jeez when are all you whiney revisionists going to stop analyzing westerns for crying out loud happens if it offends your socially engineered sensibilities then go back to the comfort of your meryl steep tedious and very tiresome waste of celluloid-particularly in light of presence nothing interesting or intriguing here unless you are obsessed with century desert dentisty may have been a little better without the constant diversion of the out-of-place mexican guy with the bad tooth a monument to the stupid ultra-left creeping sensitivity of the virtually impossible to sit through the entire film i think i'd rather have my eyes stapled open for the entire lucky series deader'n hell
is this the movie is this what indians are trying to show i think this is one more effort from a sick-minded director to turn down pakistani soldiers and in fact what we know that we are always ahead of india in every part of our only in armed is bad filmed as that of border in early director and writer just tried to overcome a shame of defeat in kargil by pakistani armed forces by creating films like thing is very there will be an encounter between pakistan and will win so mr dutta try to make some good movies instead of nonsense movies like this
in fact it never was i'm not sure why billy crystal wanted to recreate a screwball comedy what a vacuous shambles none of these people come close to a cary grant spencer tracy katherine hepburn etc and anyway audience isn't as receptive to this facile muck writing is trivial the hackneyed plot is razor thin and obvious the chemistry between the leading characters is non-existent interesting that julia roberts seems to think a reincarnation of some big star from the golden age of hollywood whenever that may be an effect she tries and fails to attain yet again with richard gere in runaway bride
boring stuff we got here his minute shorts are better than this know why because there only minutes and not minutes or how ever long this is plot is kinda eh the last half hour is alright the rest is boring and not funny =( i had my hopes up the trailer made it look funny but the pace of this movie is pretty slow and sadly not funny just plain boring klaymen running into each other and trying to make us laugh not next time re-cutting this movie and adding better scenes would do a lot of healing but for now its just not good
five minutes into this movie you realize that you have seen it all before it is boiler room it is the firm and it is the devils advocate and there are no new elements here except for the all-to-clear bill gates-allegory conpsiracies are always good stuff for movie-making but why does it have to be so extreme boiler room is a good movie because it for a while at least seems realistic in antitrust everything is wrong how realistic is it for example that your boss pay an impostor to be your girlfriend in order to make you work harder and control you i'd give it but the soundtrack is ok so
i saw this film at a pre-release screening at the writers guild theater in beverly hills as i recall the producers and director were in attendance presumably to gage our scenes evoked gales of laughter from the audience which would have been fine if it had been a comedy but it was supposed to be a horror the audience wasn't scared it seems the filmmakers were they delayed release for over a year out of curiosity i saw it again to see if they'd re-cut it as far as i can tell they hadn't it was the same lousy movie just a year almost qualifies as so bad good but slow-paced and boring
what was an exciting and fairly original series by fox has degraded down to meandering tripe during the first season dark angel was on my weekly must see list and not just because of jessica the powers-that-be over at fox decided that they needed to fine-tune the plotline within episodes of the season opener they had totally lost me as a viewer even to see jessica alba i found the new characters that were added in the second season to be too ridiculous and amateurish the new plotlines were stretching the continuity and credibility of the show too thin on one of the second season episodes they even had max sleeping and dreaming where the first season stated she biologically couldn't moral of the story one that hollywood never gets if it works don't screw with
there was nothing about this movie that i liked it was so obviously low-budget with bad lighting and camera work like blair witch project only it wasn't supposed to be that way there wasn't really much to the plot and the movie just drug on and on i actually fast-forwarded through the last of the movies but that did not help matters much it looked like it might be good from the box but i must say again nothing about this movie even resembled good no good actors the special effects were so fake the camera work was horrible and the dialogue was painfully terrible on my own personal scale i give this movie a of yikes
needed an excuse to get out of the house while paint dried left the movie after an hour to return and watch the paint don't recall ever walking out on a movie before but i really tried to stay the script was not up to the cast and just kept going and going badly come on uma thurman doing this stuff fairly lame special effects these were older characters and actors doing superficial horny lives just sort of annoying and wrong review is base only on the first hour it might have gotten better i just had to get home and see if the paint dried a darker shade than when it went on
i gave this two stars for the awesome dv shot clarity which lends to the cold and dark sterility of its character that was being generous i film fails on all accounts i can not recommend this for it is neither poetic nor blunt neither dramatic nor suspenseful neither controversial nor ordinary it is just a wretched piece of trash that no horror or exploit fan can recommend in good not watch this whoever you are please just stay away from this awful you
i have been searching for the right words to describe this film at first i was inclined to simply skip to more significant matters as the film does not rise to a level deserving i stopped puzzled as to how to describe such stuff and somewhat intrigued by the challenge presented by the question what can one say about such a film rubbish no its not rubbish rubbish can be recycled into something useful greenhouse gas no its not greenhouse gas greenhouse gases help plants grow large and i struck on not even bad a rework of the phrase not even wrong used sometimes in theoretical physics to describe a theory that is hopelessly flawed and not even worthy of correction it then georgia rule not even bad
this movie is terrible terrible one of the worst movies ever i cannot even imagine gigli being worse that this previews made us say no but then looking for something amid the dreck out there right now we decided to go ahead and give it a is not an actor an image and can look good with explosions but not even the kind bruce willis got in die hard if he stripped his shirt and ran around fighting bad guys it would be a best part was catherine o'hara always good gandolfini flops again it weren't for the sopranos he'd be washed up like he did in the hogs every scene and as others have said no character has any motivation whatsoever for their actions this movie at all costs
after the success of part another sequel was a natural move however they should have stopped it before it began alice having survived part finds herself pregnant and it seems freddy is using her unborn child to get at his victims which of course are friends strange nightmare movie very heavy on religious imagery and bad acting the special effects are good but the movie itself is not
honestly my expectations for little bush were low i was expecting a little cartoon series with lots of fun rehashed and overdone bush jokes apparently i should have lowered my expectations even writing was absolutely pathetic aside from the cheney-chicken-eating joke and some giggly-little swipes it was really boring and animation was about as sophisticated as a thirteen-year flash project disgraceful that they used product for this because capable of so much don't like bush that much and i enjoy a bush-joke as much as the next guy but this was just a half-hour swipe at the president with several painfully un-funny moments trey parker and matt stone did so much more with my yourself a favor skip lil bush and go buy a copy of the short-lived comedy my bush you'll thank me
i try to be very objective when i view a low budget movie i also apply a lower weight to independent and low budget productions versus the big budget productions i expect near flawlessness from big budget productions and their studios therefore i apply tougher criteria to the major studio releases but this movie was just a dud period the premise was terrible the main character mary gordano silverstone was unbelievable as a high school senior with an unquenchable desire to solve crimes there was not enough depth in her character or her acting that pulled you into her world also to make this movie more mysterious the lighting in certain scenes did not set the mood especially in the again another disappointing movie that i could only give three points to
someone told me that this was one of the best adult movies to date i have since discredited everything told to me by this individual after seeing this movie just terrible without going into lengthy descriptions of the various scenes take my word for it the sex scenes are uninteresting at best jenna in normal street clothes in the beginning was the highlight of the film does look good but all downhill from there
i'll be honest the only reason i watched this one on tv is that in the imdb bottom and right now i'm wondering if the hour and a half of my life really was worth another check on that same damme is luc deveraux who finds himself on a huge fight with the universal soldiers after the main computer pulled a hal to defend itself and yes after all the obligate explosions shoot-outs and chases he is the last one standing combined with terrible acting and a bit of a boring set-up it makes sure place in the infamous list is for the idiots like me who want to watch that full list
how in the name of all holy did this film ever get distribution it looks as if it has been shot on mobile phone and takes the screaming girl victim scenario to whole new depths they literally scream for the full minutes of the movie and all they do there is no plot no tension no characters and not a lot of acting just screaming and more gave up after fifteen minutes and fast-wound through it to see if anything happened it doesn't except for screaming of course odlly enough the act of going through it on fast forward highlights another problem there is no camera-work to speak of every shot looks like every other shot middle distance one angle dull dull not so bad good just plain bad
this documentary is founded on sponge cake as soon as you put any real evidence on it the integrity slowly sinks into a big pile of crap for example bart sibrel claims they must have had multiple lighting sources because the shadows appear to be crossing if this were the case wouldn't there be two or more shadows for each object when apollo went through the van allan radiation belts they spent there not the claimed in the documentary and they received a dose of radiation more equivalent to that of an an x do some research learn what really happened don't let this pile of crap of a documentary mold your opinion of what really happened
the sun should set on this movie goes on forever isn't usually a bad thing the english patient list but is so tedious the aging of the actors is unbelievable and so is the drawn-out never-ending story line which really seems to go short a waste of talent and film
poorly written conspiracy about the possibility that aids was introduced to the public by the government wlaschiha plays a gay researcher looking for within this foggy plot would be hard for anyone to find despite the cinematography itself being commendable the camera hungers for characters of true depth instead of the shallow amateur acting it unfortunately has to convey grade
in i liked it then it became very stupid it suggests that kids are brainless it insults children cartoon network used to be great one of the shows i liked was hamtaro it did manage to be interesting and imaginative in its approach to children programming the show home for imaginary friends is like putting spoons of sugar in your sprite it seems as if television producers are only interested in making money rather than engaging the imaginations of children and making money lately my children are tuning in to the old shows to find something interesting to watch perhaps in the absence of originality for television to look to its past and recycle programing from days gone by
like some of the other folks who have reviewed this film i was also waxing nostalgic about i had the misfortune to actually watch it again alas my childhood memories of this film were completely untrustworthy and the perils of pauline is now revealed to be an embarrassing exercise in banal racist and plain boring film-making even the presence of old pros edward everett horton and terry-thomas can't overcome a rancid screenplay a horrible theme song and some wretched special effects in addition the stereotypical depictions of african and arab characters make for painful viewing especially considering this was produced in the immediate wake of the civil rights movement michael original psychotronic encyclopedia reports that the perils of pauline was originally produced for television but inexplicably ended up getting a theatrical release judging from the results that is a completely believable baffling scenario
this was among the stupidest and preachiest of the anti-nuke films out of the idea that a kid and a basketball star could change the world is pretty far-fetched given how many peace marches and celebrity protests there were and the idea that the soviet union would agree to a total nuclear disarmament because some apparatchik kids learned of a silent protest in the west is ended the cold war tough dare i say reaganesque stance and the internal failures of socialism it was not the peace marches the die-ins or films like amazing grace chuck miracle mile or testament
this movie was packed pull of endless surprises just when you thought it couldn't get worse they added more joints and more pink fuzzy-lined vans with raunchy sex scenes as you can guess i was a victim of the original version we were tricked into watching it thinking it was supervan the host box which promised lasars jail breaks and much more who would have thought a dollar store christmas present could have been so much fun
what were they thinking at cannes one of the most irritating films of all time every detail of this film no matter how meaningless was shown if i had to watch her put on those boots one more time i think i would have shouted if the point of this film was to show how pathetic a life rosetta had then it was covered within the first fifteen minutes of the movie and then the credits should have been running but no we had to see countless redundant scenes over and over the whole thing was filled with un-likeable and unsympathetic characters they deserved the misery that was rosetta and to think i passed up tumbleweeds to see this over-hyped film of boredom it was like watching grass grow only that is more exciting
i have no idea what the producers of the shield were trying to do but the result speaks for itself the shield is practically the performances on the shield are reality the show is so badly put together that you can't even really see the performances for instance the editing cuts away from reaction shots before they've had their full don't know what intellectual rationale there is for that but it robs the show of all emotional give the shield one point for ambition in its subject matter but pretty much all i can give a shame to see a number of talented performer waste their gift on something so strangely badly filmed
a poorly written script with no likeable characters as for it being a comedy i forgot to laugh about conceited friends who scam to get women in too bed with them sex scenes and another is semi-discustingly sometimes also scams but mainly is considered as being the guy who masterbates the friends separately meet and fall for the same woman peet somehow this is done without really any romance the guys stop being friends as they separately dated her she scammed them out of their friendship because they scammed women a bad movie
we know that firefighters and rescue workers are heroes an id√©e re√ßue few would challenge friends and family of these and others who perished in the attacks on the world trade center might well be moved by this vapid play turned film a sweet earnest though tongue-tied fireman recalls what he can of lost colleagues to a benumbed journalist who converts his fragments into a eulogy they ponder the results he mumbles some more she composes another eulogy etc dreadful events that provoked the need for several thousand eulogies is overwhelmingly sad but this plodding insipid dramatization is distressingly boring
as a single woman over i found this film extremely insulting and demeaning to single women over not to mention every other woman of any age it was a sad pathetic attempt by a man to write and direct a chick flick and it failed miserably andy mcdowell isn't much of an actress to begin with but given the non-existent plot hate to even refer to it as a plot in this she didn't have a chance there was no character development no reason to feel for any of the characters and no attempt to make the film in any way realistic or believable and then the obligatory male-fantasy of an attractive straight woman suddenly deciding to give lesbianism a try only do i wish i could get my money back for the dvd rental i also want those minutes of my life back what a ripoff
the most difficult thing about this movie is to say anything positive about it the characters were stereotypical white-trash the plot was stunted from the beginning and the worst feature of this movie was that the nudity was so blatantly from body doubles it was funny regretfully that was the only funny thing in the movie ms jenkins would be better served if in the future she would refrain from using her life-story to entertain people it was simply that bad the one positive aspect of this movie has nothing to do with the lack-of-quality of the film is that my brother shelled out the money for this stinker
superdome is one of those movies that makes you wonder why it was made the whole plot concerns someone trying to sabotage the superbowl and all the attempts made to stop them how tom selleck and donna mills careers managed to survive this is beyond me however the most frustrating thing about it was there was no football in it at all avoid this one if possible
and i never thought a movie deserved to be awarded a but this one is honestly the worst movie i've ever watched my wife picked it up because of the cast but the storyline right since the dvd box seemed quite predictable it is not a mystery nor a juvenile-catching film it does not include any sensuality if what the title could remotely have suggest any of you this is just a total no-no don't waste your time or money unless you feel like watching a bunch of youngsters in a as-grown-up kind of gothic setting where a killer is going after them nothing new nothing interesting nothing worth watching max makowski makes the worst of nick stahl
one of the most boring slashers ever if you can even call it that i wouldn't watch this if it even ended up being some kind of porno movie which it completely resembles the fact that you're watching a small group of middle-aged people in the woods is really unbearable they made these kinds of movies for teens so who were they really aiming for when they made this sleep-fest my favorite part of this movie is the cover art and the only reason i chose to seek out this movie which happened to be part of a suspense classics movie pack and after seeing the other movies in this pack you'll realize that it belongs nowhere else so if you're in the mood for a decent slasher in the woods i recommend just before dawn and the final terror
movie starts out as an ordinary comic-hero-movie about the boy who is picked on has no parents and is madly in love with the schools girl nothing surprises in the movie there is nothing that you guess coming in the movie toby mcguire shows us that either he is no good actor or that no actor in the world can save a script like this one maybe kids around the age of ten can enjoy the film but it is a bit violent for the youngest you get away from thinking of movies like x-men batman and spawn all of those titles are better i almost walked out the last minutes one thing that could have been good though was the computeranimation but not even that is anything to put in the christmas-tree so my recomendation see this film even if you get paid for it
said a couple exiting the movie theater just as i was entering to watch this hmm not a good sign but who knows different strokes for different folks after all well nope they were being kind godard has released work that is passionate entertaining of outsiders sometimes both life to live this is just dull intellectualism that grates on the nerves pretty quickly during my showing literally half of the audience had walked out by the end of the film if only i had been so wise
having read another review i thought this movie would actually be good i do enjoy the b movies but this couldn't even be classed as such the photography is probably the only half-way decent thing in the movie but the editing left much to be desired it was very choppy and staccato whoever chose the music and sound did a terrible job the music was awful specially anything atmospheric or scene setting if the acting had been better they could have pulled the movie off unfortunately i've seen better acting in porn flicks if you want to see a b vampire movie check out blood ties you'll be much more entertained
a mercilessly corny and painfully unfunny attempt to transplant the character of sheriff bart from mel brooks blazing saddles into his own weekly sitcom this is really as bad as some people say it laugh-track only serves to remind the unamused viewer what all in this supposed comedy is intended to be a joke and just how desperate for laughs it really it is somewhat interesting to see louis gossett jr trying his best to impersonate cleavon little his embarrassment shows through in every scene he was much funnier in the hbo movie el diablo than he was here in this slab of the best and funniest thing about black bart is the name of his horse
i saw one of the stage performances in denver and have never been less impressed the word vagina says it all a body part nothing shocking here i could say to my doctor my left arm has been hurting a bit after tennis or my vagina hurts after cycling with equal or more social commentary it could be the tricep monologues for all the entertainment or radical comment i heard the monologues were dull but delivered with drama the topics were outdated and i was alternately bored and annoyed once i think i laughed but apparently it wasn't when i was supposed to surely this isn't really a hit oh and spoilers there was a lesbian oh wait maybe not come to think of it and inappropriate fondling and a crack mama that about covers it
a romanticised and thoroughly false vision of unemployment from a middle class artist with a comfortable upbringing it is clear that the writer-director never suffered unemployment directly and certainly has no personal experience of it if you had to believe this absolutely ridiculous story unemployed men of all ages behave like teenagers have no anger no fear no frustration etc all the characters live trough the day by carrying pranks boyish jokes they do never look for work the do almost never experience rejection or anguish etc living on the dole is just about like a summer vacation from school ridiculous specially if you compare it with contemporary masterpieces from the likes of ken loach etc
valentine is a horrible movie this is what i thought of very bad katherine heigl can not act the weren't much the story was okay but it could have been more developed this movie had the potential to be a great movie but it yes some of the music was pretty not very original the name prescott recognize line don't see valentine a really stupid
this barely watchable film was a bit of an ordeal to sit through none of the segments are good but at least the first one was mildly amusing and the middle one was somewhat imaginative the final one was just plain brutal and after sitting through two weak comedic shorts the third one was truly painful to watch even by the low standards of a national lampoon movie this one seemed especially boring and joyless
horrible i see many user comments on how great this show is it truly is a wanna-be-friends made in taiwan knockoff the jokes are lame the plot is ridiculous the actors are obviously struggling to be funny and are probably cringing when they hit those awful punchlines you can call them that the bulk of the other users who have commented are obviously from another planet at least another continent there are obviously reasons that tv companies cancel none of then are when shows are doing well make sense anyway steer clear even if it is raining and there is absolutely nothing else on this planet to stand in the rain instead more fun
in an interview david duchovny said he hasn't been able to watch even the first hour of this film and neither should you the scene where he asks the owner of a house where a murder was committed if he can look around change the name he gives and he could had lifted his performance from just about any episode of the x-files on autopilot for the whole film brad pitt overacts appallingly
tons of good-looking women in this flick but alas this movie is nudity-free grrrrrrrrrr strike one story in this film takes place in then why the hell are the main characters driving a kia sportage hello continuity you might know this movie was released in stereoscopic and it is the most hideous effect i have ever seen i'm not sure if someone botched the job on this but there was no just double-vision blurs i didn't have the same problem with this other movies hunting season and camp blood sure the in those ones sucked too but with them i could see a semblance of thing is a big ball of whoever that women was who played the daughter of the ear-eating dame yum i'd like to see more of her in movies as well looks like janet margolin at a young age
this film has it all the deft camera work reminiscent of martin scorcese or oliver stone the tight acting of heat the explosive action of a jerry bruckheimer movie the witty dialogue of a tarantino script and the epic feel of say the judge reinhold character displays a fiery temperememt yet also shows real emotional depth and intensity his performance reminds me of robert de portrayal of jake la motta in raging action scenes are truly breathtaking not since bullit has a movie depicted such high octane yet stylish car scenes the special effects push the boundries of technology and filmmaking to their limits independance day set the standard that this movie clearly has matched and greatly great acting from its a list cast an oscars night party invitation list classy locations gripping action and a tight script
ok my girlfriend and i rented the dvd and about minutes into the movie we'd exchanged a lot of ehhh what is this movie about and more importantly do i care to find out what it ends with glances and decided we either needed drugs to keep us interested in the plot or just end the pain right there and then and watch something else we opted for the liked but i'm a cheerleader a lot but mango kiss is too silly and surreal for my taste sorry i definitely prefer better than chocolate fucking √•m√•l goldfish memory and
oh dear i was so disappointed that this movie was just a rip-off of ringu well i guess the made their version of it as well but at least it was an outright remake so so sad i very much enjoy watching filipino movies and know some great things can come out of such a little country so i can't believe this had to happen claudine and kris are such big names there surprised they would be affiliated with plagiarism to any aspiring movie makers out there in the philippines you do not have to stoop this low to make money there are many movie buffs that are watching the movies filipinos put out and enjoying them
now i don't hate cheap movies i just don't see why you should waste any money for a movie you could shoot with your camcorder if i rent a movie i want it to be a movie not a bunch of people thinking it would be a good idea to waste some minidv i hate this one so much because the guy in the video store said it was great and it wasn't maybe i hate it because cheap has the dumbest plot ever the most unrealistic characters ever and the really really really worst showdown in the history of films ever even tom savini can't save this one is a complete waste of time
okay this movie in rules it is without question one of the most technically inept pieces of cinema ever made absolutely terrible but you gotta see it rent this with your buddies and come up with a drinking game or just have fun hilarious and the behind-the-scenes featurette proves it you can do anything with paper plates and finger paint awesome okay rent it just for this one scene two characters are actually walking in place for about minutes in a shot the director the commentary says yeah the tracking was so smooth it looks like they're yeah right man they are totally walking in place so funny
going into this i was expecting anything really good but after the damage this inflexed on me i'm just happy to think strait hard to think what the ha this was a good movie the stories and i use the world loosely are incoherent and do make any sense at all there just stupid things that happen at random the acting if can be called acting is horrible i've seen batter acting in toy ads i know a low-budget video-bin garbages but still even not like they tried will after stetting thought it i feel very sleepy and still do i'm going to go lie do not atemp to drive walk read or do any after watching chillers other side affectts may enguled lose of any or all metal funkions
i don't what that other review was talking about this definitely isn't a bimbo movie in fact i don't think there was one decent looking girl in it no just cheesy poorly-done ed wood-style science fiction schlock and bad i can't even begin to tell you how bad it is i saw it late at night on cable and i was in shock the fact that this movie was ever released is an insult to us all the actors were either friends of the producer or mentally retarded the special effects are a joke and the pace is insanely slow to me though the music tops it all a monkey could write a better theme with a toy xylophone do not rent this thing but if you ever see it on cable watch it you'll be amazed at how bad a movie can be
seriously i absolutely love these old movies and their simplicity but i just watched this for the first time last night and it easily slotted itself into my bottom five of all time was this supposed to be about the love story or the zombies this movie was so bad that after it mercifully ended all i could do is laugh at how ridiculously bad it really was thankfully i'm too anal to turn a movie off without seeing the entire thing or i wouldn't be able to brag about watching this all the way through in one sitting i like to think something positive can be said about anything in life so in keeping with that theory i will acknowledge this most positive asset it was very short for a full length film
dear friends and guess if one teen wants to become biblical with another teen then their eternal damnation just remember kids birth control doesn't mean oral sex i don't care what the honor student says on the other hand even if the aid quotes himself as a bit of a romantic guy still only hitting on a high school girl if she was my sister i'd eat this guys than that i found out that mongolians don't kiss the same way the french do and that baseball players named zoo like delicate think i'd almost rather watch richie rich one more time than suffer the indignity of this slip slap slop thank you and good night
may contain my huge problem with this movie is how totally self-centered and self consumed the adulteress wife is after having a one night stand with a slimy psycho she is being stalked by him he calls her constantly and threatens her and even sends a video of their night together he is obviously crazy and very dangerous the problem is she only thinks he is dangerous to her exposing her secret not for one second did she ever have one thought of concern for her husband did she even for a moment think of him possibly being in danger from this psychotic as soon as she realized how mental he was she should have warned her husband no matter what the consequences maybe there wouldn't have been a movie then but there really wasn't one anyway so the difference
this is the sort of thing that only now thrills the film eggheads after all flex crush will have you know that real men don't watch anything by truffaut might have been interesting if truffaut had anything to here the camera-as-voyeur motif was nothing new have we all forgotten de bicycle thief or anything by all we get is the extended metaphor of the juvenile as truffaut who spends all his free time screwing up his eyes at the movies who wrecks schoolroom discipline gets accused of many petty thefts and ultimately escapes societal confines to make his own movie there done that too many times for this to matter
we went into this movie because my husband had enjoyed the original version of favourite martian we had our year old daughter with us she wanted to leave halfway through the movie which was fine with both her parents the parts we did see were only occasionally humorous mostly either too silly or gross i would expect that this movie might appeal to kids between if that definitely not suited for younger children from what i've heard the original series was by far superior and if you are going to relive the past you'll probably be disappointed
yep this is definatly up there with some of the worst of the mstifyed movies but i have definately seen worse think gremlins rated r well anyway i met rick sloane at some sci-fi convention that amazingly he was lecturing at it was one of those really low budget conventions where everything goes an everyone brought in something you want to see crap you should have of seen what some friends and i brought seemed like a very nice guy he was very cool about my questions and comments on hobgoblins and he even told me not to take it seriously and said he loved the in all rick sloane knew what he was doing and i think was meant to bad like mars attacks so i guess i'm standing up for this movie and giving it a and betraying all my fellow msties sorry guys
this movie features a gorgeous brunette named danielle petty she has stunning green eyes and is in the first few scenes and the last scene she is the only thing about this movie that is not repulsive she may not have a future as an actress because this kind of movie is the kind of offensive disaster that kills movie itself has absolutely nothing to recommend it it is not a good horror film or a good fake journalistic report or remotely well done there is no skill apparent in production it is like a bad student film the horrific elements do not make you sick it is the fact that it is so poorly done that makes you sick i would give this movie zero stars if i could
the starring reed hadley with an all-star guest cast the film begins with an accidental kidnapping which leads to one thing and another which doesn't really indicate the main story which is a big house prison break story the story is very improbable to say the least like a tv show only more violent the the cast is a trip picture this ralph meeker is sent to prison his cell-mates are the following criminals broderick crawford lon chaney jr charles bronson a muscle magazine and william talman a detective magazine honest you should know that an early scene reveals what happens to the missing boy answering the ending voiceover if you don't want to have that hanging don't miss the opening scenes between the iceman and the boy votrian doing well as a runaway asthmatic big house howard w koch broderick crawford ralph meeker reed hadley
disjointed unclear bad screenplay poor photography and in all very obviously an ill-conceived first effort at commercial film-making by the good people at pictures has had great success in the past by helping to bring china cry the story of nora lam to the big screen but the omega code is an unfortunate miscue as a christian who supports tbn and a lot of its programming and who loved china cry i still find it impossible to recommend this film to anyone they do much good with their ministry but this isn't an example of it don't waste your rent china cry instead
absolutely one of the worst movies i have ever seen the acting the dialog the manuscript the sound the lighting the plot line i actually can't say anything positive about this although i enjoy swedish movies the fighting scenes are so ridiculous that impossible to take it seriously and when the lead character just happens to loose his shirt while dodging bullets in a strip bar i'm not sure if supposed to be a joke or if someone really thinks these are ingredients in a good film regina lund is the only half descent actor but she disappears in a flood of laughable pronunciations and unbelievable reactions it leaves you horrified that someone actually spent time and money on something like this
the only redemption was the small part by larry miller it seemed that the movie was trying too hard to be something about mary but i didn't even like that movie and it still fell short of those standards the actor who plays paul was great but selma blair is stuck in the stupidity of her cruel intentions character james brolin was great but father seemed like he was trying too hard to be the randy quaid character from the national vacation movies
what a crappy movie the worst of the worst this movie is as entertaining as a dead slug no-talent-what-so-ever-actors stupid plot who wrote this script was there ever a script for this goofy movie or did the director just accidentally press the record-button on his camera and then decided to make the film up as they went along is this meant to be a kids movie or a comedy or what my friends younger brother is in the grade and him and his classmates just did an amateur-movie for their school-project which outdid this geeky movie this is by far the worst film i have seen in my life there is just no excuse for this flick
wow this movie was so horrible i'm so glad i didn't have to pay money to see this horrible movie it was like a history nut went on a coke binge the previews of it made it look decent but it was really bad i will say the idea sounded decent but come on it was really really bad if u sat down and thought about it you would also realize it was unrealistic come on back in the day u think they had all that stuff to work with it wasn't like ben franklin sat down one day and made a damn riddle it was completely ridiculous and it you want to see a bad movie then by all means go see this one all and all horrible movie it might actually be on my top worst films i've ever seen
this is what you would get if you allowed a year old american to write a story of a moon trip absolute garbage with no redeeming qualities maybe it held some fascination in the dept but as a narrative and entertaining animation it held nothing to make wasting an hour and a half worth while save your time and money and watch bolt not enough lines yet i feel that sums it up well i agree with an above review this is like a cold-war propaganda story maybe it would have been more interesting if they had made it about the flies uncovering the hoax of the moon landing or if the flies had died in the first minute btw why were all the main character flies deformed not one had the full compliment of limbs
poor performances by sinatra martin and hyer grossly underdeveloped supporting characters annoying talky with no real plot ending leaves you flatter than a pancake with more loose ends than you could tie up in four sequels is if you even cared about these wooden characters maclaine is the only real asset that penultimate sequence in which the chicago hood searches for the sinatra character is laughable the music in that sequence also is poor and in the final scene when character removes his hat for the woman he called a pig almost made me go outside and find a stone to throw through my television screen
this movie had mediocrity laziness and thoughtlessness written all over it if you are going to do a movie about vampires that has been done thousands of times already then you better do a damn good job i'll be the first to say that this movie just did not cut it some movies just fail to break the mold of the lets do something forbidden and forsaken for the sake of fun because all the stories are just lies clich√© this one sadly was no different and like all scary movies once you venture down that road there is no going the ending how do the heroes do the same job over and over throughout the movie but then mysteriously they get wrapped up in the moment and cannot do the job in the end the ending was very anti-climatic and spelled part which i will never watch terrible movie
and i actually gave it a zero on my personal scale i have been attending movies since and have seen well over in the theater don't rate movies that i see only on tv this is the only movie i have ever rated wife and i took our four children aged and and even the kids thought it was terrible in fact it was my daughter who alerted me to this site that the movie was getting an overall rating of animation of the dinosaurs looked amateurish at the time is even worse in retrospect the acting by sean young is atrocious and the story line is simply
i was really looking forward to this movie based on the previews and press it received but after viewing it i was terribly disappointed slums is a totally unfunny film mixed with a todd solondz type of disturbing family reality sans brand of humor the story drags along and each scene is worse than the last maybe i missed the point but if this film is an example of every growing up experience i am glad to be a man
up until this new season i have been a big little mosque fan however the new season had absolutely ruined new christian vicar has destroyed the entire intent of the show it has always been about living together to overcome prejudice the new vicar ruins that premise and shows christians in a very bad am neither christian or muslim but loved watching the show and seeing the camaraderie between amar and the reverend not any cancel it and be done with it not worth watching any might still be saved but a lot of change would need to be back the old format
i couldn't relate to this film it failed to engage me either intellectually emotionally or aesthetically the dialogue was very dense and uninvolving i couldn't connect with and hence care about any of the characters and i'm finding it hard to find much positive to say about read that to understand it properly one needs to be familiar with some of the more obscure aspects of catholic theology i'll admit that as an atheist i probably am unfamiliar with many of the finer details of catholicism but i have also seen many films dealing with religious issues that have touched me because their themes are still universal to the human condition and don't rely on specialised knowledge or beliefs
dreck about three beautiful women in california who go to cover some festival something all the hotels are booked so they have to spend the night in a creepy old house what they don't know is that there is a creepy inhabitant there who likes to boring pointless utterly stupid horror film bach and her two buddies are certainly beautiful but the movie itself is dull dull dull bach and her friends are no faces are blank all the way through the final revelation is laughably predictable and no blood or gore to keep you interested along the way there is some expected gratuitous female nudity but not enough to save this boring pointless and unknown good reason a all the way
miscasting happens susannah yorke is a luminous young jane eyre and her performance is impeccable however edward rochester is supposed to be white-haired george c scott looks and behaves like an arthritic deceased uncle is in better shape he creaks and snarls obnoxious and grim he looks like an ax-murderer who has sent his ax out to be sharpened we're not surprised he keeps a wife caged in the attic the great love story looks like a sado-masochistic nightmare there is enough darkness in the novel but rochester is relatively young athletic powerful and charming when he chooses to be he has a fine speaking and singing voice a good mind and a conscience that he unsuccessfully attempts to stifle
crude some times crass to me the summation of madhur latest work page he has no point of view just shallow funny digs at stereotypes what is the movie about is it about reporting a clan of people called page types who are so busy socializing and progressing their profiles in life that they have no time for anything else and you are either in it or out of it is it that there is no press at all to report everyday incidents madhur bhandarkar forgets that there is a main newspaper and page is just a supplement perhaps an entertainer for checking out who and what don't mix the two and then there is power play that would happen in every walk of life so what have you told at the end of it all nothing just a few crude jokes strung together in an otherwise direction less movie
this film is regarded by some as a classic i've no idea why it is terrible to the point of being laughable the only saving grace with this movie are the delivery of cheesy lines that are so toe curlingly embarrassing that you have no choice but to laugh at are a couple of good songs and good choreography in this film but so what there is no plot it is set in a theatre with no change of scenery and michael douglas is as depressing as ever my brother once forced me to watch this film because he said i wouldn't believe how bad a film can get he was with a film this dreadful i would recommend that people shouldn't watch it but in this case i think people should as it will put every other bad film you've seen in perspective
unfortunately the only spoiler in this review is that nothing to spoil about that if b mattei had never done any master piece he use to do his job with a bit of humor and craziness that made him a fun eurotrash director but for the last years he seemed to have lost film is just empty nothing at all to wake us up from the deep sleep you sink into after the first sex no suppose to be about actors no dialogs just as bad as an even worse than his last cannibals and zombies rest in peace bruno you will stay in our minds forever anyway thanks to such unforgettable gems l'altro cruel jaws and few except if you want to see b mattei possessed by jess new film pass on this if you don't know this nice career track down his old films and have fun
i don't even know where to begin on this one all about the family that has to be the worst line of dialogue ever heard in a horror movie although this couldn't be a horror movie even if it tried ugh and i know that owen wilson is a better actor he needs to stop playing the token guy who dies in every action movie armageddon after all the man did co-write bottle rocket and rushmore he does have some talent also lily taylor should stick to indie films she has no place here finally catherine zeta-jones should become a porn star no room in legitimate acting for her i'm serious one of the worst movies i've ever seen ever
i like jane austin novels i love pride and prejudice and sense and sensibility books and movies and i'm half way through mansfield park but i couldn't stand emma i gave up on the book after chapters and by the end of the movie i couldn't care less about emma she didn't seem to change at all maybe it was paltrows acting as excellent in or my lack of interest for the movie dunno costumes are nice but the dancing was clumsy compared to pride and prejudice dancing by colin firth and jennifer gave it a basically for the fact knightly is bloody gorgeous and although it as a rather patchy performance for ewan mcgregor i liked his singing
this is one of those so bad it is good films that you always hear about but never see unlike troma films which are deliberately bad and campy i am not amused this one is pure with features such as a supposedly super-lethal killer robot that prances about like one of the solid gold dancers on an acid trip and a magical first mate that calls down lightning and transforms into the good witch of the east the fact that it takes itself seriously pushes it so far over the edge of bad that makes it full circle around back to enough because of that
what an awful show science fiction fans seem to watch anything anymore regardless of quality it shocks me that something exceptional like firefly lasts one season while garbage like the battlestar galactica remake spawns a spin off this spin off is pitiful in every aspect of the show the acting is juvenile and uninspired the characters are cardboard clich√©s of everything that has ever been in a bad sci-fi series the story is bad the dialog is worse than a prime time soap opera the direction is shoddy and the sets are awful caprica is a waste of film a waste of time and a waste of effort this is one spin off that should have never been made
it at all you have seen when harry met sally then avoid this one it will not only make you bang your head on the table as why can't bollywood even make a good remake but also annoy you with the so called funny moments in it the charm of the movie is missing ranee looks terrible saif tries to act like he is one hell of an actor the plots that have been picked up from the original don't look effective either the part where both of them bring their friends along and they hit a note it just doesn't look appealing what can be more disastrous you wanna waste some money this is what you can get otherwise put some more bucks and watch the original its too good to miss
imagine the worst skits from saturday night live and mad tv in one minute movie now imagine that all the humor in those bad skits is removed and replaced with stupidity now imagine something times now go see the underground comedy movie that vision you just had will seem like the funniest thing ever ucm is the single worst movie i've ever seen there were a few cheap few but it was lame even if the intent of the movie was to be lame it was too lame to be only reason i'm not angry for wasting my time watching this was someone else i know bought it he wasted his money vince offer hasn't written or directed anything else and no surprise why
i'm not a huge star trek fan but i was looking forward to this i was intrigued by the pre-hype descriptions of the enterprise its cramped-submarine styling and rough-edged technology compared to the treks we are used didn't see anything all that interesting in this pilot i found the plot to be convoluted and will admit that i did like some of the character development the depictions of the humans as an adolescent species ready to outgrow their britches was that vulcan babe had one hell of an incredible i don't think i'm going to get hooked on this
drew barrymore keeps seeing her alter-ego all over town and really starting to become a pain in the dee rents a flat from a hack writer her encounters with the other drew become more frequent writer-dude feels that his responsibility to snap the real drew out of her stupor so he does what he can to help including seducing her as soon as he has some free time not very interesting and even less scary but drew is sexy as usual especially when she gives a group of rude construction workers the finger yeah drew hot scene just might be where drew stabs her real-life mom jaid with a big kitchen knife hmmm and how was your day
only one thing i need to say about this movie the scene where shaq is in a musical number with francis character about wanting to be a genie never see this movie the story is horrible the acting is terrible shaq and i'd rather see capra in free willy horrible twice before ever seeing this movie
once upon a time there was a science fiction author named h beam piper who wrote a classic book named little fuzzy which was about a man discovering a race of adorable little fuzzy humanoids on another planet mr piper died in but hollywood and many of authors starting looting his grave before his cadaver got cold this is the book where they got the idea for ewoks is such a blatant ripoff of little fuzzy i can wonder why i'm the only ever don't take my word for it a link to project guntenberg where you can download a copy of little fuzzy for free
ultimately too silly and pointless yes there is the gilded cage metaphor but probably most kids would miss that forgettable is as we have come to expect super-real the plot-line could best be described as thin but tenacious although the ending seemed arbitrary to sewer underworld is a suitably disgusting reflection of the world above and somehow wealth and money seem to count for a lot there too oh yes and a romantic interest with the female being the smarter more savvy and go-getting of the pair this in itself is rapidly becoming a tiresome stereotype probably your kids will love it though
i read in the papers that was broke so no wonder he would take parts in low budget projects like the is just the next action star to join a growing penniless action stars of the here he stars the lead in a cheap action flick which was shot in we are supposed to believe that the location is london like only a complete moron would buy story is the one of other movies retired special forces good guy gets hired by the government again to do a wet after that government wants to get rid of good guy gets away after killing bad guys that a spoiler guess not the star of the movie the little girl bennett outperforms everybody else of the star is for her plus one star for eye candy lena headey makes stars only for die hard snipes
i have been known to fall asleep during films but this is usually due to a combination of things including really tired being warm and comfortable on the sette and having just eaten a lot however on this occasion i fell asleep because the film was rubbish the plot development was constant constantly slow and boring things seemed to happen but with no explanation of what was causing them or why i admit i may have missed part of the film but i watched the majority of it and everything just seemed to happen of its own accord without any real concern for anything else i cant recommend this film at all
i couldn't wait to put this movie in my dvd player when i rented it then after i started it i couldn't wait to get it out of my dvd player actually i watched all of the movie my wife and i kept waiting and waiting for something funny to happen but nothing funny ever does the box read like the it would be really funny the premise of the movie sound good ben stiller is funny jack black is funny how could this movie miss does miss this is the unfunniest comedy i have ever watched nobody i have talked with thought it was even slightly funny it is just a really lame movie trust me avoide it
my god was this the run lola run adaptation of persuasion it was horrible bad enough that the screenwriter i use the term very loosely cut and pasted dialogue from one character onto another often completely out of context and to rush the story along but anne elliott running from location to location in pursuit of wentworth near the end of the piece was an abomination austen must be spinning in her grave no respectable young woman would have acted in such an atrocious fashion and the actress that played mary horrors needless to say if the rest of the austen remakes are this bad they will be turning off a new generation of you want to see an impeccable version of this wonderful novel get the roger michell directed version starring amanda root expressions alone can speak volumes and ciaran hinds it is superb
i don't think i've ever been so bowled over by the sheer absurdity of a movie in my entire life as i was when i walked out of this piece of crap nothing in it makes any sense none of it is clever or well thought out out of lack of truly suspenseful moments they repeatedly use that total cop-out trick where you build up the music before the character does something like open a door or push aside a curtain and then there thats ok to do once maybe but i counted three times there are things thrown in for no apparent reason characters half-formed story lines the characters weren't well developed at all the ending was bad bad bad bad everything every component of this film is terrible and i'm just here to warn you all of that
i rented this movie because it falls under the genres of romance and western with some grand canyon scenery thrown in but if you're expecting a typical wholesome romantic western forget it this movie is pure trash the romance is between a young girl who has not even gone through puberty and a middle-aged man the child is also lusted after by other leering men fonda is portrayed as being virtuous by trying to resist his attraction to brooke shields and her character is mostly the one that pursues the relationship he tries to shoo her off at first but eventually he gives in and they drive off as a happy loving couple don't see how this movie could appeal to anyone except pedophiles
considering the potential this move had the reality was disappointing while always nice to see jennifer aniston in a movie even that couldn't turn this around most of the action was predictable the jokes were flat to mildly amusing and the characters were not very interesting i wanted to like this film but it just never happened ben stiller was hilarious in something about mary here it looks like just going thru the motions if they have to lift plot points from friends they should have known something was wrong the toilet humor should have stayed in the closet first dates instead
i'm a big fan of the old westerns and do not believe that hollywood is capable of capturing its old glory but not even ronda fleming and stewart granger can help this movie which carries nearly all the trite characteristics of westerns of the reformed gunfighter turned good guy fallen but virtuous woman bigoted townspeople who must turn to gunfighter for salvation etc i can't help but notice the last names of the writer and young actor who plays son any nepotism there i've seen better acting in high school plays chill wills plays a cartoon characterization of chill wills have i reached the words yet
this is just a case of a previously worthless island changed into something worthwhile jesus christ people lets throw a big fit over islanders big is just a case of a previously worthless island changed into something worthwhile jesus christ people lets throw a big fit over islanders big is just a case of a previously worthless island changed into something worthwhile jesus christ people lets throw a big fit over islanders big is just a case of a previously worthless island changed into something worthwhile jesus christ people lets throw a big fit over islanders big deal
this has to be one of the worst films i have ever seen without a doubt the only thing interesting in this film is the cameo appearances from some great genre directors and king himself the film has a great premise but falls apart about minutes into the story i did like madchen amick in this film and think she could have a very good career in film
since i had loved the inspector gadget cartoon in the i went to see this movie i wasted my money the plot was very thin also the movie could not keep me interested for long i was glad it was you want to see inspector gadget watch the cartoon instead it was much better than the movie
this movie should be nominated for a new genre complete mess except for a few chuckles and one or two scenes of gore this movie is a complete waste of time calling it campy doesn't even cut it campy implies fun which this movie was not you spend the first half of the movie thinking its got to get better right in fairness it does at the very end when its finally explained who the team are and what they want but by then you hardly care anymore because you've spend the entire second half of the movie wondering exactly what did mr onorati ms pacula do to tick someone off this badly to be stuck in such a horrible
don't get me wrong dan jansen was a great speed skater if there was one guy who deserved his gold medal at the olympics it was how can it be possible that bill corcoran has made such a bad movie about the incredible dan jansen story because the real dan jansen story is truly incredible especially when you look at this movie through the eyes of a sportsman everything is wrong the way matt keeslar and the other actors skate their technique the dimensions of the speedskating oval it is all on you bill corcoran dan jansen deserves better a lot out of
i absolutely hate this programme what kind of people sit and watch this garbage ok my dad and mum love it lol but i make sure i'm well out of the room before it comes on its so depressing and dreary but the worst thing about it is the acting i cant stand all detective programmes such as this because the detectives are so wooden and heartless what happened to detective programmes with real mystery i mean who wants to know what happened to fictional characters we know nothing about that died over years ago i wish the bbc would put more comedy on cos now with the vicar of dibley finished there is more room for crap like this
i did watch all of the film through to the disgraceful ending even though i felt so angry at what i saw i felt that the director was screaming for attention and the only way he could achieve this was to be as repulsive as possible since i have lived in the uk i have come to love this country but this film depicts british young people in the worst way imaginable there is nothing to be said but avoid it it will make you angry and sick the people involved should be ashamed
this movie isn't very good boring and not much blood for a horror film the plot just trods along with not much happening and i think the female vampire was so stupid she had many chances to kill the vampire hunters since it shows her having lighting like reflexes but whenever she has one of them pinned she just takes her time and something always happens where she doesn't bite them no wonder this went straight to verdict not anywhere near as good as the first vampire movie you're a sucker if you waste your time on this
this is perhaps the creepiest display of santa claus ever committed to any medium whether it be a book a picture or a movie santa looks like a perv looking down on the children and the twisted story of bringing merlin in to help him defeat one of minions pitch doesn't make things any better laughable to say the least with bad effects even for standards if a kid were to watch this movie he'd have nightmares and never want santa to visit they'd be scarred for life imagine the in a christmas story when they start screaming after being put on lap how this would turn out if see this movie
i had the distinct misfortune of catching up on two of worst films back to back this morning first the incoherent cgi-driven emptiness of the chronicles of riddick and then the embarrassing vanity project known as greendale one cost multimillions and the other cost pennies but they're both bad really really bad front i should state i'm not the biggest neil young fan but he has contributed his share of classic tunes from buffalo springfield best recordings were young compositions to rust never sleeps harvest and mirror ball the man has penned some really great songs sadly there are no great songs in greendale and precious few good ones and the film around which they are built is truly cringeworthy and simplistic political sloganeering completely without merit as art and unimpressive as polemic greendale is best left forgotten buy the book if you feel compelled to contribute to bank account
dragon fighter is the first sci-fi channel i guess now called syfy original movie i have ever seen but i have seen one or two others since and i can tell you that they were stupid but this one really scrapes the bottom of the barrel the cgi is done poorly the acting is bad the script is ridiculous and what happens at the very end is unexpected and out of place you have seen dragon fighter you probably know what i mean i didn't want to put a spoiler in my review plus there was this one musical tune that was used in pretty much every single dangerous sequence that was really stupid they just played it over and over and definitely not original i know i've heard that somewhere before just can't remember where this is one to avoid
don't even waste your time let alone pay rental for this piece of dreck how it got made is beyond me don't know why a minimum of lines i've already summarized this trashy movie but oh well the acting was awful like they all needed lessons the plot was weak the ending feh i think the cinematography was the only thing that didn't totally suck well maybe the sound was minimalistically ok the one good thing is if they could make this movie even make some money with it there may be hope for any screenwriter with a real idea so you-all take heart i guess the same holds true of actors if these people actually got paid then you can too
i have seen a lot of bad films most of the time i can enjoy a crappy horror film for what it is but this really takes badness to new is bland the plot for what it is never really goes anywhere and takes its time over it there are no shocks no horror no suspense just a load of guys rubbing themselves for an hour and a half and then a quick blight on the crappy horror genre avoid at all
this was one of the worst movies i've ever seen horrible funny at all and well just can only assume all these out of fav all time movie comments are actually the actors themselves in what the runtime on this movie is i'm sure its listed on this page it certainly felt like an eternity your looking for a tough to sit through this awful waste your time as i did on this one
this movie is one of those i regret having invested minutes of my life that i'll never get back in the premise is really interesting essentially a zombie flick from the perspective of the undead not split hairs as to whether they're actually dead or unfortunately they fail to deliver a compelling story within this framework the nearly unbearable monotony of the lives of the central characters may add to the realism of the film but it sucks all the entertainment value right out of it if they had put a little more effort toward keeping the viewer engaged it would have been much more likely that they drive home the social commentary
one of my sisters friends lent me this game and it is too damn hard it carries the appearance of a kids game but you have to learn how to do tons of intricate moves that require you to twist and turn your hands into all sorts of awkward positions and you have to search seemingly endless levels for notes to improve your score you also have to find these impossibly hidden jigsaw puzzle pieces that require you to do almost impossible tasks to get them and i am only up to stage three maybe if you have no life nad can stay home all the time you might get some enjoyment out of this but otherwise keep away and it is definately not recommended for kids they will pull their hair out within the hour
this movie is a perfect example of an excellent book getting ruined by a movie jacob have i loved is quite possibly the worst film that i have ever seen there is no storyline plots disappear and the editing is awful to top it all off the music is straight from a synthesizer and sounds unbelievably terrible bridget acting is decent but everyone acting is totally amateur i would suggest this movie to someone who is studying to be a producer as a study on how not to produce a movie as it is chock full of bad cut-scenes bad transitions and acting that should have been re-shot read the book and don't waste your time with this film
although robert knox benfer has his fans i'm not one of them his films are asinine and amateurish and and just not very funny unless you're a year old with an underdeveloped sense of humor certainly not famous as him immature fans would like you to believe by harassing people at wikipedia or stuffing the ratings votes here at the imdb certainly not been profiled by any major media outlets which speaks volumes about his and his does have some slight skill at limited animation but he needs to get away from his young sycophants and learn to write some actual funny material before he'll be taken seriously as a real entertainer as of this moment though just a kid with a camera and it shows
robert wagner is the evil boss of digicron a telecommunications company with a virus that kills you're saying that the software virus has become a real virus that can kill people that may be medically possible but not possible from my system having to write some new virus software of my own to trap it it may take some not going after software killing out for the i'm into virology love moment and perhaps first ever film plot to feature death by braille keyboard
i agree totally with the last commenter this could be the worst movie ever made i too had to fast forward through most of this movie michael madsen must have done this movie as a favor to picture quality is grainy all the way through and what little plot there just plain stupid i give this movie a out of if i could give it a lower score i would don't waste your time on this movie or you'll regret it
this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen while featuring good actors the movie doesn't live up to the expectations the most dramatic thing about this movie is the music which pretty much sums up the movie compensating for a bad and confusing storyline by having known-good actors loud and dramatic music it doesn't change the fact that this is a very boring movie to watch earned itself a score of
the clich√©d polynesian males drink fight and make a stream of sexist stupid and unfunny remarks real life polynesians are much funnier than these stereotyped cardboard characters the supposedly samoan girl didn't look or act samoan at all seemed more like the stock white female who has sex with anyone on a whim with weak as water story lines you can't say anything about the acting even the most brilliant actors could do nothing with this script sad to see polynesian actors willing to play such sad stereotypes in a film with not one good scene and only two or three jokes what a waste of kiwi taxpayers money what a lost opportunity to make a great film about a vibrant community better not to make movies if they're as bad and mindless as this
this movie sucks ass something about a heatwave in some european country complete trash nothing going for this movie whatsoever maybe seconds of sex but it there is a very annoying chick who hitches rides with people and really pisses me off this movie is complete rash and you shouldn't subject yourself to watching it i regret it very boring i would rate it zero but i can't no body in their right mind should see this i'm sure you'll regret it completely i did how could they think up something this bad even mystery men was better mystery men that sucks that movie wasn't worth being made complete waste of time the characters in this are very hard to understand and i good very very very bored
i just came back from el otro playing here in buenos aires and i have to say i was very disappointed the film is very slow moving get me wrong i enjoy slow moving films slow to the point of driving you crazy all you hear is julio chavez breathing heavily throughout the whole film this is a poorly made film but more importantly it is a film without a lick of inspiration i felt nothing for the story or its otro was made only for the sake of making a film making it forgetful i would advise you to pass on this one if you want to see good argentinian films look for films by sorin
one of those why was this made movies the romance is very hard to swallow it is one of those romances that suddenly click they are in love the movie is filled with long pauses and uncomfortable moments the drive-in restaurant being the most notable charles grodin does a credible job but for most of the movie just him and louise lasser ask yourself do you want to watch grodin with his neurosis and lasser with her neurosis together for a hour and half
they have sex with melons in first i doubted that but after seeing the wayward cloud i changed my mind and was finally convinced that they have sex with watermelons with people dead or alive no safe sex of course the ugly leading man shoots it all into the mouth after he did the dead lady never heard of hiv guess rest of this movie is mainly boring but also incredibly revolting as a matter of fact in parts it got so disgusting i couldn't take my virgin eyes off sex with dead people how gross is that and the message behind it all we need water we need melons we need to be dead to have sex sorry but this stinks
yes it can be done john de bello and costa dillon cleaned out the garbage of their minds and come up with the worst comedic horror sc-fi musical if there is any acting it is terrible or way over the top special effects take your low budget or kindergarten every cheap clich√© thought of is used no doubt a fun movie to watch worth a cold six-pack or two point the finger at radiation if you need an excuse mutant tomatoes grow to almost the size of a tow truck and begin attacking mankind san diego is a good place as any to start scientists and an absent minded military must find the way to stop this red rolling menace this cult favorite features david miller eric christmas al sklar tom coleman sharon taylor and john qualls
his costume drama is ill cast and without sanders was a superb character actor but he is thoroughly implausible here as the lead an eighteenth century rogue known for his philosophy and great good looks his costar is of all people akim tamiroff some frenchman then signe hasso in a dark wig as the virginal daughter of a wealthy family carole landis fares best the movie opens with her in silhouette she is a soubrette and a naughty girl at that she disappears for a while but turns up in an improbably situation but good she was always an appealing actress here she is cast closest to her usual type of meant to be a little naughty kind of ooh-la-la it ought to have had a light touch but a leaden affair from start to finish
i can't believe this film was allowed to be made these people should be drug out and beat with blunt objects they should be tortured this film is an nothing but footage from the first film whatever is original is freaky and makes no sense whatsoever like some sort of drug with the laying on a mirror naked therapy also whatever moron patched together this turd didn't even bother to watch the first film because they kept calling suzanna character natalie when lacey i felt like shouting that at the screen lacey lacey i give it a out of my god
ah yes the a time of reaganomics and sly chuck and a host of other action stars hiding in a remote jungle blowing away commies at the time i believe how movies like rambo missing in action and uncommon valor and who can forget the ridiculous red dawn made money at the box office turgid action crap fests with a rather off putting right wing agenda and they have dated very badly war is a tongue in cheek take on these type of movies but got to ask yourself did they need spoofing in the first place of course not war lacks any sort of sophistication though it does make the point that no real difference between right wing tyrants and left wing ones and sometimes feels more like a grade z movie than a send up maybe it is
unless you're twelve this movie really isn't worth it obviously a low-budget film with b actors and with a genre like fantasy that sometimes requires intense cgi work not good i knew it would be bad when i rented it i enjoy laughing at bad movies i didn't know how bad though bearable until after hour then it really starts to burn fighting styles go between normal fighting that obey the laws of physics and wire-fighting no real explanation for the transitions it has a plot but once again obviously a movie it seems like there are explicit moral lessons of the day that are being conveyed like sesame street or something bearable but much better if you're say nine
i went to see this film with low expectations but hoping to be charmed by seeing my home town on film sadly about all i got the story covers familiar territory high school reunion but the plot is convoluted and supernatural element adds little to this well-worn theme though the quality of the acting was good overall the content of the film was appalling the sexism of the film was are apparently unfulfilled unless they are married procreating or both this was couched as a post-feminist choice worse still was the shrill jewish mother the black man who still lives at and gratuitous cruelty the class geek we should be ashamed if these characters are thought to represent the inhabitants of the city of kalamazoo and the writers should be abashed at having brought such broad and cruel stereotypes to the screen
i usually don't walk out of a movie but halfway thru i did this movie promised something different but i kept thinking haven't i seen that before spoiler alert back in the spaceship crashes and lands on earth well all these years later with a super adult on board no less this thing still manages to burn up and crash what this advanced civilization can't seem to develop landing gear for an industry so liberal we get to see another woody allen movie no blacks please superman runs around saving people making sure he sticks to europe and the us don't go into darkie areas please maybe i could stomach this about years ago but now now
looking through the other comments i'm amazed that there aren't any warnings to potential viewers of what they have to look forward to when renting this garbage first off i rented this thing with the understanding that it was a competently rendered indiana jones knock-off what i got was one of the most offensive movies i can remember trying to sit through made all the more shocking by the comparatively high production don't think this is a spoiler but if it is be your idea of entertainment is watching bimbo getting raped from behind by fearsome tribal chief while she is staring into the dead eyes of her significant severed head by all means rent this flick if not i'd advise you to look elsewhere for to think of it that scene so succinctly sums up the movie that nothing else i really need to say about it
the first film i had to walk out on and it was the cast and crew pre-screening that i was involved i hasten to add i made it through the first hour so i reckon i'm just qualified to comment but that was my other comments here how did this get through any kind of qa an accumulation of the very worst in dialogue the epitome of wooden acting awful casting all wrapped together without a casting was bizarre almost comic she possesses the worst russian accent in movie i left the screening the director and producers were drinking in a bar outside the cinema they obviously couldn't sit through it again
good folks i stumbled on this film on evening while i was grading papers my academic specialty is anglo-saxon literature and i can say that no one has ever done the genre the honor it deserves the icelandic beowulf and grendel is the least offensive i have seen and i did pay for my copy this sci-fi version ranks with the christopher lambert version didn't i like cgi for one amazingly bad more importantly is the faithfulness to the storyline not to mention the stilted acting i am used to both with all the versions i have regardless peter
ok people honestly this gotta be one of the worst movies about show biz ever been made but i've been laughing myself silly may be why i enjoyed it basically all about sex sex and a way to get your own personal minutes of fame did i mention that sex was a major issue in this movie if you have a thing going for bizzzzare characters and easy entertainment watch this movie when you get the chance don't have something better to do the funniest thing on the movie was the guy who asked jerry whether he could marry his goat on the show and flashing his wallet with his pictures a triple a for bad taste and fun
and so the great rewriting of history continues hollywood was senseless ridiculous shocks me that such an amazing amount of money can be spent to produce what is the most contrived poorly acted inaccurate film i have ever seen it is brief flirtation with serious acting appears to be over i can only assume that leaving las vegas was a glitch in an otherwise litany of dreadful kruger proves that her performance in troy was no fluke she really can't keitel should be ashamed of himself for working on such recommended for those either recovering from a recent lobotomy or people of an opinion that america invented the world
the acting is some of the worst i've ever seen the characters are totally unconvincing this could be overlooked to some extent if the plot was interesting which the plot to the prodigy was not sort of a bad mix between fresh and animal house except that both of those movies were good
unfortunately the realism is boring this movie i thought it would never end would have been better if all the characters would have been nuked in the first five minutes blade when you need him while as dismal as combat shock requiem for a dream and as nightmarish as boise moi dead creatures isn't nearly as entertaining as any of the aforementioned bleak movies while the gratuitous cannibalism might make the wannabe jeffery dalmers hearts race a little faster it wasn't nearly as interesting as ravenous really i found it about as interesting as late-night infomercials and as exciting as a trip to the dentist if you have strong masochistic qualities you might be able to endure this otherwise for no one i was really surprised that this one wasn't made by the people at brain damage as that was the quality of dead creatures
william followup to maniac proves conclusively that without tom spectacular effects and convincing performance maniac would never have become the cult hit that it did vigilante is badly directed with a simple-minded script that spells everything out for you and is predictable at every turn and also mediocre performances by all the actors judging from the sense of deja vu this film gave me lustig had watched death wish several times too many before making this
this movie had a imdb rating of so i expected much more from it it starts out funny and endearing with an energy that feels spontaneous but before the movie is half-way through it begins to drag and everything becomes sickingly predictable the characters in the office were delightful in the first third of the movie but we get to know them a little too well they become caricatures not real people at all this is the same story i've seen hundreds of times only told here with slightly different circumstances the thing is i could stomach another predictable love story if only the dialog weren't so only thing that could be worse is if the characters had inconsistent and unbelievable motivations and unfortunately that was also the case with dead letter office hopefully this movie will end up in the dead movie office soon
back in the when i had first seen this i was in high school it was cool then now as an adult i look back at it and i say to right what was so funny it has moments but they are few and far between it is so dated that the jokes no longer stand up show this to a younger crowd and they will be totally lost if you like this type of humor you may want to stick with kentucky fried movie or amazon women from the moon tunnel vision as well as groove tube are too dated for viewing
being a fan of silent films i looked forward to seeing this picture for the first time i was pretty disappointed has been mentioned the film seems to be one long long commercial for the maxwell automobile if the chase scene was about half the length that it is i may have enjoyed the film more but it got old very fast and while i recognize that reality is stretched many times in films without lessening a enjoyment what was with the mexican bandits i mean they are chasing a car through the mountains a car that most of the time is moving at about one mile per hour yet they can't catch up to it
first off i really enjoyed zombi by lucio fulci this film was utter trash i couldn't stand to watch it the storyline was a joke the acting was a joke and the fact that zombi has nothing to do with zombi is even more a jump from voodoo to death the harmful agent brining people back to life whatever this movie isn't worth the it cost to rent it i really enjoyed lucio fulci movies but this one was horrible if zombi is an indicator for how zombi and are going to be i think i will just skip is an awesome flique tho
how has this piece of crap stayed on tv this long terrible it makes me want to shoot someone so fake that it is actually worse than a sci-fi movie i'd rather have a stroke than watch this nonsense i remember watching it when it first came out i thought hey this could be interesting then i found out how absolutely insanely ridiculously stupid it really was it was so bad that i actually took out my pocket knife and stuck my hand to the people stop watching this and all other reality shows they're the trash that is jamming the networks and canceling quality programming that requires some thought to create
this is only the second time i've felt compelled enough to comment at imdb about a film the first time was for probably the best movie i've ever seen and that was for darkwolf is at the other end of the scale compared to memento as in the worst film i've had the misfortune to see apart from the two scenes containing naked women there is nothing in this movie to raise it from the trash-pile that it see apalling effects cliched script bad acting and about minutes too long my wife and i laughed through most of it in disbelief at how bad amazingly i watched it to the end how i did that i don't know avoid
i didn't enjoy this film i thought the acting wasn't very good and the story was boring a old computer saving the day i thought that this was just slightly far fetched even for a film i couldn't figure out why they couldn't just turn it off why not take a sledgehammer to a shame but after the original film from the you expected so much more than what was actually delivered this film could have been a century version of the old film it wasn't if that is what you want to watch do not watch this film if the old computer hadn't have turned up to save day this would still in my opinion be a very very cheesy flick
ask the dust looked intriguing from the trailer and we especially like all of the actors unfortunately the movie was not compelling enough to be considered drama and it wasn't funny enough to be a comedy it practically seemed to satirize itself and to no entertaining effect after seventy minutes of waiting for this thing to get better my wife and i walked out valuing not having wasted any more time on such nonsense it simply was not interesting moving funny nor artistic it appears as though it were written produced and directed by a high school kid worse yet it was such a shameful waste of otherwise extraordinarily talented actors not to mention our time and money
i've been trying to track down this film just by googling bad phrases about teenagers seduce and kill man in his house and such i think i first saw parts of this film when i was about years old when it was running on cable it made quite an impression the kind of film that kids know they shouldn't be watching and switch the channel when their parents come in when i saw who the cast was i couldn't believe that some of these good actors were in such a horrible movie then again if you like to see men who cheat on their wives get murdered then this is an interesting film also if i recall some pretty interesting pseudo-lesbian moments probably the dumbest ending of all time but
i caught this on showtime tonight and was amazed by how a movie with such a interesting premise could wind up being so unbelievably awful your daddy stars brandon davis as an adopted high school senior chris hughes a geek who inherits the heir to a porn empire left to him by his biological parents though the premise sounds like the movie could be a lot of fun it is ruined by inept directing from first-time director andy fickman a clich√©d and predictable screenplay and acting that is even bad by direct-to-video standards even the normally funny charlie talbert turns in a surprisingly dismal performance as the best friend ali landry is the only good part of this lame and unfunny dud
this movie is likely the worst movie i've ever seen in my life surpassing the previous most god-awful movie spawn of slithis which i saw when i was about acting stilted and ridiculous dialog incomprehensible plot mishmashed cut scenes even the music was annoying did i leave anything out well the special effects weren't bad but cgi does not a decent movie can't believe i actually spent money to see this movie if anyone has the contact info for hyung-rae shim director please forward it to my user name at gmail and i'll contact him to personally demand a refund
this is not michael fault he was hardly in it this movie was just awful if you want to laugh and be bored go ahead and watch this movie words cannot describe how idiotic it is sorry michael the cinematography was dark all the other actors are unknowns when watching it it feels like a soft porn but with no nudity or heated scenes this movie had sexual overtones since it is about a underground s m killer the acting was bad except michael parts he looked like he wanted to laugh i hope he got paid well for this lousy movie it is something i would not be proud of it is not even a b movie for cable it is more like a f and it should never be shown ever
karl jr and his dad are now running an army on a remote island they capture a trio of guys who stumble upon the island whom after a while fight back the survivors this one has non-stop blood gore and carnage which would have been good if any of it looked remotely real or if the production didn't look like it was made with a weeks worth of saved up lunch money may be overexxagerating there it was probably just a couple days worth the horrendous dubbing didn't bother me as much and i suspect if i had been really drunk some of it might have been slightly but as it is at merely minutes the movie still felt way too long by oh i don't know minutes don't waste your grade f extras bonus movie zombie extreme pestilence and trailers for other shock-o-rama released films
i remember being forced forced to see this film by a southern baptist preacher when i was a kid and even then i loved its awfulness designed to scare poor suckers into being saved the only thing that saved me was the fact that it finally ended and i could go out and have a real out the chapter on this film in sarah book the politics of the christian right fascinating and certainly more interesting than the movie
this thing is really awfull no charachter with weight all floating around in the the motion capture is a fine toy but this movie demostrates that you really need people who knows animation to do an animated film the machine do anything well by itself if you see it as a bizarre film have fun finding mistakes of continuity in a movie funny to watch the princess dress move around like a thing with diferent phisics you need animators and animators not data-entries whom know programs note the junctions like the elbows how they lost volume and get deformed the person who made the charachter design very good one sufered for sure when watched them move you say they come to life
budget decent actors who knew these things were important don't waste your time on this piece of junk the effects are crap the acting is crap the only thing that could have made this even tolerable was a little cheap and that gets squandered in the first only even remotely redeeming quality about this movie is the very awkward profanity it was like they found the only people on the planet who have never cursed before hats you want to see some dude in a bad suit just go back and look at old prom photos the only way for a bigfoot flick to be any good is for it to have a big budget and some actors who didn't come from frogballs community theater
first of all jon bon jovi doesn't seem to be in place in a vampire movie together with the other not so interesting characters and the poor storyline the whole movie becomes predictable if you keep that in mind and you're a total vampire movie fan you can have some fun with a few of the scenes don't expect any tarantino-style chapters here and neither an anne rice storyline expect to have have forgotten the whole movie by tomorrow
sums this movie up in one the crap was this it might kill me to use the word hope the producer didn't mean for this to turn out it sure scientist turning his son into a hammerhead the shark killing a bunch of people the scientist invited to the my hate this film so much that when i was watching it i laughed at all the serious they were so corny and they couldn't have made the shark look more though this thing had a bit larger budget than most low-budget i have to say is watch this movie expecting to laugh at all the bad stupid corny if you are expecting a good movie you'll be highly disappointed
i just finished watching this movie and i found it was basically just not funny at an rpg gamer type none of the dnd tabletop stuff but i found none of the jokes in this funny at of the scenes seemed to drag out a lot and zoom could've been cut down to rather than over a minute and it feels as though the director was just trying to fill in think i laughed a total of times in the entire acting itself wasn't all that bad around the standard that a b grade movie should suggest not bothering with this movie unless you're a huge dnd fan and even then it would probably be best to steer clear of it
i cannot believe that this movie was ever created i think at points the director is trying to make it an artistic piece but this just makes it worse the zombies look like they applied too much eye makeup the zombies are only in the movie for a few minutes finally there are maybe five or six zombies total definitely not a nation the best part of the movie if there is one is definitely the credits because the painful experience was finally finished again to reiterate other user comments the voodoo priestesses are strange and do not make much sense in the whole movie also there is a scene with a snake and a romanian girl that just does not make sense at all it is never explained
there are those movies that are bad they are funny then there are those where you scream i want that one and a half hours of my life pretty much what this cain tries to be an actor but fails the sfx are really bad scenes and rocks that look like falling paper and the fake plastic guns that have torches taped on split screen effect used to show multiple things happening at once is just movie cant even be used as one of those simple night entertainers its just that i could go negative ratings i would
this was probably the worst movie i have ever seen in my life it was stupid there was no plot and the special affects were ridiculous and i have never seen such bad acting in my life the only good part about the movie were all the hot drew fuller i don't know what these people were thinking when they made this movie i didn't even want to finish the whole thing because you get to this point in the movie where the guys are all in bed touching themselves i mean it was like some kind of sick and twisted kiddy porn i would advise anyone who has heard of this movie and was interested in seeing it to just forget about it and find another movie to watch i was very disappointed the whole movie was a complete waste of time in my opinion
this film is really bad that even christopher lee cannot save poor story an even poorer script and just plain bad direction makes this a truly outstanding horror outstanding part being that it is the only horror film that i can honestly say i would never ever watch garbage make plan nine from outerspace look like oscar material
otherwise it is one of the worst movies i've ever seen and i mean ever my wife and i were both bored out of our minds within minutes not to mention being boring it is entirely unbelievable women don't bathe together nor do they accidentally kiss brothers and sisters don't live together well into their and run around swing dancing together and engaging in footraces in central park men don't find out their wife and sister romantically kissed the night before the wedding and then never discuss it with said wife absolutely graham is possibly the worst actress in films today she smiles when she should be crying and vice versa the only movie she has ever been good in is boogie nights and that is because she wasn't cannot stress enough how bad this movie was
i had to watch this in school and to sum it actors talentless script and a talentless movie is such a waste of your time don't even watch the movie don't bother you will be so disappointed my teacher said it was supposed to be good how wrong she was she even slept through it a little the actors were just bad the best actor in there was the old man and not saying much has horrible plot with awful characters so unrealistic and i can honestly said it had no point the script was unemotional and confusing there was points in the movie when i furrowed my brows and said what also there were just too many loose ties and plot holes it was just absolutely horrendous
cynthia made this film enjoyable to watch and of this cute petite gal burned up the screen with her artistic abilities and hot sexy body china o'brien gets upset as a police officer and decides to call it quits and go back home to her hometown and get back to her roots and her dad who is the local sheriff her dad is getting older and the town has changed gangsters have taken over the town and started to get the local women to start turning tricks and the city people were getting sick and tired of their town going to hell well you almost can guess what happens and you are right china o'brien fights back after great tragedy strikes her life bad acting through out the picture but cynthia rothrock brings this film to a wonderful conclusion
i watched this movie with some friends a couple months ago i still laugh today thinking about some of the utter stupidity the first few scenes alone were hilarious i won't spoil anything for those who wish to see it i wouldn't want to ruin the laughs needless to say the entire time i watched this movie i was trying to figure out exactly what the point of anything the characters in this movie were doing towards the end we all got bored however as the initial hilarity and shock of a movie being this random wore off there is no plot and not a trace of decent acting the characters are about as well developed as those in a kindergarten learn to read book they even managed to make a lesbian sex scene uninteresting
bought this movie in the bargain bin at rogers video store for i enjoy a good b movie now and then and figured this looked like a good movie is quite cliche and is quite groovy for that unfortunately the story line is hard to follow and not a lot happens in the movie in fact i turned it off after watching it for minutes and figured a week later that i should watch the whole thing no matter how slow it movie has good spots in it but you have to wait and wait and you are into b movies this might just be for you just be warned that the movie is slow and not much really happens and did i mention not much story line
i actually had hopes for this movie since i've seen kari in a few other things and think she has some talent alas this dud is a case study in what not to do in a screenplay completely undefined characters without a shred of likeability and no plot whatsoever is it a the filmmakers don't have a clue and neither do we
i don't think i'm too far off base saying that this is possibly the worst movie i've ever seen i've been working on a list of my favorite war movies the longest day to hell and back bridge on the river kwai black and white which all have good plots rich characters and great acting i've seen better dialog and acting in student-written high school one act plays the plot however isn't a bad premise just poorly implemented kind of like a traffic accident though i couldn't seem to turn it off a movie doesn't need big money or great sets twelve angry men and lifeboat to be good so budget is no excuse what were they thinking
i wanted to love this movie how could i not love it cary grant jayne mansfield stanley donen all icons in their own way however the train wreck that was suzy parker ruined the entire experience for me her acting was so appalling that i sat there with my jaw hanging open not believing my eyes or ears i could barely make it through one viewing how hideous she is in gorgeous and in fine dramatic form jayne adorable endearing and obviously having a ball the supporting cast does alright and the city of san francisco is captured in all its stunning retro you see suzy parker attempting to speak her lines with a woodenness a deadness a cluelessness that simply defies belief who told this creature she could act oy vey people
this isn't a movie it is a collection of unrelated ill-conceived and poorly assembled scenes that look like the unedited results of a dim year old with a mini-dv camera in fact i have a theory that the extremely abrasive girl in the train corridor the one with the greasy hair dead-pan stare ipod and nervous tic probably shot it herself in a creative you made it further than the ten minutes i did don't bother trying to fit what you saw into the context of the european artiste mentality praised above this is a true and complete waste of time money and film that would have made william one-shot beaudine unfortunate part is that the endless series of vacuum-packed characters is representative of what now passes for much of next six directors shooting social intercourse at the wal-mart snack counter
this production has absolutely no storyline the acting is embarrassing the promising dutch television sophie hilbrand star should not add this movie to her cv her acting is far from flawless and personally i think she has crossed boundary of professional decency relating to the way she exposes herself in this movie this movie contains too much unnecessary nudity vulgar sexual scenes and rude language it also shows a wrong image of the netherlands most movies do do not bother to watch this movie a waste of time a waste of money and an embarrassing record for hilbrand who has proved to be better with her close on on the screen
thank god i watched this at a place and did not pay for it the plot is horribly transparent and the whole movie felt like an episode of a tv show if you have any knowledge of computers or electronics watch out you will feel feel like the movie is an insult to your intelligence actress turned much music vj amanda walsh displays the worst acting i have ever seen excluding porn lucky that matt lanter is actually decent the one that carries the movie hate that i wasted nearly two hours of my life watching this movie a shame that they got to call it a sequel because i was a fan of the original which was actually pretty good
personally while i'm able to appreciate really good movies i also have a strange ability to somewhat enjoy even the most crappiest of crap you know those times when you just want to sit there and watch some horrible cookie-cutter action movie to kill time this is the only movie that i can remember actually shutting off in the middle and i have absolutely no intention of going back to finish it the plot was so contrived and predictable i was calling out what the next scene would be easily i'm usually not very good at this the actors were horrible i've seen better acting in middle school plays even the scene cuts were bad the flow was all movie is like a parody that forgot the funny
i love the depiction of the and in film i love salma hayek i was more than ready to love this picture but sir nothing good about this the only entertaining aspect for me was colin character is an insecure writer and this screenplay despite tackling the juicy subject of racism approaches the audience in the fashion of an abc afterschool only person who didn't sound like he was acting was sutherland and his minutes were approach to a tired plot
i remember i loved this movie when it came out i was years old had a commodore and loved to play rambo on it i was therefore really thrilled when i got to buy this movie really cheap i put it in my vcr and started up man this movie is really bad sylvester stallone says like words in the entire movie for that awful sentimental speech at the end and has the same expression on his face all the way and that stupid love thing in the middle just so amazingly predictable i just ended up fast forwarding the entire thing and went to exchange the movie for something else
the really sad thing is that this was supposedly the highest budget halestorm entertainment has had to work with all involved should be fined for littering since all the celluloid they wasted is good for nothing more than filling the trash not only is the writing atrocious and the jokes awful but the camera work and film quality are amateur at best the soundtrack sounds like it was created on some guys laptop pc the worst part of all is that i actually sat through the whole thing i think just because i couldn't believe that i had actually paid to buy a ticket and that the theater i was watching it in had actually agreed to show the film
this is a very cheaply made werewolf flick the video is dark and poorly lit the audio is uneven and poorly recorded and mixed the script is cliche ridden junk with the usual characters like the tough detective who shoots werewolves with his silver handgun of course with silver bullets the acting is as wooden as the characters the fx are of extreme close-ups of werewolf jaws and biting the only thing that is shown is lots of soft-core instead of dropping for this tripe check out a really great recent werewolf pic dog soldiers with sean pertwee
with the exception of the sound none of the above are really criticisms for this type of no budget independent horror film make up effects and gore are very good and the lead actor was effective the lead actress although attractive needs some coaching as she was particularly major problem with frightworld is length at minutes its half an hour too long to be effective as a slasher movie plot wise only about ten minute of the first fifty are places it is visually engaging and sometimes the lack of lighting works in the films favour however when this is combined with the poor sound as is the case with most of the film large sections are difficult to could certainly be an entertaining if unoriginal serial killer back from the dead movie with some judicious and ruthless editing in its current form it plays like an unfinished rough cut
hardly anything at all to recommend this movie chase masterson is always nice to look at and actually can act though her role in this clunker is a waste unfortunately the rest of the cast ranges from bad to mediocre in a lot of films like this someone will shine through the material and you make a note of them for future reference no such luck here creature unknown a clich√©d monster-on-the-loose flick with the kids getting knocked off one after the other the monster is a man in a rubber suit which hearkens back to the days of paul blaisdell so bad good the rest of the show is just so bad bad a little humor might have made this more palatable but everyone plays the deadly dull material straight up there is a twist or two at the end but by then you won't care anymore
eleven great filmmakers eleven pieces of garbage eleven minutes each of sheer tedium sophistry condescension self-indulgence treats for people of all nations yussef chahine of egypt giving a hip hip hooray for terorism in his amateurish segment across the green line we have amos gitai of israel using his eleven minutes to show a terrorist act and focus on a jerky newscaster alejandro gonz√°lez i√±√°rritu of mexico concentrated on the twin towers but seemed to forget to turn on his camera sean penn not knowing that there were no buildings within the shadow of the trade center on shohei imamura of japan ignoring the whole thing claude lelouch focussing on a trivial and cliched love affair ken loach of the uk focussing on chile etc etc
comedy central has had success with original programming using professional comics the chapelle show mind of mencia the daily show and the hugely popular colbert report all star professional comics and all are or in the case of chapelle show were solid shows given that sarah silverman is one of the best female comics in the business i was expecting good stuff when i tuned was so were some mildly funny sequences but given that the star is the caliber of silverman the show could have been much better it was just the pilot and hopefully next show will be better if not get her some help in the form of better writers for the show
as a premise this backwoods version of the dead calm storyline had director eric inability to render a convincing hurricane leads to a deluge of continuity and lighting the viewer is more spellbound by the bizarre weather effects than the intended storyline intermittent spates of ham-fisted over-direction are similarly dance doing an inbred backwoods hardass schtick does his best to save the movie but ultimately undertow squeals like a pig and has more ham to boot
if you didn't know better you would believe the christian moral majority in their preachy testimonial of the sins of the young their questing for satan and that hell was just brimming with advanced dungeons and dragons of these items bears one grain of truth folks this work does nothing but give the southern baptists a chance to take a breath while the movie continues to spout their erroneous and alarmist views concerning a creative and original gaming hanks contributes a stellar performance for this work but even that wasn't enough to save it crap beneath crap it is ignorance breeding ignorance and as such it rates nothing fiend
not just that this is a bad movie not only that four of the best mexican movie makers are in this film and not only that the script is terrible just movie time this people are wasting money in terrible scripts supposed to make a criticism about mexican society but we're fed up with this kind of films is bad language supposed to be funny i don't get it mexican cinema is in big trouble if this kind of movies are going to continue playing being written and don't think this kind of movies are well received in mexico we hate them and they don't reflect us
but a lousy film as maltin says this was christopher attempt to make a serious horror film well it is serious the plot is silly and slow about old people inhabiting the bodies of young children to achieve film is all talk talk talk talk talk talk talk about the same things over and over again i actually dozed off a few times the film is sooooo dull the cast sleepwalks through this with the sole exceptions of peter cushing and this was probably a labor of love for both often complained about horror movies being too this has no violence avoid at all you have will put you to sleep
show me your boobies is not funny and certainly not on a channel that shows cartoons if you understand where i'm coming from i don't want my and years old daughters thinking like that or hearing that i find it sad that nick hyped this crap that much and then what we get stupid little kids acting like stupid adults i know meant to be humorous but consider we out there that have sweet little innocent girls in k and grade who can't wait to see this i had to comment on how disappointed i was when i saw it my daughters won't be watching it i'd love to block nick but don't have the heart at this point but if nick keeps putting out this kind of crap i'll have to
i have to say as being a fan of the man who created thing probably his best you got this pos i can't logically think he put any effort at all into this like he did with cigarette burns at least his son made a decent have to look at this from the standpoint that it didn't seem like a movie it looked as if someone else directed it for one thing i won't believe carpenter put any effort into this at was just listening to his old school fog soundtrack and it was awesome especially for the was using a style that no one had and it worked so well for his films
yep the topic is a straight quote from the movie and i think pretty accurate i was so bored to dead with this pointless effort all the flashes etc making no sense after first minutes is just bad film making if you are epileptic you would have died at least five times already of course all the david lynch fans would raise a flag for this kind of turkey to be the best film ever made because it doesn't make any sense and when it doesn't make any sense got to be art and art movie is always good right i say wrong this kind of artificial art grab is just a pathetic way to try to show that you're a good film maker anthony hopkins as a excellent actor should just stay acting
with this abc family attempt of the hit blockbuster cheaper by the dozen comes an obnoxious amount of corny dialogue shallow plot lines and cheesy comebacks with about two good actors among many this movie was a major disappointment its a hollywood-wannabe ditto of an already bad plot then because they needed a lot of actors that meant that they'd probably be more lenient so the acting wasn't five-star the plot moved fairly fast and the twists were bad and had horrible timing the junction of characters and the end relationships were also too mushy and clich√©d for me spare yourself and rent something better
at first glance this movie has got everything a psycho wants a vampire story with a not under restriction filled with hyper-violence drugs gore sex lesbian sex some fanatics zealots and even a gay necrophiliac cop but then this movie is a succession of bad story thin bad acting a ridiculous english accent making you believe you're watching a bad monty python bad music hard rock the videotaping is awful the ending is a real shame plus the scenes of sex are ridiculous the gore not very impressive and those vampires reflect in a mirror and don't even fear daylight you get to be very disappointed unless you see it as a space mutiny or troll i hope bloodlust will one day reach the bottom because its real say it can still be fun to watch if you have friends and enough
what a disappointment piper perabo is adorable tyra banks is beautiful but pitiful as an actor and the talented and beautiful maria bello is wasted bello must have been embarrassed by some of the lines the plot script and premise is a not against silly movies i think that something about mary is a masterpiece but coyote ugly is a waste of minutes
a somewhat dull made for tv movie which premiered on the tbs cable station antonio and janine run around chasing a killer computer virus about it for trivia buffs this will be noted as debuting the same weekend that the real life melissa virus also made debut in e-mail inboxes across the world
in what could have been an otherwise run of the mill mediocre film about infidelity in the sixties subtle free-love period the creators of this film pile on ridiculous scenario after ridiculous scenario and top it all off with a trite little cherry on top happily ever after ending at no time did i ever feel sympathy for diane lane or anna paquin in their troublesome middle-class care free life nor did i feel for the emasculated liev shrieber the story line plods along slowly to its predictable pathetic conclusion and the only thing interesting and watchable about this film is the stunning diane lane topless a hint it occurs about minutes into the film fast forward to that part and skip the rest
the film looks like as if the director was forced to make this movie by some gang of terrorists it should actually be called dino is nothing good about this movie even the actors are not worth a penny don't waste your time watching this movie the director should be shot in the head for having the mentality to create such a bad movie i mean isn't he ashamed of looking at peoples faces after they have seen his movie the dinocroc looks as if it was made in power point and pretty much cut-and-paste stuff and its the same old story man plays god creates some creature it escapes and is happy eating people and finally a pretty girl and a guy in a sleeveless shirt has to come and kill it bla bla u will figure out the plot in the first minutes of the movie
whoo-boy that was definitely one of the worst flicks i've seen all summer granted it was on sci fi and i don't watch much sci fi but man talk about a razor thin plot and two dimensional characters to the characters were stereotypical and overdone the plot and setting were unbelievable the vampires were less intimidating more funny-looking the gore was unnecessary the special effects were down-right horrible and the ending well the only thing unpredictable about the ending was when suddenly the tomboy becomes a lesbian and starts to do it with the female vampire which by the way isn't really all that hot considering it occurs for about three seconds in which you're closer to what the hell then man hot if this ever appears in reruns god forbid don't watch it
i have seen bad films but this took the made no sense and all the characters do is swear every couple of seconds oh and i think one has a low sperm count its that good a welshman plays a sweary cockney a posh english bloke plays a foul mouthed unlovable rogue of a paddy and some lesser lights play dim there are some russian gangsters oh yes some one has a gun and maybe talks rubbish whilst high on this film like the plague
hard to say what was the worst thing about this show the bad acting poor acoustics of different portions bad cgi improper sets for the period the poor script it would have been nice if the script followed the original tale a bit closer enough tension and good material in beowulf to provide a great deal of good material and a better story line than the scriptwriters could come up why introduce a strange new weapon like a crossbow that fires explosive see that this movie was made in only days it shows in the lack of quality i'm beginning to think this is general attitude taken by sci-fi channel others when it comes to making movies out of classic tales in the past few a waste
watching this was like getting a large mackerel slapped in your face over and over again even when you thought that mackerel surely can't be coming around again there it was i'm not sure what they were thinking this is the sort of pilot i watched and wondered did the actors know they were on a doomed ship destined to never be made into a series not only black stereotypes but swedish and indian ones as well and while blazing saddles made these stereotypes into a mix of comedy and uncomfortableness these stereotypes were just downright offensive there was no plot line the ending was slapped on and the jokes aren't still if you are a student of comedy watch this pilot to see what you shouldn't do
my husband and i went to see this movie being the horror movie buffs that we are two hours later i found myself wanting both my money and time back i was so disappointed the teasers for this film basically contained the best points of the film there was nothing very scary about the film other than good timing on surprise entrances etc i found most of the scary parts to be more comical than anything after viewing other movies based on the works of japanese writers i have to conclude that what is deemed frightening in japan is not what is frightening here in the us my advice if you are a fan of true horror movies save yourself the pain of sitting through this one i can't really say that i would recommend renting it either unless you have a free rental coming to you
after a fairly lengthy partially pixelated nude shower scene we're off to the races for this blair witch horror film about three girlfriends venturing to a desolate cabin deep in the woods to get away from their hectic lives for a girls weekend out and smoke pot they meet two guys who seem friendly enough so they drink and tell ghost stories until late in the movie some of them get picked is a fairly slow movie with needlessly drawn out suspense scenes the bad acting can't carry the myriad of scenes where nothing happens but mindless banter and the movie as a whole is a dud a deathly-boring dud at that nothing at all happens until the last half hour and when it did i was to numb to really candy ashley totin shows evy lutzky gets topless briefly and jennifer hart shows her right tit grade d
i think it was an overrated crap at least brittany performance was good and some others like idris elba were good too but some others teens in the prom like the leads friends were not that convincing the killer was so dumb and looked so stupid too the deaths were stupid boring and completely unoriginals the movie was very boring too and very overrated it wasn't suspenseful at all i almost fall asleep its another bad remake its really a dreadful movie imo the ending was so stupid and the climax was very rushed and boring the movie is pretty slow too overall the only good thing about this crap fest is maybe brittany snow i think she gave a good performance and idris elba too but besides that it was a completely dreadful movie and horrible remake well thats just my opinion i gave it a
this hodge-podge adapted from a gore vidal novel one of the great american writers makes the magic christian and valley of the dolls look like fellini art-works raquel welch with an incredible body actually not very tall in a lead role for kansas city bomber when she was quite good playing rex movie reviewer not critic alter-ego only to be surrounded by drag queen chick mae west horny john huston a young and naive farrah fawcett majors what a shame and other various creep-azoids to pretend to spoof way too may things has nothing going for it except inter-spliced old films clips widmark in kiss of death lena so they can continue to bleed the life out of out of best performance so bad worth seeing
for a film about a killer this is surprisingly much happens and even when things do happen they don't generate any real excitement or acting is good from the two leads cassetti in particular delivers a great performance combining the certainty and stupidity of succo but the rest of the cast also do what they need problem is that there is poor writing and direction and the fact that as a true story it isn't interesting succo is not a unique character he isn't interesting or of this sort normally try to generate tension or empathy or outrage and this generates nothing except a feeling of regret that you wasted your time watching it
i really can't say anything bad good about this thing its characters are likable enough capably produced and designed and professional-looking for that cheesy monster suit however it has no originality no ideas and nothing you haven't seen in alien predator armageddon outland just another formula cookie-cutter grimy corporate drones in deep space versus unstoppable monster flick pretty much a waste of time
oh boy where do i go with this one herendous acting weak plot stupid deaths pointless isn't is waste your money time or life on this pit of damn is this movie awful tom savini why why would you waste your life on this crap this movie not worth it i'd rather snort crack and smash my head up against a wall than watch sinful act take my advice and stay the away from this elephant turd of a film no you know what i shouldn't even have to call this thing a film just stay away
i despise horror movies that is no secret no plot bad acting and gallons of blood are staples of these mistakes of cinema and this movie is no exception i cannot believe some cable stations actually run this garbage particular garbage was released straight-to-video as i recall as mentioning any other movie would be a great insult to that other movie i say this all of the phantasm movies all of the jason movies freddy movies chucky movies and most of the michael myers movies can be summed up in one word iii
i cannot believe that they managed to spend on this film spectacularly bad acting egregious scripting and effects that you could do on your average pc unbelievable plot reporter who can get an inexperienced stewardess a major job at the un what not only that but the message of this film is so unsubtle that you come out feeling as if they've tried to batter you over the head with a full size crucifix all this movie will do will preach to the choir and make everyone else laugh at such a ridiculous waste of money if the makers of this film really wanted to sway people to christianity and show what it means to truly believe they would have used the money to help people truly in need now might have swayed some people into actually listening to them
this film is so bad it made me want to vomit poorly produced a complete laugh free zone why in the name of god would you spoof a movie which to a degree is a spoof a damn funny one at that as it stands the sets are laughable the effects so bad that they aren't even laughable and the acting farcical it is a complete mystery why you would even consider watching this lump of garbage national lampoon once made animal house which people still consider to be completely and utterly hilarious now they've been relegated to making tv movies like this lump of name your expletive and it could be accurately used to describe this film
this superior inferiority to the original dumb blind dead movie is another trash bin waste so many people have hyped up these films that i can't believe what they say about it since i was a kid i have heard about how scary and great these films are and i saw them all and was throughly disappointed was everyone on drugs from the or do they just not know how boring this crude is
based on tom satirical novel that was praised by all have not read it yet tom hanks stars as a wall streeter who accidentally kills a black boy while lost in a bad part of nyc willis stars as the reporter who starts hanks on his downward spiral the characters are very thin and there seems to be no empathy for anyone in this movie and for a comedy or a satire there arent a lot of laughs griffith had her breasts done during filming so a fun thing to do is to see if her boobs change size during different parts of the will keep your mind off other things like the lack of script or humor on a scale of one to
there is no story the plot is hopeless a filmed based on a car with a stuck accelerator no brakes and a stuck automatic transmission gear lever cannot be good i would have stopped that car within one minute whether i was in it or in the police car constantly following it i feel sorry for the actors that had to put up with such a poor script the few scenes that some similarity to action was heavily over-dramatized and as far from reality you can get in addition there were a lot of blunders for instance the hood of the runaway car which was popped doing at first it just folded over the windshield like it would in reality but then afterwards it blew off the car was later in the movie observed with the hood film was nothing but annoying stay away from it
i remember that show i still remember that kick ass fun song funniest people frankly it should've been titled lame or unfunny or downright disgusting people dave couldn't save this show and neither could bob saget or the replacement hosts for afv that came later the jackalope segments were hilarious and yes dave could make some good voice overs that were better than but this show went to hell because of the lame crappy videos people submitted also it developed as somewhat of a variety show with lame guest stars including the olson twins plus afv was in prime before they started picking the drooling ugly as sin babies as the winner did i mentioned the videos were disgusting and lame but still the theme song rocks
if this book remained faithful to the book then we can only assume that the author was ignorant of history mark anthony never died of injuries obtained in battle as depicted he died a death by committing suicide and even then he asked his slave to do it for him the slave chose to kill himself instead in the real story mark anthony was ashamed by the great valor and decided to copy him but even in death mark anthony was a drunken failure and failed at his own suicide attempt he cried out for cleopatra and was taken to her bleeding she hauled his litter up on ropes and mark anthony died a while later if you want history don't watch this movie if you want romantic drivel then you will probably enjoy it
after leaving popular the andy griffith show don knotts gave movie stardom a valiant try with a series of inane but matin√©e-pleasing comedy vehicles unfortunately the reluctant astronaut filmed on the cheap were most of knotts movies is much worse than his others don plays a small town schnook who gets accepted to astronaut training not as a candidate for space want him as their new janitor some may say the weak satire capitalizes on americans then-fresh fever for the new age of technology but the flick is really just a dim excuse to keep restless children occupied it gets off to a good start with an ok set-up and nostalgic locations but it becomes increasingly more spiritless and idiotic from
i don't want to go too far into detail because i can't really justify wasting much time on reviewing this film but i had to give an alternate opinion to hopefully help people avoid the movie the animation is crud and the story alternates between to extremely irritating the humor was completely lost on the audience and yes ghost in the shell fans this is not an action sci-fi or anything like that its an attempt at slapstick comedy and the humor just did not work after being translated it was a total chore to watch this movie and horrible way for me to kick off the film fest especially considering how excited i was and how open i was for anything i wasn't expecting a ghost in the shell sequel but i was expecting something entertaining and it simply didn't achieve this yaaawwnnn rent journey instead
i voted for this movie because it looks great as does all of greenaways output however it was his usual mix of art sex and pretentious know lots of people like this film but i grew tired of it very quickly it is definitely not for everyone the ubiquitous mcgregor obviously took the part for sake i guess but he really should not have wasted his time i hate to consign anyone to corner but please on the plus side it is visually very attractive and i enjoyed the music but could not see it through to the end and i cannot say that for many movies i usually watch the whole thing but this is unbearable
simply terrible why wouldn't you use actual actors look this has to stop stop using non-actors if you want any credibility or any message sent via these low-budget for the love of god use real actors most will work for advantage of that now back to my the humour was lower than that of the bathroom variety and wasn't funny on any level as for the one scene filmed on a public transportation bus you could see the reflection of the what it was one guy with what looked like a sony camcorder and probably not even his well i assume the only audience for this film are people with a gore it wasn't even good gore
a female country singer nicknamed big what they call her budding musical career and her life by falling into the company of a sleazy drunkard who wants to be her manager his mother committed suicide his an alcoholic as well and he has a violent temper you can imagine where that leads in the meantime music aplenty as parton with her fluid vocal talents belts out song after song least half a dozen of them about texas steer clear of this mess and check her out in nine to five or steel magnolias instead
gee what a crappy movie this was i cannot understand what people find so scary about the grudge the director plays one trick have to admit a very good one that is brought to life very stylized and then he repeats it for the rest of the movie over and over again as a consequence i startled a few times in the first quarter of the movie but once i knew the drill i practically fell asleep as the grudge grew more and more predictable by the minute to conclude i can say that there are a lot better movies in the genre to begin with that the so-called predecessor the ring was way scarier and that buying a ticket for the grudge is a waste of money
what can i say i ignored the reviews and went to see it myself damn the reviews were so right what a waste of money considering thing i went to see kill bill after this see a really scary movie would be i like girl in gold boots better than this crap
this service comedy for which peter marshall brother and later perennial host of the hollywood squares and tommy noonan were hyped as the new lewis and martin is just shy of dreadful a few random sight gags are inserted everyone talks fast and nothing works quite right one scene in which noonan is throwing grenades at officers and politicians in anger they're about five feet apart noonan is throwing them in between and the total reaction is that everyone the midst of an awfulness relieved only by the fetching julie newmar there are a few moments of brightness marshall and noonan engage in occasional bouts of double talk and argufying and their timing is nigh unto perfect clearly they were a well honed comedy isn't enough to save this turkey alas
this film had a lot of promise and the plot was relatively interesting however the actors director and editors seriously let this film feel bad for the writers it could have been good the acting is wooden very few of the characters are ever edited this clearly just learnt some new edit techniques and wanted to splash them all over the film there are lots of quick flashy edits in almost every scene which are clearly meant to be symbolic but just end up as wanted to like this film and expected there to be a decent resolution to the breakdown of equilibrium but alas no it left me feeling like i'd wasted my time and the film makers had wasted their money
this movie was as homer simpson would have put it more boring than church maybe i don't understand it well enough and i thought it started out pretty well but after of spoiler hermann braun is sent to jail and maria starts with her boss it just started to drag and i struggled to keep awake again maybe it symbolizes something but the explosion at the end seemed very forced and out of place of spoiler in the end i fail to see why others think so great as i found it extremely boring by the way i did not watch this movie by my own free will as i was required to see it for a film class
and when i watch sarah silverman i get the same results i love quirky irreverent humor but this woman is so darned b-o-r-i-n-g annoying and yawn-worthy also totally lacking in anything whatsoever humorous the deadpan way she tries to deliver her lines is just dead on arrival because just not funny i watched two segments of her program and was ready for my kid saw her promos on comedy central and said she was a dumb chick i thought that was a compliment the one where she says watch my show or i'll kill my dog is actually believable i know a wanna be comedienne she just comes across as a warped nut-case i just don't ever want to see her around my dog
i gave this film stars only because dominic monaghan actually put effort through in his acting everything else about this film is extremely amateur everything associated with the direction of this film was very poorly executed not only should the director rethink what she is doing for a life career but maybe she should watch a few films as dominic monaghan is a very credible actor placing him in a film of this caliber makes him look awful whomever the actor was that played best friend should never have stepped in front of the camera i didn't expect much from such a small film but perhaps a little more time and effort should be put into the characters and their surroundings don't waste your time or money on this film i did you will be sorely disappointed
i had watched the eye before i watched this one i really liked the eye it was one of the best movies of the recent asian horror-cinema so i picked this bangkok haunted because it was the same director and it was kind of popular round here but man what a disappointment bangkok haunted are three stories about love revenge ghosts etc that are no scary at all not even disturbing the eye was no nothing i can't even fill the lines required for the comment rate
perhaps i'm not a sophisticate this and closer are two of the more supposedly cerebral films i've seen recently and both suffer from exactly the same problem to an excruciating extent the dialogue is false false false nothing that comes out of mouth seems remotely believable perhaps the way this film is set up the way supposed to feel but it was unwatchable and boring i walked out after minutes of stick with sleeper and bananas for my woody allen fix if i ever come across this on the teevee i'll turn over and try to find an episode of quincy instead
once in a while a movie will sweep along that stuns you draws you in awes you and in the end leaves you with a renewed belief in the human race from the artistry form this is not it this is an action movie that lacks convincing action it stinks rent something else
this movie is an idiotic attempt at some kind of action thriller a tour bus on its way to las vegas is attacked by a group of white trash hijackers driving dune buggies they drive them out into the desert and then steal all of their valuables the plot changes constantly one minute they are looking to kidnap a rich ranchers daughter the next they are looking for a collectible stamp worth dollars the dialogue is don't watch this movie
for me this is a story that starts with some funny jokes regarding franks fanatasies when he is travelling with a staircase and when he is sitting in business meetings the problem is that when you have been watching this movie for an hour you will see the same situations again and again and again it is to predictable it is more done as a tv story where you can go away and come back without missing like felix herngren as frank but that is not enough even when it is a comedy it has to have more variations and some kind of message to
when i first saw this film i thought it was going to be a good sasquatch film usually when you have these types of movies generally one sasquatch but in this one there is like what or of them acting was good plot was ok i liked the scenes where the sasquatch is killing the first few victims very good camera work i was expecting it to be a gory film but it was very little this movie was way better than sasquatch the sci-fi channel really needs to make more sasquatch films i mean i really liked sasquatch mountain abominibal was not good the one i'm reviewing is ok but the movie sasquatch was not but i'm not reviewing that so let me get back on track this movie is good for a rainy saterday afternoon but for any other occasions no
non existent plot tons of poorly directed super-cheesy scenes world famous sharpshooters who can't even hit their targets a few feet away plus up with the a bunch of law enforcers vandalizing a shooting gallery wth technical mistakes many bullets can you fit into a magazine of a glock these people fire their guns without the need of reloading the movie is so bad that even senior hollywood actor like michael biehn terminator can't save this not watch this movie realized that i wasted some good minutes of my precious life on this one hopefully the director would either stop making movies or learn more for his next movie
this is a terrible movie terrible script bad direction and nonsensical ending also bad performances except from clancy brown who is criminally underused here and michael pollard watching this movie was do it to unload enough bad movie karma to actually see a good one further down the movie presents a father and son who look like they couldn't every possibly have been related the part of the male lead is not well written and seems uncharismatic in this role you can see the plot points a mile away the actions of the female lead and that of her brother the cop also make no sense so a major action on her part at the end of the movie makes no sense script-wise
crime boss is directed by alberto de martino an italian crime drama partially filmed in hamburg germany an easily forgotten movie even in spite of a good car chase sequence this flick seems to lumber on almost aimlessly a new don takes over a powerful mafia family and finds himself fighting for his own life unwritten laws and ethics of the mafia code make it hard to trust in anyone especially when millions of dollars are at stake brutality and violence breed the same in return this can not be put on a shelf with the real gangster epics just the look of the film brings back memories of american drive-in fare even the popular american actor telly savalas can't boost the calibre of this crime drama antonio sabato also stars tedesco guido lollobrigida serio tramonti and piero morgia
when anti-bush jokes get really easy to do a show like this had better make sure it has something extra when that something extra is kid versions of political figures making jokes about the future they don't have yet just plain nonsense dick cheney and george bush are done well but dick cheney mutters mostly also condoleeza rice who has a crush on bush for some reason and donald rumsfeld who isn't really that similar to donald rumsfeld at all the democratic characters rarely give their names so a mystery as to who could be who aside from barack obama and hilary episodes have coherent stories but not nearly enough to keep this from sinking
this movie was physically painful to sit through maybe because many people my age and younger i grew up with dr seuss and loved his books funny clever whimsical and subversive at the same time the cat in the hat sucks all of the interest and spark out of the story and mike performance as the cat is mostly bewildering why the borscht belt accent the unfunny patter the inappropriate jokes the charmless costume i had to go back and re-read the books to see the real problem the books are simple this movie is overblown and way way too don't expect every kids movie to be toy story or the iron giant but this one set a new low how could mike myers need the money
this is the worst movie i've ever seen in my life this is saying quite a bit considering some of the choices i've made in film got this on netflix based entirely on the fact that someone i went to high school with is topless in it the topless scene lasted all of about seconds and the rest of the movie was about as much fun as having pungee sticks driven underneath my toenails whilst being forced to listen to roseanne sing big skits are stupid and consist of the worst kind of juvenile bathroom humor and locker-room gags and such a blatant poor rip-off of the kentucky fried movie that you'll be begging for big jim slade to crash through the wall and save us from the stupidity of vince offer that you are a masochist avoid this pile of rubbish
i just finished watching this on tv and what can i say but this is the worst film i have ever seen i'm embarrassed to be from melbourne where the film was made diabolical acting amateurish makeup effects and a really bad soundtrack as for the plot well thats even more stupid some of the scenes just left me stunned as to how bad it was a reason they put these types of films on late night tv because they're utter rubbish avoid at all costs
what a pathetic won't waste much time commenting about it i'm still trying to get back the couple hours i wasted on me leave it simply with shaq has no business being an actor or singer he is utterly without talent at both discplines a crying shame that substantially more talented people waste away in community theatres and karaoke bars while shaq uses his name as a basketball player to undeservedly get cast in movies and cut of the failure of this movie was the pathetic no-talent that is shaq
the only reason i elected to give this flick a shot was due to the presence of oscar winner ernest borgnine all i can say is it was the greatest waste of a good actor ever put to film as far as i could tell borgnine was the only actor in it the other performances were so uniformly terrible i am amazed a studio would actually pay the performers to appear couple this level of talent in the acting department with a story so plodding and insipid that i thought my eyes were going to start bleeding by the time the credits rolled and you have a perfect cinematic disaster obviously the movie was made to appeal to an audience of children and to its credit it was better than most of the original programing on the disney channel and similar kid-focused networks but honestly that is not saying much
seriously i've read some of the reviews on this film and i have to ask were you people watching the same i give the set directors a lot of credit for being able to recreate vintage los angeles but so what of the characters are likable the story seems aimless karen black is simply not a very good actress donald sutherland is just icky his character homer simpson makes me wish for the animated version d'oh then you had the creepy child actor the creepier billy barty and so is one of those films cinema buffs love and the rest of us look at each other and go what the heck
i saw this movie in new york city i was waiting for a bus the next morning so it was or in the morning it was raining and did not want to wait at the port authorty so i went across the street and saw the worst film of my life it was so bad that i chose to stay and see the whole have yet to see anything else that bad since the year was call me crazy i stayed only because i could not belive it
check out the website more time was put into making that than in the writing of the script for this movie it couldn't be more off in boasting original story original they must have found the script tucked away between the old testament or face legal repercussion for that bit of horn-tooting high-end special effects come on i could do better with an atari and a jug of earwax stylish cinematography oh yes the funniest home video look is still a classic i'm sure they had little money available for this title so of course the sf aren't really that good or a bit bad now and then or just plain hilarious but the story that makes this film a waste of time and money stories rolled into one and all of them brainless bits of seen-befores and
the final pairing of nelson eddy and jeanette macdonald is basically a complete script is weak and has been presented film just has no life in and macdonald would have been better off just making a filmed concert for their final nothing wrong with their just everything else in this turkey thats overcooked
this movie is a vehicle for schwarzenegger-clone alexander nevsky his charisma however is insufficient to lift this movie above the level of its poor script he has little to add to his york is quite pathetic as the begging diplomat watching him revisit his d'artagnan-act from the time that he was a better actor made me feel uneasy come on you can do better than story is full of holes and unexplained relations top of this bill is the informer of vlad who sounds like an american woman but from the context appears to be working for a russian the story takes place well after the end of the communist-regime all the russian characters are still very communist-like in contradiction to that vlad is allowed to drive a pimped up all utility vehicle as police-car the action scenes are poorly shot and therefore lack a must see movie
in general i like dinosaur movies but this one is pure crap no script no dialogues no acting and the brave colonel rance trying to show he is tough and so curving his mouth resembles as a twin brother the stupid proctor from the police academy so this was a complete waste of time not waste of money as i saw the film on tv and i really cannot understand people who graded this they must've joked my advice if you see this title run from it
so this was an hbo made for tv movie eh is that an excuse for such a pathetic plot and terrible acting such a shame to see jim belushi reduced to a role so repetitive at survived lies beaten up survives shot at lies and so ad infinitum call that a script as for the brits embarrassing to see timothy pathetic was he just taking the depends how much he was paid i guess attempt at a southern sheriff as for that other brit the bleached blond one what a there is a trend towards glorifying these english speaking super-violent thugs lately perhaps thanks to mr two movies succeed in entertaining and justify the violence by skillful use of irony and humour like pulp fiction does however this movie discredits and devalues the genre definately one to miss
as long as been technology i think been animation made for it i remember specifically a donald duck cartoon with chip and dale in it i don't remember the name at the moment but the plot was that donald worked at a circus was feeding an elephant peanuts and chip and dale were stealing the peanuts this was made to watch in probably if you happened to watch meet the robinsons in in theaters they showed this cartoon before the movie and explained the details of origin there are probably somewhere around cartoons made specifically to be viewed through glasses this claim was a bad move because not difficult to prove them wrong on top of that this just looks like a bad movie
i went to see this a few days ago and hard to forget that the wrong reasons this film is supposed to be funny not not a single laugh in the perhaps for jos√© garcia and g√©rard depardieu and boring boring boring it was even hard sometimes to understand what they were saying they just talk to fast and don't open their enough for us to understand i was with a friend and more than or times i caught myself saying after a line that was supposed to be funny what what did he say and i'm french i hate to say that given the fact that i think good films are made here but i apologise in advance for all foreigners who will go see the film if ever shown outside of france deeply sorry for that
no matter how well meaning his message is this film is a terribly made trainwreck awful acting lame camera work i do not know why carr agreed to try and pull off a stutter he is lousy at it you watch the extras on the dvd and the way he has a camera follow him around he just soaks it up he loves being the center of attention he is a bad actor he reminds me of another arrogant filmmaker eric schaffer some how carr has had this film shown at city youth centers and new age churches where damaged people looking for reinforcement and attention themselves babble on about how the film touched them and maybe it did but as a film itself it is choppy predictable and sappy
i really disliked this because of the main characters they are both immature selfish and self-centered people they hurt everybody around them playing their silly game the visual effects were good but what good are they if there are no characters that you connect with or a story line that is interesting am i supposed to be happy when these two psycho people finally consummate their love for each other watching this movie i was thinking this is supposed be the smash from for the end good riddance they both deserve each other
the remake of classic seventies chase film is simply horrible along with vanishing point gone in seconds represent the quintessential car chase films the remake takes the original and stands it on its head whereas halicki gave us car chase and supporting drama in giss we get car chase and supporting drama cage as super man saves his brother kisses the girl mtv edits tits and ass save your money rent the original at least halicki didn't live to see his baby wrote produced directed and starred in the film degraded in this manner
i really wish that when making a comedy the people actually tried to make it funny this is a film that you can sit through but nothing is special about it after watching it you will say that it was alright it was not boring to watch but gave the audience no jokes to laugh at entertainment should mean that you actually get something more than an story this movie wanted to be tootsie but instead it gave it a out of
the episodic version of robert starship troopers plays out at a deathly slow pace following johnny rico leaving his parents the very attractive girl he lusts for and joining the mobile infantry the aliens in the show are nothing like the barbaric bugs from the film instead being squid-like monsters that shoot lasers out of their watching this version i was continually amazed at just how fruity they've managed to make the whole thing the show is concerned mostly with the relationships between the recruits and the aching prolonged gazes they give each other through their battle armour visors with synth pop sometimes arriving the sparse battle sequences which at last turning up in the final few episodes in terms of construction it owes a debt to top gun sharing much in terms of pacing and content all that implies
i have no clue as to what this was shot on but you can definitely tell that they had no budget bad acting horrible cinematography and lame plot and some decent special effects do not make a good movie the wwf style cinemtography will make you the tripod the filmakers aimed high but sorely missed their mark
okay if you have a couple hours to waste or if you just really hate your life i would say watch this movie if anything good for a few laughs not only do you have obese topless natives but also special effects so bad they are probably outlawed in most states seriuosly the rating of pg is pretty humorous too once you see the native porn extravaganza i wouldn't give this movie to my retarded nephew you couldn't even show this to iraqi prisoners without violating the geneva convention the plot is sketchy and clich√© and dumb and stupid the acting is horrible and the ending is so painful to watch i actually began pouring salt into my eye just to take my mind off of the idiocy filling my tv screen
this movie is the second worst film that i have ever seen first being ghost rider there is absolutely no plot climax conflict or any other major detail required in portraying a story this film is basically just another excuse for toby keith to show off his manly side and the tough guy he really is i completely wasted my time watching this film the best part would have to be the ending credits if i were ebert or roper i would have cut my thumbs off and thrown them at the producers whoever in their right mind gave toby keith the chance to act in a feature film is obviously on the same mental level as him in conclusion do not waste your time watching this movie it could quite possibly be the only thing you regret
like watching a summer camp home movies indian summer is a sleep inducing bore eight alumni campers are barely introduced when unbelievably boring flashbacks begin for characters we know nothing about fine actors alan arkin and bill paxton are totally wasted in this film one observation that everything seems so much smaller than i remember it is repeated at least ten times enough to make you squirm the anticipated pranks are neither funny or original unless you think that short sheeting is a real howler this movie was a great disappointment considering the ample talent involved indian summer did not make me homesick just sick merk
horror i cant believe how bad this movie the point of this movie the movie almost and min and the first minutes of just lena walking around with this stupid look on her face after she had an much talking at even much actions at all i have to say last minuets it got little tiny action and was still stupid and the end oh my don't know where to also end up with this stupid look on lena face lol don't get me wrong i love lena think she is great i don't know what got into her to do this movie don't waste your time and watching this movie has no no acting and has no to mention how slow this movie goes and it feels like you been watching it forever
i saw this movie a few days ago what the hell was like movies with brian o'halloran they are funny and enjoyable when i saw a name of this title and genre i thought great this one could be really good some parody for slashers or another gore movies but then i read a preview and thought right it could be good anyway but it opinion if like movies they look little bit like documentary with little bit of comedy try some movies or alien autopsy they are really about something this one was empty put a comedy to title no comment really bad joke
the most misogynistic movie of all time not to mention by shouldn't they have moved beyond white people in brown face playing the indians my favorite parts though have to be when the girls giggle and blush as the bikers drag them off to gang rape them rape is fun who knew see then the blatant rip-offs of the hustler boss character actually plays pool while scheming to destroy the indians with the lead rebel dude the horrific acting the so-on-the-nose-they-might-as-well-have-just-told-you-what-to-think music cues the lack of anyone actually indian in this movie and who are we supposed to be rooting for i have to say it figures that quentin tarantino loves this movie even though his movies tend to champion strong women i've heard from at least one source that in real life a misogynistic idiot why did i watch it you ask don't ask
this movie wastes virtually every talents in what could best be charitably called a action-packed top gun opening it is all downhill from there with plenty of stereotypes and unlikely situations following each other until you try to choke yourself on your are so many dead-end story lines in this movie i was guessing at one point it was made by splicing together a discarded tv mexican drug-lord role is laughable and his associates plucked right out of a quinn-martin cop show character is wooden and gives us no reason to believe he actually fell in love with mendez wife nor are we convincingly led to believe the wife is aching for companionship and will jump the first hot body coming a b movie at best and a huge waste of time for everyone involved
hobgoblins what a concept rick sloan was a master with this film he had the brilliance to produce a film with actors that couldn't act on top of that he chose to write a script based on some sort of bad acid trip gone serriously wrong put it together you end up with a film that sucks more than a warehouse filled with suction cups and vaccum cleaners this movie was very painful the pain it caused is about equal to the pain caused by having your genitals carved out with a spoon and then having the entire wound covered with salt and hydrochloric acid
watched this film having really enjoyed girl many years ago this was drivel the plot was vaguely distasteful with the teacher and his friend perving over girls in very short skirts previous commenters seem to think that this doesn't matter but i found it rather nasty if you have children at school then the last thing you want is to think that every youngish teacher is lusting after his pupils we were surprised that the censor let that through apart from that the film was just a waste of time the script was poor and john gordon sinclair trying too hard to recreate his schoolboy image slightly wacky and off the wall why anyone would want to lust after him in this performance is incredible this film failed on all counts for me dreadful please don't waste your time watching it too short
i rented this horrible movie the worst think i have ever seen i believe a grade class could have done a better job the worse film i have ever seen and i have seen some bad ones nothing scary except i paid to rent it and that was too much the acting is horrible the characters are worse and the film is just a piece of trash the slauther house scenes are so low budget that it makes a b movied look like an oscar candidate all i can say is if you wnat to waste a good evening and a little money go rent this horrible flick i would rather watch killer clowns from outer space while sitting in a bucket of razors than sit through this flop again
they should have named this movie blonde women that needed to get their roots colored also the main character geeze the too tight sweaters the giggling thought the guy did a good job though i keep hoping we'll find a good star christmas movie to watch this week the dart throwing had to laugh at that too we've still got more on the dvr to watch maybe we'll get lucky oh yeah i figured the guy out pretty quickly and nailed it when he picked up the flowers and then drove out with his cousin i told my daughter they were on their way to the cemetery and how stupid was it that the two gals followed them there spying on them creepy
i've seen better production quality on youtube i pity the actors as the writing was terrible and the direction shocking not sure how they could get the lines out i really doubt any actor would have been able to salvage this movie no matter how good they were the characters were not developed at all and there was no real cohesion in the plot which just seemed to go nowhere much a shame really as the premise for the movie was good and with better production quality direction and script it could have been a decent movie it certainly was not a comedy unless you laugh out loud at the dubbing which was amateurish even the english actors sounded weird
i had hoped this movie was going to be mildly entertaining like other sorts of its genre however it was lame and i didn't find myself laughing very much watch it on hbo maybe or if you've got a free rental to waste and you need a movie to pass the time but i don't recommend paying to see plot is simple and straightforward and it could have been funny maybe if the script was better jason lee can be hilarious and he gets a few laughs here and there but the movie falls flat just don't go see this one the directing is lackluster but for what it is directing isn't that important i guess its main drawback is that it is just not very funny see something else don't waste your time here
i really enjoyed the first half hour of this movie but wow did it turn corny or should i say just plain stupid this is just another example of outdated humor it might have been funny in but not even powell is always interesting to watch i especially liked him once he started switching from his boyish looks and high voice of the busby berkeley musicals to where mature and sounds it was fine as jimmy macdonald but the rest of the cast just played stupid characters the worst being the boss walburn of the maxford house coffee company who did nothing but shout all the time he was brutal to hear and was a big detriment to the movie
white chicks hold on why couldn't they have dressed as black chicks oh yeah they wouldn't look different at all can anyone give me one wayans movie where they haven't dressed up as ladies don't be a menace doesn't count jack white and michael costanza ghost wrote that other norton trio members acted as white chicks never really any jokes just the wayans acting like girls for hours no setups no punchlines and no laughs there is a lot of i think i'm gonna play some time crisis at least for me there was times to be has to tell kenan ivory damon marlon shawn damien only talented one kim rakeesha george w and osama bin wayans to stop making movies its only hurting the o-zone out of
nothing characters with no personality don't the end never comes because no beginning and no are beautiful shots that are made not beautiful because they aren't even allowed to be because this movie isn't even there no is in this movie because no plot or characters or themes or ideas or symbolism or discussion or dialog or point nothing is a good point it has a good soundtrack but the sound editing is such and the movie proper is such that watching it isn't even worth your time so if you're really interested i'd suggest going and buying the soundtrack or something you'll get everything you can from this movie without all the fatigue headache and
personally i would advise people to stay clear of this movie on the whole a bore to watch and the fighting is poorly choreographed slow and not very convincing if you buy the hong kong legends dvd release of this movie then the only thing worth listening to is the bey logan audio in any case since when has there ever been a ninja film worth watching i cannot think of one and frankly do not wish when it comes to movies i have one golden rule avoid any films that contains the word ninja
i watch bad movie is not good enough to be a bad movie not an ounce of humor not an ounce of talent am i see a bad movie and curse this was so bad i actually made a review to try and save others from the completely boring mess i fell victim am smashing my copy of this too lame even to use clear a room so boring watch bloodsucking freaks or shock shock shock for absolute crap that has some merit as entertainment this sludge looks awful is awful and whoever made it should feel awful
i think if you are into the sixties kind of thing as i am you are obligated to waste about minutes of your life watching this barely watchable trainwreck the saving graces of this oddity include a surprisingly apt social commentary on sixties values along with a number of relatively well known actors caught in early embarrassing footage as if the producers of laugh-in sat down and decided to write a full length film covering all the high points more of the issues between the flower children and the establishment then put it in the hands of a couple of hippies and gave them about a budget to complete it hardly a classic but in its own way it does capture how truly strange that time was the silliness the over-idealism and the uptightness of the establishment clearly not for everyone
cameron diaz is a woman who is married to a judge played by harvey keitel whose life is fine until an ex shows up and things get a little complicated while i was watching this movie there were several times i asked myself why i was doing the movie is so ridiculous and blah and poorly scripted without any believability nor does the audience really car what the lovely cameron can't save this one on a scale of one to
one of the worst films i have seen to date pathetic action scene and really bad acting also do not help the only good point is gary parts but this does not lift the film very much it lives up to its b film ranking and passes the test with flying colours a waste of my money although i found entertaining to begin with its gets annoying after a few watches i do not recommend this film unless you watch it for free or its a gift a gift you can ask for the receipt and send back for a complete
i had to shut this off after about execrable was hoping it might i saw was badly acted directed movie should never even have been released directly to lead character who is a bride top be from hell has an huge ice sculpture fall on her killing her she was such a revolting person i was not even sorry for her she winds up there in a sort of heaven was still repulsive i left shortly longoria portrays her i hope i never see her again she cant even is just plain rudd an actor who normally can do no wrong also was in this biggs no longer a teen is also do like comedies but not stupid ones about stupid of points of imdb of
i actually prefer robin williams in his more serious roles good will hunting the fisher king the world according to garp these are my favorite robin williams movies but seize the day although well-acted is one of the worst movies i've ever seen and certainly the worst robin williams movie worse than death to smoochy club paradise and alladin on good story is going to have its ups and downs this movie however is one giant down i don't need a feel-good hollywood cheese-fest but i've got to have something other than minutes of complete and utter hopelessness this movie reminds me of love liza is actually worse because it seems that the only point of the movie is to see how far one person can fall the answer who cares
this very low budget comedy caper movie succeeds only in being low budget dialog is dumbfoundingly stupid chase scenes are uniformly boring and most of the on-screen money seems to have been saved for a series of crashes and explosions in a parking lot during the last five minutes briefly glimpsed port-a-potty early in that scene is certain to wrecked and spew crap on the chief prop is here without a purpose the whole film is depressingly reminiscent of those that occasionally came out of rodger studio when he'd give a first time director a few bucks and a without the discipline corman would impose
this dvd appears to be targetted at someone who will just put it on and play it in an endless loop in the background organized as a series of music videos of the grand canyon set to various pieces of tangerine dream the td music is dull and the transfer to dvd looks rather blurry and dim too expensive a dvd for what it is
well what can i say there are b-grade movies and there are b-grade movies and this definitely falls into the latter however since obvious that even the makers of the film know that not a credible movie a look at the closing credits it can be plot is basically a convicted psycho killer is killed he accidentally has his genetic material mixed up with some experimental acid that get combined and then lost in the snow the killer now takes on the form of a snowman if you can believe that the snowman jack frost is after the country town sherif who put him behind bars in doing so jack frost ends up killing half the movie lacks any real scares and the effects alone remind me of the b-grade movies of the this alone makes it worth watching for a laugh a movie to pass the time away
i think phillip kaufman read the notes version of the kundera novel and then set about making this film okay of course it won't have the punch of the original novels are great because of his manipulation of the narrative concept his ability to step in and out of stories he constructs this film does not even try the one dream sequence of so vital to the atmosphere of the book is reworked and makes no sense whatsoever also and this is perhaps a lesser point daniel day-lewis looks a lot like ben stiller in this know not really a valid complaint but hey a perfect example of the hollywood-izing of otherwise fine literature
the idea is nice bringing so many stars in one movie is great but too many stories too short and lacking really any sense no connection between the scenes there were some brilliant stories but these were out of the frame reminded me of all the invisible children a movie which i liked a lot compared to it however paris je t'aime lacks the intriguing short story which develops starts and has its end and it lacks the topic connecting all those children i do not find paris enough of a topic to connect short sketches for people who know paris it is interesting otherwise i wouldn't recommend it
this film was the worst film i have ever viewed it was like a homework assignment for a film class it totally misses the mark when it comes to the message it is trying to relay characters are over exaggerated poor acting and as for a it is utterly ridiculous the cover shot is what made me think it may be a decent film the co-actor is handsome and about it moral of this movie never judge a movie by cover save your time money and energy and make your own home movie and you will be far better off than i it was painful to watch and quite frankly i am surprised that anyone would spend money to make and distribute it

sure we all like bad movies at one time or another and we in fact enjoy them this however wasn't even a guilty pleasure it was just crap some guy vince offer who is conceited enough to make himself the main character while probably got thought it was a great idea to make a movie he then proceeded to show his script to equally individuals overall this movie was so bad predictable and unoriginal i couldn't get through minutes of it before i turned it off it makes you got served look like citizen kane bat man guy that walks around with a bat real original almost as good as calling him fat man and having a fat guy walk around in a superhero outfit
this tim burton remake of the original planet of the apes from starring charleton heston is a far far cry from the quality and plot of the special effects have improved since but writing has not the characters were boring and the dialog was awful i sat through the entire film with a friend thankfully only rented it and completely understood why before christmas all of the planet of the apes toys at target were in the clearance advice to tim burton don't put this on your advice to everyone else watch the original planet of the apes movie
the of this film obviously doesn't know anything about film i think the dp on this project was tied up and replaced with a monkey because every seen was either too dark or had the hotter hot spots than the sun story was awful the characters were very one dimensional for someone to have said that this film was made for poker fans and not film fans that someone is kidding their self was probably the no poker fan in this world likes this movie even your money man hates this project to go into a casino and play a few hands doesn't give you the experience to write about poker keep your day job and if playing poker then you must be hurt'n
i am a big fan of karishma kapoor and govinda i watched this film after i had seen fiza which was absolutley are films that are bad and there are films that are but this film just takes the were so annoyed that we were conned out of paying our money expecting a decent at all cost dont even rent
i watched the movie the flock because of the casting of gere and danes and because the story synopsis sounded interesting this was one of the worst movies i've seen in a long while i've seen some turkeys i've never posted online before but this movie was so awful i had to do so i suppose the problems begin begin with the script which was so amateurish unbelievable the story makes zero sense and the dialogue is so trite nauseating poor gere he deserves so much better as for the on screen matchup because of the horrible writing one doesn't believe either character for a single minute i'll bet gere wishes he could buy back the negative were such a thing possible a shame to see talent wasted so badly not to mention i wish i could get my hours back know what you're thinking how do i really feel
this movie is outrageous by outrageous i mean awful i had more fun watching the paint dry at my local hardware store on an august day while suffering from a migraine and heat stroke the acting got progressively worse as the movie advanced and the directors use of euphoric drugs became apparent as the final scenes approached when misty was shot to death she decided that it would be prudent to blink post mordem that was not intelligent truthfully stevie wonder could have caught that with his eyes closed if you are deciding between playing with a nail gun while intoxicated and watching this movie bear in mind that the nail gun will probably give you a better story to tell your friends
i am sorry to say that it was one of the worst films i've ever seen although visually fascinating the use of colour was absolutely stunning it was pretty boring and disturbing the more music is totally absent and if you think of those wonderful soundtracks by michael nyman wrote the soundtracks for most of films then you can imagine what a difference it
where to start this movie started badly and ended badly it consists of extremely poor acting and unrealistic effects that had me cringing in my seat seriously my cat could have acted better than this of it was actually laughable because it was so unbelievable i would of rated this lower but they haven't got anything else so heed my warning and unless your so bored your close to suicide and would like a good reason to continue with your suicide mission don't bother with this one i'm still in shock that this could actually be released to the public this should be a crime and all involved should be arrested i gather you've got the gist by now so i'll leave it up to you to decide
poor paul mercurio after landing the role of scott hastings in strictly ballroom the best film in history he managed to find himself doing a lot of rubbish none of the characters in this film is very unlikable or even hateable but lead is the sort of person you prefer to ignore completely unloveable and he wears overalls big mistake in costume design that one
strained comedy a sketch-like revue which was initially a vehicle to showcase one-time radio star jack pearl but is now best remembered as introduction to the three stooges actually larry curly and moe are billed alongside comic ted healy as ted healy and his three stooges although the supporting cast features jimmy durante is completely wasted on dim material and zasu pitts the only audience for the film these days are stooges-addicts and even they won't find much to applaud here incredibly loud and overbearing it shows how far hollywood had to go to reach a certain level of slapstick sophistication from
why is this show so popular beyond me why people like it i think one of the worst sitcoms out there so popular i've tried more than once to watch it and i can't make it through an entire one thing the acting is horrible everybody is overacting to the point where annoying to watch they talk in unnatural voices use unnatural tones and have unnatural body language i've seen better acting in a kindergarten school another thing not funny the plots are dull they're not creative intelligent or funny shouldn't a sitcom be funny why am i not what is seventies about this about as authentic to the seventies as happy days was to the and what is up with ashton kutcher who cast this untalented dweeb and now making movies oh save us people think this is quality television it worries me
must confess to having seen a few howlers in my time but this one is up there with the worst of them plot troubling to follow sex and violence thrown in to disorient and distract from the really poorly put together can only imagine that the cast will look back on the end product and wish it to gather dust on a shelf not to be disturbed for a generation or two sadly in my case i have the dvd it will sit on the shelf and look at me from time to time
beautiful attracts excellent idea but ruined with a bad selection of the actors the main character is a loser and his woman friend and his friend upset viewers apart from the first episode all the other become more boring and boring first it considers it illogical behavior no one normal would not behave the way the main character behaves it all represents a typical halmark way to endear viewers to the reduced amount of intelligence does such a scenario or the casting director and destroy this question is on halmark producers cat is the main character is wonderful the main character behaves according to his friend selfish
just bought the vhs on this film for two bucks did i waste my money hey i dig adam batman west and tina island louise but hello this third rate production is a rehash of a dozen other biker films crazed bunch of bikers psychos ride into a hick town beat up everybody and everything and then are defeated in the man by a dashing hero adam west looks the part as a hero but missing cape and his batman uniform sorry just isn't the same tina l looks really nervous and frightened the whole show but at least we know what happened to ginger once she was rescued from the the bikers are a motley group and known of them ever acted again or at least shouldn't have hell riders is hell to watch
the small california town of diablo is plagued with mysterious deaths after sheriff robert lopez unearths an ancient has it that the box holds the sixteenth-century mexican demon named agent gil vega is sent to investigate the murders and joins forces with the and mary to fight with evil and bloodthirsty legend of diablo is an absolute film lacks scares and acting is amateurish and the direction is animation is the only one aspect of the film i a big fan of indie horror example i loved sickness or neighborhood the legend of diablo is a huge one to avoid
i am as many are a fan of tony scott films when this movie came out i had high hopes that it would be like man on fire to find out that the movie the furthest thing from it the story was treading water from the get go and the choice of mickey rourke was not such such a good idea and the whole was too gratuitous movie is centered around kiera kinghtly and this movie reveals that she'll never become a movie star the movie brought some of the worst acting like tony direction n all but this takes the whole friggin cake sorry ton out of
american film makers decided to make a film they think is japanese the characters all badly represented the actors are not even japanese and the set is cheap unreal and definitely doesn't represent kyoto in early and who ever read the book understand that the script writers didn't add any extra value to differentiate the movie from the script worse they even changed the original plot line with a few goofs rob marshall is using for his two main characters two well known chinese actors who joined before in crouching tiger hidden dragon marshall probably saw one chinese movie and tho they represent japanese culture seeing those two actors together again even makes the movies more ridiculous quentine last scene in kill bill is ten times more japanese made than that of this movie
so i know that i voted out of but really this deserves no more than half of a star i hated it it was so stupid and unrealistic i can't believe any of the stars signed on to make this ridiculously absurd g and cathrine o'hara were excellent in their characters and ben affleck and christina applegate were just as good too but the story sucked and i encourage anyone who sees this in the video store to not even bother picking it up and reading the back cover but to just walk don't even want to get into what the movie is about because it is too stupid to pontificate rent this horrible horrible
four years after making his directorial debut with the art-house snoozer welcome to alan rudolph shows us what he really wanted from hollywood was to be one of the guys roadie is a frat-boy fracas complete with barroom brawls horny harpies art carney in a souped-up meat loaf at the wheel meat loaf travis w redfish is actually a rather charming presence on the screen and perhaps in a smaller role a better movie he might indeed be ingratiating but zalman script is full of stereotypical redneck humor and helpless meat loaf is kept wide-eyed and moronic alice cooper roy orbison hank williams jr and blondie all make all look embarrassed they certainly should roadie is one bad trip no stars from
wow who ever said that edward d wood jr never influenced anybody this steaming pile of donkey excrement is a perfect case in point it makes the violent years look like casablanca santa claus also makes keith richards worst flashbacks look like my first nocturnal emission i've had nightmares you know waking up and sweating bullets that will never come close to the visceral terror that santa claus unearthed from the seemingly pure soil of my very being however i can think of some parties where this film might actually go over well also if you're looking for the perfect example of a santa-satan dichotomy on vhs tape look no further don't check out this movie as i've been notified the version is now available move over satan santa claus
one has to wonder if at any point in the production of this film existed that made any sense was the rough cut and was it trimmed into the incoherent mess that survives would anyone finance this mess i will say that is a good looking young man and he does what he the dialogue and dramatic situations he is given come and go for no apparent reason continuity and the acting cinematography and direction are it politely amateurish not one sleeps is an of title as it will probably prove untrue should attempt to actually watch this film
i read the book and the book was movie direction the screenplay and the acting were totally insufferable i cringed at the lack of a screenplay that could not follow the novel a novel that has all the action simplicity and courage to illustrate a temerity of a great possibly fact based can see why this movie was not released to the general public in most cities would not ever recommend this film to anyone i know one of he worst adaptations i have seen transformed into a plot less exploration of heaven on cinematography was indeed the only highlight but how could that fail when filmed in an beautiful country such as peru prospective viewers do not waste your time or energy on this flop
well where do i begin my story i went to this movie tonight with a few friends not knowing more than the actors that were in it and that it was supposed to be a horror i figured out within the first minutes what a poor decision i had made going out seeing this movie the plot was crap and so was the script the lines were horrible to the point that people in the audience were laughing cast couldn't have been more plastic looking even some of the scenes seemed like they should have been made much they dragged on for no particular reason very poor in all this movie was a giant waste of time and money boo
why do they insist on making re-makes of great movies like high noon from here to eternity and this do they think that color is more engrossing to a viewer than stark black and did insist on wearing that dopey broad-billed baseball made him look like jim would anyone spend four hours suffering through the original then you won't have to ask yourself why
this gets a two because i liked it as a kid but it became so redundant that i just started to hate it i can't give this a descriptive review because it would be restating one thing after the other i probably wouldn't say anything that everyone else didn't say only other thing about this show is that pretty nasty with the kid with the boil to that twisted babysitter to the stupidity that runs around and about in it i have a cousin that loves this show and the strangest and dumbest person i have met this show should be pulled from the air always the same thing over and over they need to put better shows on nick i'm getting really really tired of stuff like this
a movie with a good cast and nice looking location work but it just don't have it director richard brooks must have been a little bit tired at this stage of the game how much better his the professionals was the horses and the rest of the action seemed to be in slow motion even during the non-slow motion scenes this film needed to be sped-up if anything that horse lather sure looked awful phony to me and the obvious tire tracks in those desert tracking just lazy sloppy work too bad the actors did ok but i've certainly seen all of them do better ben always a joy though i first saw this flick almost years ago was disappointed then and remained so upon second viewing years later
quite the most boring nonsense i have seen in a long time the plot was full of irrelevance and the acting was the worst i have seen in a long make it worse camera angles that made me feel sick were used the incidental music was terrible and drowned out the dialogue not a bad thing then and the shots of san francisco looked as if they had been stolen straight out of the city tourist promotional and the obligatory sex scene was not even half well done better lighting next time please
yes this movie is a real thief it stole some shiny oscars from avatar just because politicians wanted another war-hero movie to boost the acceptance for the wars is still fighting today i do not really want to go here into politics but come on this is more clear than the summer sky hurt locker does not really have anything outstanding no real plot at all i really feel myself in the of hungary when the party told the people what to like and what not to like the same propaganda movies were produced that time only with the exception that those were black and white even if we consider this title a reasonable piece of the wars are cool genre you surely have much better movies to choose from
i have seen a lot of bad movies with big actors in it but this movie was terrible i have yet to see why people thought it was funny the idea behind it is stupid plus all the things that are supposed to be funny are just dumb why anyone would want to watch this more than once just baffles me
this is not a very good telling of the tarzan epic there was only one reason for this movie john derek wanted to show off his beautiful wife in the buff bo derek in was at least a humorous movie and there was a reason for nudity and sex this movie is nothing more than soft porn if you're into that well then fast forward to it and skip the rest this movie bolero was again a vehicle for bo derek to show off her terrible acting she is undoubtedly a beautiful woman but a poster of her is more exciting than this movie richard harris was a better actor than this this was one of his few mistakes don't waste your time on this buy the book instead
william russ is the main character throughout this made for tv movie he left his family behind to only reappear and begin paying off his debts but he tries to keep away from his family thats where peter falk comes in playing several different roles to convince him to come story is average and they actually managed to get a former star falk and use him to a fairly nice degree but william russ wasn't truly a star however it appears his acting is still found the delivery and story very cheesy in how everything was predictable in fact the last minutes i could almost dictate word for word before it happened a good movie should never be like it was a sub-par movie in a letter grading system it would receive a d
this move is about as bad as they come i was however forced to give it a for the scenery there are many great shots of the southwest including many in monument valley one of the most breathtaking places in the us it is also starting with john ford one of the most filmed in fact one scene with kris and the girl was filmed on a place called john ford point
to be brutally honest i loved watching severed why it a stars because of its starkly this film was a riot to watch enjoy watching bad films in order to poke fun at them you get a kick out of story really doesn't matter it involves some guy has a sword and goes around beheading random people he has a supernatural twist nobody ever sees him do it when in one very memorable scene he walks into night club and whacks off some noodle sees it doesn't merely look like it was filmed on it on home camcorder the filmmakers of lighting thin knowledge and holds together in some scenes but mostly you can't actors you can't understand what they're doing and you the next vicitm gets his pumpkin detatched from his and rent this movie support films like they are a hoot hollar
i'm sorry to all the fans but this is a useless movie the acting is bad even wooden it over-hypes the fright-factor early on and doesn't exactly work i think there was supposed to be a twist at the end but it just ended up being maddeningly confusing what the hell the dude who was killing everyone was one of the hunted try hardly original and it isn't even particularly good as a straight slasher and saying think whoever did the castings whoever wrote the script and whoever thought of the concept should be mercilessly fired and watch this movie if someone puts this on at a party throw the disc out the window and put on a good horror movie like silence of the lambs or the shining
what a disappointment admittedly the best of the prequels but the story is weak the plot is rushed and the end result is just a collection of set pieces poorly realised and tacked together amateurishly there are numerous continuity errors that clash glaringly with the original films and the emergence of darth vader was handled so terribly that what could have been a legendary moment in modern cinema is now instead a cheesy goof that will be ridiculed for many years i won't complain about the abysmal dialogue as this is star wars the original three films had style cult feeling and cracking stories and the strange dialogue added charm the prequels were shallow attempts to make more money and this lack of love shows in spades utterly disappointing
this is probably the most boring worse and useless film i have seen last year the plot that was meant to have some philosophical aspects emerged to me as a very bad hollow copy of the matrix with plenty of clich√©s the lone wolf cop good looking psychologically disturbed sleeping with his gun nice hard worker and shy but good looking she-scientist you add a cent plot and you have i robot i was terribly disturbed by the obvious advertising of brands like etc this movie stinks the commercialization and tend to be more a poor ad spot that unfortunately will not end after sec i wouldn't recommend this to my worse enemy if you have some spare time watch a good tv program instead or better read a nice book
bad stuff this movie is real crap bad stunts for one thing they looked so fake i thought this was the twilight zone the flashbacks are pretty much useless one part of the movie he thinks taking his anger out on a window will make his life better i wanna know the casting director and if he was high because the acting even from the adults was horrid a kissing scene in this movie even sucked this movie killed the book the book was great i highly do not recommend this movie not even for educational purposes good stuff i don't know what i can say really there is some suspense parts that get you going but they are quickly shot down by the bad stunt work and acting my verdict do not watch
guy walking around without motive i will never get those two hours of my life back the guy kept on assuming identities and cheating on his pregnant wife what was i thinking how did this win a price anywhere i understood he loved his father but other than that the movie was completely senseless to me what was the purpose of walking so much and going to the funeral of a stranger for no apparent reason how did this enrich his life why did we have to see the dying old lady on her underwear though it would be deep or about something more interesting i do not recommend the movie even to leave on while sleeping
historically accurate hmm perhaps if you squint and light falls upon the subject just-so but core accuracy is no compensation for a dismal patchy and inconsistent plot reams of cardboard dialogue and an unsatisfying conclusion the principal characters are merely characterizations embarrassing stereotypes that range from the enigmatic and noble american indians through to the stuffy but sadistic british officers a wretched and unworthy rendition of a fascinating period in american history i want my money back
i saw this movie with low expectations and was not disappointed its so bad that it is actually funny in a very cringe worthy is absolutely terrible i mean he just cannot act period he should give up now as acting is clearly not his thing his co-stars are about the same caliber i'm sure my year old cousin could do a better job than all of them the director should be ashamed to have put his name on something so ridiculous somehow i don't think an oscar is on the cards for this have never written a comment on imdb but this movie was so bad i felt compelled to do you get the chance to see this film don't if there was a
following the disasterous revolution this film was pretty much the final nail in the coffin of goldcrest and thus the british film industry the film is absolute pants full of music from the attempted jazz revival and based on a book author that was briefly popular at that time and has deservedly sank back into obscurity temple searched for ages trying to find suzette and came up with wonders patsy kensett another person who was briefly popular at the time by the time the film came out of post production the jazz revival was over as was career and the film met a totally uncaring film would be an overstatement for some of the acting to ever grace the british silver screen watching it almost years on and the film is truely cringeworthy
a friend of mine bought this film for and even then it was grossly overpriced despite featuring big names such as adam sandler billy bob thornton and the incredibly talented burt young this film was about as funny as taking a chisel and hammering it straight through your earhole it uses tired bottom of the barrel comedic techniques consistently breaking the fourth wall as sandler talks to the audience and seemingly pointless montages of hot sandler plays a waiter on a cruise ship who wants to make it as a successful comedian in order to become successful with women when the resident comedian the shamelessly named dickie due to his unfathomable success with the opposite gender is presumed lost at sea character shecker gets his big break dickie is not dead rather locked in the bathroom presumably sea from his mouth he just vomited the worst film of all time
i still find it difficult to comprehend that a movie as bad as this could be made in hollywood the acting and story is simply pathetic the direction is awful i don't see any logic behind this trash except may be that the director had nothing good to do i took me ten minutes to realize that i had wasted my precious thirty rupees it filled me with dismay that i was going to waste some more time of my life on this crap i bet the movie was made in less than a day i don't know what category it falls into please avoid this movie at all costs just do anything even bang your head against walls but don't go for this movie
if you liked watching mel gibson in million dollar hotel then you might enjoy watching burt reynolds in yet another film so bad it could never be distributed i can only attest to the dvd version so maybe the vhs version is better quality wise but the movies night and dark scenes have been so poorly done that everythings seems red i first thought my dvd players was messed up it wasn't if you insist on watching it i recommend you adjust the color on your tv until it is black and white if you don't you will never be able to get through the film if you do it will simply remind you of a poor film students attempt to revist the style of pulp fiction
firstly there are some good things about this film but all cliche slasher stuff combined with a teen movie in the advertising of this movie that i've seen a large emphasis was on the fact that denise richards is in it but a poor actress and not as good looking as people try to make her out to be that that has anything to do with the movie and with that look she gives everyone perhaps part of the character but like i said the acting still the writing is fine you know who it is all throughout the movie and you can almost predict what is about to happen but not in an irritating way i think the book based on is probably good judging by the plot line but next time i'll read the book to find out rather than watch this
this film was rather a disappointment after the very slow very intense quite gory beginning the film begins to lose it too much plot leaves too little time for explanation and coming out of the theater i wondered what this was all about the characters remain shallow the story is not convincing at all most of it is d√©ja v√π stuff without hints of parody and there are some very cheesy parts like the young cop has to do dig up a body of course night and it rains and he has to do it alone yawn or the manifestation of the evil being nazis plus genetic manipulation wow really original there are some nice bits though like the fistfight scene mountain views and some gags but reno and vincent cassel do what they can definitely not worth it out of
are we talking about the same movie this movie is totally ridiculous the plot is disgusting and completely without logic its a typical straight to including all the necessary ingredients for a horrible movie experience over-acting by has been actors side steps from the plot that are left unexplained the girl shows her god why people do not react to things as they would in real life i'm not even gonna bother you with details it would take all night well ok just one if two people were murdered in front of you as you were walking down the street one of the victims practically dies in your arms his blood spurts from his head-wound all over you would your first concern be oh he left the world and the last thing he saw was my angry face my thoughts goes to harvey and his lost career
the point of reviewing a movie like this painfully and embarrassingly bad not even in a way that allows you to make fun of like little man depress me they represent film at its most disposable this movie was made for a bunch of year old frat boys who the studio was hoping would come out and see it on opening night before word leaked out about how bad it was so that the film could quickly recoup its hundred other filmmakers with great ideas probably couldn't get their films made because resources were going toward making this puddle of f
this film is really bad with a script full of memorable lines and incredibly bad performances the special effects are also bad the worst ones i have seen either and the music is so bad that you have to listen to it to believe it just two short themes seconds long or so are repeated constantly throughout the whole in all one of the worst films i have ever seen
this is minute show about one joke the joke cavemen are not treated fairly hahaha he can't dial a phone because he is a caveman cavemen are not as smart as human beings oh jeez those cavemen are so unsophisticated there is no humor in this show they can only run off this one joke for so long and they already have with the geico commercials this show does not deserve a time slot on national show tries to hard to be funny but it just isn't watching this show i was thinking that it was trying to be like a gone wild show meaning they go to the bar and try to sleep with many women the crying caveman is annoying the caveman with the glasses is too smart to be a all three of them have personalities but i can't figure out why i don't care about them
daniella has some issues brewing under her attractive exterior she starts to lose her mind when she finds out about a distant relative she resembles that was burned for being a werewolf she goes a bit feral when she beads horny men and slashes out their throats she does eventually find a man that helps contain her inner beast but when others ruin their bliss she extracts her violent and furry woman isn't a very goof film but it does pose as a good crowd film a fun time could be had by harping the bad acting dubbing translation and the just plain cheesiness of the production but on own it moves slowly but does have ample nudity to keep you awake barely
your mind will not be satisfied by this doomsday thriller but pray will a youngish couple spends the actual end of the world in the hidden laboratory of some aliens masquerading as church themed outing end of the world has the ingenuity and the lack of both brio and style of the purely similar movies and not only that but eotw plays like a only doomsday but convent creeps as well the villain of the movie is a character wholly shameless slapdash seems a piece of that significantly genre which looks today so amusingly outdated anyway the secret laboratory is some nasty piece of futuristic deco christopher lee is the pride of end of the world but the end of the world is not at all his pride
gadar is a really dumb movie because it tells a fake too unrealistic and is a typical sunny deol movie that is aimed to bash aim is to misguide the viewers so they can think that pakistan and government is bad but trying to hide their own flaws won't all the songs and music of the movie are all likely the sikhs will love th movie cause they are being movie sucks and sucks with power i think only amisha patel was good in the movie if i can give out of i would but the lowest is save hours of your life and do not watch this stupid boring movie disaster
basically a family where a little boy thinks a zombie in his closet his parents are fighting all the movie is slower than a soap opera and suddenly jake decides to become rambo and kill the first of all when you're going to make a film you must decide if its a thriller or a drama as a drama the movie is watchable parents are divorcing arguing like in real life and then we have jake with his closet which totally ruins all the film i expected to see a boogeyman similar movie and instead i watched a drama with some meaningless thriller out of just for the well playing parents descent dialogs as for the shots with jake just ignore them
the worst movie in the history of cinema i don't know if it was trying to be funny or sad poignant or droll but the end result was unwatchable everyone from key grip to robin williams and back down to best boy should be ashamed to be a part of this film
worst mistake of my picked this movie up at target for because i figured hey sandler i can get some cheap laughs i was wrong completely wrong mid-way through the film all three of my friends were asleep and i was still suffering worst plot worst script worst movie i have ever seen i wanted to hit my head up against a wall for an hour then i'd stop and you know why because it felt damn good upon bashing my head in i stuck that damn movie in the microwave and watched it that felt better than anything else i've ever done it took american psycho army of darkness and kill bill just to get over that crap i hate you sandler for actually going through with this and ruining a whole day of my life
two days after seeing this thing i'm still in agony over having seen it so bad you have to wonder how anyone could write this tripe much less allow it to be loose on the general public stilted acting a leading man who looks like sleepwalking and alison eastwood embarrassing herself the action is indicative of low budget movie making which means it is painfully bad the plot well if you were years old then you could have written this movie simplistic idealistic and just plain lame
bad bad bad those three lines sum up this crappy little film that can only attract idiot children and their parents to the cinema and its movie in america what is this country thinking mike myers looking more like micheal jackson some chineese lady that falls asleep within minutes a lame plot with dirty jokes grotesuque and awful when green-eggs and ham comes out in i'll be so happy eddie murphy and tracy morgan will probably play two hipsters trying to find the lost green-eggs and ham they'll try to chase sam-i-am and that mean guy who are running away with it hope they don't ruin the classic book don't waste time and money by seeing this
if you want to see intelligent philosophical discussion of human possibility and potential watch waking life which is brilliant what the do we know is all over the place in its focus poorly directed poorly written poorly acted utterly devoid of any art direction and completely annoying it wasn't thought-provoking or entertaining in the slightest the inclusion of that rambling freak ramtha in this film is reason enough to avoid it isn't it strange how the filmmakers choose to look over the fact that this woman worships some year old atlantian god or something what a flake that old chick is and what a total waste of my time and money this movie was the people responsible for this film should not be allowed to make another movie ever again
its a gem movie if anyone who hasn't seen movie sholey he cant understand what is going on there a thakur call men for catching a big terrorist who is like god and even police don't know abut him but these ppl advantage of film is its speed u never know what is going on and the part is completed actors are at there best of worst acting and actress is here for time-pass of songs and what u cant forget is the cool dialouge which seems to come in very long time but u cant understand them so easily try hard for that and last word i haven't seen movie complete due to a brain roast so plz tell me ditz end if it have
i watched it with my mom and we were the hell we didn't get it at all i may have this wrong but a chair had something to do with the death of this father that movie was terrible this is not a movie for those who love a good suspense movie bad suspense movie cane at i'm never seeing it again and i'm a big fan of lifetime movies too they kinda need to quit trying to make movies outta books driving me whit was butt-ugly and yet she loves him more than hugh who was a tiny bit rating
faces are slashed throats are cut blood squirts and in end the three main characters are either depressed or they die they even blow up kevin dog with a shotgun why would anyone want to see a movie like this violence is valid only when the good guys kill the bad guys not the other way around take for instance underworld and underworld evolution where you can enjoy seeing justice done when the demons are slain in this movie the good guys are cut up see the difference why would anyone want to make a movie that depresses the audience beautiful photography and skilled editing in a motion picture like this is a waste of talent put this one into the category of the exquisite corpse
if you are studying welles and want to see just how far he fell after citizen kane this film will prove it the cheap excuse of making the protagonist a self-admitted dummy to explain how he might fall into such a half-baked scheme fails to explain the absurd courtroom theatrics and ridiculous plot twists that eventually ensue don't be taken in by the high rating of this film in the db as i was all i can guess is that there are a lot of die hard old welles and hayworth fans out there
it is hard to make an unbiased judgment on a film like this that had such an impact on me at such a young age this is with out a doubt the worst kind of exploitation film i was unfortunate enough to see this film for the first time in my youth iwill never forget it i thought it was the most horrible movie ever made i then saw it again earlier this year and was once again am not a zealot or one to say what others should and should not see but i did take great offense to the way in which something as horrible as rape was dealt with in this movie i love lowbrow cinema but this is just plain nasty rent some rus myer instead
while i don't claim to be any sort of expert in marine life i must say anyone with a modicum of intelligence could not possibly buy in to this notion of a whale not even the mother having a clue about revenge because it witnessed his dead mate having a forced abortion by humans i mean really this is basically the whole plot richard harris must have been extremely hard up for roles to have accepted this junk this is the kind of movie that is so bad that if you paid cents to see it you would feel like demanding your money back
hard to criticize this movie because i dislike the story itself and no amount of good acting would have saved it think raising arizona with a mean streak the acting is passable but jennifer tilly is way over the top not enough to make this a nice camp film as usual coming in somewhere between misery and a sarcastic dmv employee the rest of the cast have their brows perpetually knitted in consternation either from the stress of their parts or the stress of the whole futile exercise a real degrading few hours of film darryl hannah spends most of the movie weeping too hard to be understood i wish i could tell you how it ended but i walked out sorry
all internet buzz aside this movie was god awful i expected the movie to be more of a farce than anything instead the film makers tried to make a serious movie and they completely missed there were only a few good parts and a couple good lines by samuel jackson other than that it was a bunch of gore and some poorly animated snakes all of the internet joking was miles better than the actual movie now that the movie has actually come out hopefully this joke will die don't waste your time or money on this piece of over hyped trash if you're looking for something funny and entertaining then just go to snakes on a blog
this is actually an insult to the victims and their families of the btk killer the events in this movie are not even close to the truth why they couldn't make a movie of the real events doesn't make any sense since the real events are more interesting then this made up farce don't even waste your time watching this for free low budget and a shameful depiction of the events which should not be made a joke of which is really what this movie did if they would allow me to give a to this movie i would the acting sucked and it looks like it was shot on an old vhs video camera from the save your time and money by not watching this movie
i have to admit i did not finish this movie because it was so amazingly stupid and not worth watching i watched it with a room full of kids who also were not laughing at the stupid and crude humor the director bob dolman seems to be so obsessed with sphincters and genitalia that it overrides the real story that i grew up with this is not a good film for kids besides the fact that the content is so crude the movie is just stupid has bad flow and has no intelligence behind it what a waste of a perfectly good story if you read the book when you were younger and loved it then don't waste your time watching a movie that so badly botches it that it makes you angry buy your kids the book instead
if you thought that the original from was bad then try out this modern day masterpiece how could it be worse more you ask least in the first one you had ally sheedy jogging in a sports bra other than updated graphics modern day themes as terrorists modern weapons and a sexy new voice for ripley unfortunately this is the same sad tired story anyone that saw the first one could see exactly where the next scene line in the story was going and for anyone that didn't see the first consider yourself lucky that you only watched it once maybe in another years hollywood will try again
this movie is unbelievably ridiculous i love horror movies but this is the worst one i've ever seen i am a huge fan of gore but most of the deaths in this movie aren't shown it just shows us the already dead bodies and the only death scenes that they actually show in this movie are terrible the graphics look so obviously fake the actors are awful as well there is no real emotion from any of them not only did i waste my time watching this piece of movie but i had to subject myself to actual footage of animals being beaten during the beginning of it if i could rate this a i would this movie crap watch it
i wouldn't say this is a movie unfortunately for me i get the feeling that the more you know about fencing the worse it gets simply due to the fact that it becomes totally unrealistic i've been fencing since i was years old and this movie portrays it very poorly f murray abraham is good appears to have some fencing background but most of the other the seem to be lost
i figured the whole joke of the movie would be to see some rich white guy acting like chris rock and then see chris rock react to reactions instead you just see chris rock being himself and people not understanding him there are maybe scenes in the entire movie where they use their gimmick this should have been a lot better
i saw tv series and the ago and never was fond of the show very you're a fan of this if i'm spoiling it for this is actually what i of people liked i school kids characters seemed to fought all the arther and were nice to each other gradually i got tired of complaining attitude towards everyone and his sister the name was dw was an sister of arthur who was sometimes could be why arthur got annoyed with what her routines her imaginary friend and her stuffed animal collection friends acted like teenagers instead of what they were like in the arthur the didn't care very greatest cartoon was modern offense
i've been reading posts here concerning wonder costume for this tv movie it should be pointed out at the time the movie was made she wasn't wearing her traditional outfit the producers were actually sticking to the comic book conception of ww for the early for the movie itself i have to agree with many of the other posters here snoozefest i was a kid when it appeared on abc in so i was at the right age to have appreciated a movie about a comic book hero yet i was so engrossed with the plot i stopped watching it three quarters into the course i wasn't at the right age to appreciate cathy lee
ice-t stars as mason a homeless african-american who finds himself hunted by wealthy hunters s dutton mcnamara and john c mcginley however mason proves to be much harder prey then the usual targets in this ridiculous and slow paced actioner which takes too long setting up actionscenes and then totally botching them
quite possibly the worst movie that i have ever seen when has hollywood ever made a successful movie that attacked republicans why don't they learn the dixie chicks haven't these lefties live in their own elite bubble interacting among themselves oblivious to the fact that most of america is much further right than they best hollywood productions are not partisan and are rarely political at imitation of cheney was would have thought cussack could have landed better wasn't funny
okay first off voice is dubbed over for like of the film why because apparently there were rewriting the script and story as they were shooting and they need to change his dialogue for story continuity as they have multiple versions from the very beginning you just scratch your head because the overdubs are not only distracting but they make no said the story still sucked and doesn't make any sense at all when i got the the end i was just scratching my head cause the movie was so pointless and the ending didn't even make like the plague this movie made me stop watching seagal straight to video movies cause they just get worse and worse
awful simply awful it proves my theory about star power this is supposed to be great tv because the guy who directed titanica is the same guy who directed this shlop schtock schtick about a chick b o r i n something a thousand times more interesting to do like watch your tv with no picture and no sound rated it so high there aren't any negative scores in the rating my theory about star power is the more star power used in a show the weaker the show is called an indirect proportionality quality power less sp makes for better quality etc another way to look at it is more is
clearly rips off hideo ringu and hongurai mizu no soko kara water with hints of ju-on grudge but atrociously done gore green corpse with red eyes weak story and a weak theme find it very difficult to find a picture message scary there were two moments in this film that made me shudder both involving an unexpected hand and after oodishon miike takashi one this one from had me tingling all over for hours after seeing it and all of the films this steals from were actually scary i can't see this film as anything other than a sell-out to the western popularity of the big japanese horror films two out of ten
this film is about a group of extra terrestrial gay black men exterminating females on earth in order to create a gay watched it with the intent of seeing how bad it was still i was shocked at how bad it was it looked more like a film made years ago the acting if any is ultra bad the sets and props are so ridiculously fake making any college film look mega budget and the special effects are laughably simple indeed jaw dropping as others have commented but jaw droppingly has to be severely intoxicated or in an altered state of consciousness in order to appreciate this film if i was from denmark i would be severely embarrassed and humiliated that my countrymen produced such a horrifyingly bad film
ninteen eighty-four is a film about a futuristic society in which the government controls everything and no one can be trusted it is a very dark film and it is one that will not make you feel good about yourself it is about a romance taking place in this society and the betrayal of the lovers and about human nature being self-centred the film has some very good ideas and is done well in portraying this society with the dark tones in colours with happiness and bright colours in the dreams and a general feeling of loneliness through objects and people and places however despite the cleverness at portraying this idea the film was very slow and did not seem to quite get the idea across it seemed to spend too much time being clever rather than telling a story
i think everyone was quite disappointed with this sci-fi flick for one thing it was directed by tim burton another thing a remake of what is supposed to be a classic i found it boring gross and ridiculous if you've seen it you know what i mean just about everyone at imdb say crap and boy are they right if you haven't avoid it a snorer out of
i love the comics although i do have problems fully understanding the stories the visual style is unique with all its dirt dust and decay so i thought i knew what i was up for surprisingly i understood the main plot but some extremely poorly decisions where made for its visual style mean really bad looking cg human close ups why it did not work at all horus and the other egyption gods was successfully made in cg and very close to the comic version think with real actors this movie could have been a cult movie a shame
despite being a sequel to the more potent original this is more of a comical remake of friday the concerning the further antics of psychopathic angela killing more nubile teens for their immorality at a springsteen of bruce looks great there are some pretty darn funny sex scenes with some pretty darn attractive girls but the so comedic rather than suspenseful a out of rated r for graphic violence and gore nudity and for some sexuality language and drug use
another horror flick in which a goof-ball teenager battles a madman and his supernatural sidekick who want to take over yes but the fact that this one was from canada gives it a slightly different feel the brain has troublesome teenager jim majelewski getting put into a treatment whose leader turns out to be a cult leader aided by a big ugly brain can jim stop him i guess that since our northern neighbor has accomplished all that they have accomplished they're entitled to make at least one ridiculous horror movie but still they'll probably want to be known for having national health care and bad guy had a brain why didn't the people who made this movie
this has been put out on the dvd market by alpha and for die-hard boris karloff fans moi only not a horror flick but a drama where boris is a struggling scientist agreeing to kill a wealthy husband in order to gain the fortune needed to continue with his work but once the dying victim changes his will and leaves his spouse nothing all hell breaks appeasing enough seeing karloff as another selfish sinister type and some of the acting is unintentionally hilarious from the leading lady mona goya who is absolutely a laugh riot as the double-crossed proceed with much caution
let me start out by saying that i used to really like betty grable particularly from down argentine way but by the time she got around to this disaster she had also got round and frankly the whole film was an embarrassment costarred with douglas fairbanks jnr must have been fairly desperate the story was bad the colours good and the film far too long it had some of the old standbys in it like harry davenport and reginald gardiner to try and stimulate interest but with no success the music score was woeful and i have to say not one tune was memorable in any i was such a fan of miss grable i always wish i had never seen this one
there may something poetically right in seeing dentists suffer suffer they do in this dreary truly dreadful film but they cause the audience to undergo pain of the non-dental variety too if you ever wanted to see a movie full of screaming kids barfing kids sick kids lots of long long meaningful glances a deadpan wife and a concerned husband all here for you boring overlong it stands out as one of those examples that scream out why is there a saving grace yes there is there is a short scene from nabucco with some pretty good singing save your money or if on tv or cable save your time you can always read a book or make an omelette
there is so much that is wrong with this film but to sum it up terrible so bad it must have been on purpose poor script they may have had some good ideas but this was not the best way to present the story ridiculously bad in some cases the ending manages to save the film-not in this case if you manage to sit through the entire film you will want to kick yourself at the end because the ending is not even worth waiting for this is the worst film i have seen in a long time it was complete torture sitting through this film i would have appreciated someone warning me in advance so do yourself a favor watch this film only if you have absolutely nothing better to do even then you will regret having put yourself through the unspeakable torture
in all of low budget history this movie has to be one of the worst true ther are some humorous sides to the movie but in general it was just plain awful i just can't understand what person could not out run a bunch of slugs i mean they have to be one of the slowest creatures on the planet the only part worth while in this movie is the close up of a slugs attempt to bite the finger of a man this was rather amusing
sky captain and the world of tomorrow amazingly incovenient title is simply a bad movie it has no heart no deep ideas nothing very special about it yes the cgi backgrounds look interesting but the result is that the whole thing is shot in an annoying soft focus additionally the movie uses music the same way as say island or the scooby-doo it never stops terribly simply terrible there are no fresh ideas either just gobs and gobs and gobs and etc of bits taken from older movies and serials there is no gatekeeper here the movie just seems to exist because it can save your money and your time not entertaining at all
oh dear me rarely has a horror film bored me or made me laugh as much as this one after a spirited start with an intriguing premise it descends into not much more than a slasher flick with some supernatural and sexual asides the usually excellent alice krige is wasted in this one and the plot twists are ludicrous don't bother unless you're really desperate rating
this is one of the most insipid lackluster unoriginal and pointless movies ever made it almost feels like everyone involved in this project didn't even try to make an appealing movie this is nothing more than a continuation of a tiresome series of films that attempt to cash in on the success of smokey and the bandit which i think is the best film of them all as for this waste of film stock burt reynolds sleepwalks his way through the entire movie jim nabors is wasted the other actors aren't given very much to do the car races are obviously stock footage the humor is uninspired and many of the scenes are more dull and lifeless than staring at a wall for two hours stroker ace is simply a superfluous film with nothing unique or distinctive about it
i've been going through the list of the top comedies and i must say that this is truly one of the worst not just of the movies on the list i've seen but of any movie i've ever seen drunks are funny sometimes dudley isn't liza almost made it worthwhile but alas just go watch arrested development if you want to see her in something good seriously dudley laughing and drinking is supposed to be funny i would highly recommend almost any other movie on the top comedies for more laughs than this if you want to see a funnier drunk try the thin man funnier movie in general any marx brothers movie will kill if you're as drunk as arthur
this is by the far worst piece of i've ever seen in my life it barely made sense it wasn't scary at all you class scary as loud noises and screaming sarah-michelle gellar needs to stop with these horror films i think everyone else in the cinema agreed with me when i shouted shite when the credits rolled up my list of the worst movies ever made this is how it would the return cabin fever silent reason i made silent hill is because it showed some frightening scenes but the rest was absolute same with cabin fever made no sense but the return topped that list its worse than silent hill and cabin fever put together
john heder was absolutely horrendous in this movie i felt like i was watching a bad college kid act for the first time in a student film anna farris was par for the course not good but not horrible cute dianne keaton should have known better jeff daniels was the only saving grace in this movie though it was poor judgement on his part as well in all i would avoid this at all costs i'm just glad i didn't pay to see it heder will forever be stuck in the typecast role of the dorky kid unless he does some serious work on his acting chops
i have never panned a film on-line but i felt moved to do so after seeing this one one doesn't show up at funeral and say to the bereaved my relatives died so why should i care about the propaganda there was little if anything that could be called art as the daughter of deaf parents i was particularly annoyed by the use of deafness as a gimmick any deaf person feeling a vibration of that immensity would likely have investigated not ignored word chutzpah comes to mind as a writer there are few subjects i would stay away from the holocaust is one this is another i wish these movie makers had not been so arrogant inept
well since seeing through i can honestly say that they should have never made part everything from the tacky and i do mean tacky score to the really bad acting i dare anyone to watch this and not be bored out of their mean parts to kept the vibe strong on the plot of damion but without him around in this one just not the same sure by the end of part i was getting a little tired of the continued story but it was a good closure at the end of the third one again there was no reason for a part even if there was they could have done a much better job than this i had to sit through lol there goes an hour and a half of my life i'll never see again
this had a great cast with big-name stars like tyrone power henry fonda randolph scott nancy kelly henry hull and brian donlevey and a bunch more lesser-but-known names with shorter roles it also had technicolor one of the few movies made with it in the bad i can't say much positive for the story it portrayed the james boys in a totally positive hollywood has done that ever since why these criminals are always shown to be the good guys is beyond me this film glamorizes them and made their enemies the railroad people into vicious human beings the latter was exaggerated so much it was preposterous well the film world for you evil is good good is hollywood a news flash the james boys were criminals really look it up
this rubbish excuse for television is the single most god-awful piece of trash ever to hit australian television the house-mates are dull uninteresting ridiculously unintelligent and are picked on the basis that you would be likely to attempt to murder them if you had to live with them as far as i am concerned big brother is the decline of western society showing how us as a society are on a steep slope to becoming brain-dead morons whatever happened to television that didn't target the lowest common denominator of society as an audience this cannot be classified as entertainment i think that it true that channel ten can remove your soul it happened to rove mcmanus who was once a respectable comedian and once moving to channel become horribly unfunny with the exception of the simpsons which is highly intelligently made
a routine concerning a killer that lurks in the swamps during the early days of television this one was shown so often when dad would say on tv tonight and we'd tell him strangler of the swamp he'd pack us off to the movies we went to the movies a lot in those days
as i am from hungary i have heard many people saying better and better things about √ºvegtigris so far but actually i don't understand the reason of all the liked many points of the movie some of the quotes really cheered me up but the stereotyped characters are present again like in every hungarian film and the story is also pretty dull i liked the first half but then i started to get bored and then i found the whole film just p√©ter is good as always reviczky is brilliant also but the others are just there doing many years still have to pass for a good hungarian film
movie sucks big time it reminded me of the movie resurrection lambert which i also found extremely boring and semana santa is in every way an even poorer fine one in the cast doing something for this movie is alida valli alida is one of the grand old ladies in european movie history i loved her maniacal looks in suspiria and inferno argento i will not spend more time dealing with this movie i will say another good thing about this it if you want to fall asleep very quickly
encouraged by the positive comments about this film on here i was looking forward to watching this film bad mistake i've seen films and this is truly one of the worst of them awful in almost every way editing pacing storyline acting soundtrack only song a lame country tune is played no less than four times the film looks cheap and nasty and is boring in the extreme rarely have i been so happy to see the end credits of a film only thing that prevents me giving this a is harvey keitel while this is far from his best performance he at least seems to be making a bit of an effort one for keitel obsessives only
way to go ace you just made a chilling grossly intriguing story of a necrophiliac cannibal into a soft mellow drama obviously a movie called dahmer would be one of two kinds horror or documentary right this was neither it wasn't close to any detailed facts fact it barely had any substance at all it wasn't really morbid or scary or didn't even try to be very if you would've had to try what the hell was this thinking one of the most real examples of sick serial killers ever and we get badly shot poorly acted gay bar roofie rapes and lengthy droning flashbacks to alone time in his old house i think jacobson was actually trying to present invent the soft side of
not only did they get the characters all wrong not only do the voices suck not only do the writers seriously need to get girlfriends not only are the drawings really crude but it seems like it was mainly created for ages the only episode i've ever seen of this show that kept me watching was a mattter of family because i liked the robin character and sometimes i think just a general copy of batman the animated series example in btas bruce is friends with harvey dent yeah over a two episode story he transforms into the unlikely villain twoface in the show bruce is friends with that ethan guy and over a two episode story he transforms into the unlikely villain clayface that was just a small example may not even be true but in short this is the worst attempt on a batman series and saying something
as i sat subjected to this televised mediocrity i wondered why why did dianne keaton agree to this trash the movie uses meaningless contrived plot lines to deliver trash to homes of thousands the movie takes a political agenda to a new level the movie was meaningless and all creditability was lost to the excessive use of stereotype was obvious that keaton tried to make this movie worthwhile but in the end she needs to remember the age old adage that you cannot polish a turd i hope that you did not waste your new day watching another mindless made for tv movie i now know why the networks started airing series on sunday night to rid us of trash
love tim roth i really do and he does his best with an unbelievable role i can see how this is a movie that might look good as a script but convoluted unlikely and ultimately silly i saw the fake death ending coming a mile away rene z tries hard with an underwritten part and so does patricia arquette the detective whose name i can't remember one not chris penn is a big sweaty over actor see it if you're not smart enough to differentiate between a movie being so clever you can't follow it and so confusing you can't understand it see it if you like cheesy camera work that makes you seasick see it if you love to watch tim roth work with an unwieldy script see it if it comes on late at night for free otherwise rent the usual suspects
this was the worst movie i have ever seen molly hall could not act at all she had no emotion it was all blah blah blah like she was reading out of a boring text book the smart kid and the kid who loves food names weren't worth remembering were so annoying it drove me ever the talked it was about some scientific thing or food mollys dad didn't show enough emotion about his daughter missing the police officer and mollys dad said the same thing like four times it was just horrible everything was repeated way to much beatrice should have had something bad happen to her for being so mean i just wasted a moment in my life by watching this movie
i think the croc hunter is a pretty cool guy i know i wouldn't have the nerve to go even feet away from a everything in this movie is bad farting jokes people getting eaten and the skit about the president all make the movie one of the worst of all a really bad film that you have to stay away from all the jokes are so juvenile that you will find yourself laughing because they are so stupid the plot is so bad that you wonder if the screenwriter is years surprised the croc hunter did not beg the crocodile to eat him after he saw this
this is the biggest flop of i don know what director has is his mind of creating such a big disaster the songs have been added without situations the story have been stretched to fill the hrs gap and most disgusting are the action stunts performed by the actors like everyone are having superpowers they can run in between the bullets are fire and nothing happens to them and one person fighting with people only the best performance was by anil kapoor man he is all time at his best playing the role of villain with a comic act speaking hinglish akki is also done a good job but the movieee just forget it
a decent sequel but does not pack the punch of the original a murderous new identities in order to direct his own novel cabin by the lake still ruthless killing but movie seems very tongue-in-cheek any humor is not of the funny kind total project seems to have the quality of a quickie and at times nelson is way over the top this movie is about a script being rewritten before going to the should have happened to this script
i have never seen a comedy that was this much of a chore to sit one laugh in it ok maybe one little chuckle for the michael clarke duncan bit as the big black bald gay virgin but the rest of it was shockingly un-funny on top of being void of any laughs the skits go on forever steer clear of this one if you value your time and money dreadful the worst
seriously what the hell was this movie give it is the lowest you can this movie is not worth of time i don't know what the hell is wrong with you guys voting this movie out of seriously can make a better movie than this hire some other unemployed i promise i'll make a movie better than movie was so i'll never watch a movie starring steve carrel line don't waste your time to download it off the net or rent nominate this movie for the worst movie of the century i mean the worst is something gotta give but after that this is the second
shown in australia as hydrosphere this incredibly bad movie is so bad that you become hypnotised and have to watch it to the end just to see if it could get any worse and it does the storyline is so predictable it seems written by a high school dramatics class the sets are pathetic but marginally better than the miniatures and the acting is infant muppet seems to have been stolen from the props cupboard of total recall there didn't seem to be a single original idea in the whole found this movie to be so bad that i laughed most of the way mcdowell should hang his head in shame he obviously needed the money
start with the script i have seen cartoons with more depth than envy anytime characters keep repeating what you have already seen and was not funny the first time a movie is in deep trouble which envy certainly is a movie that relies on one joke had better have somewhere to go with it here we have a film that goes absolutely nowhere christopher walken especially would like to forget this bomb because his character is so weak ben stiller has been in some pretty good black comedies flirting with disaster and duplex immediately come to mind be certain that envy is not a black comedy there are no double meanings just total nonsense envy deserves low rating because like subject matter it stinks merk
this film features two of my favorite guilty pleasures sure the effects are laughable the story confused but just watching hasselhoff in his knight rider days is always fun i especially like the old hotel they used to shoot this in it added to what little suspense was mustered give it a
this movie was just terrible the first movie wasn't that great i mean ridiculously stupid if they didn't have enough with the first films you had to add another one why just not make this into an ongoing series like james bond i'll tell you exactly why because the bond films are actually very very good and these films just stink i don't understand was this supposed to be a cross between to genres like horror and comedy for goodness sakes my year old niece wouldn't be scared of such a ridiculous attempt at horror a spit in the face of people who at least want to be scared at some point in a so called horror film please no more of these movies
this movie is most possibly the worst movie i have ever see in my entire life the plot is ridiculous and the whole little man crap is just so stupid the entire movie is unrealistic and dumb face it just a black comedy this is just a pointless horrible piece that should have never made it to theaters the jokes are not funny and the acting is horrendous please i beg of to you save your money than see this worthless piece of crap i had to endure sitting through little man for an hour and a half wishing my eyes would bleed i am disgusted that something like this would even be thought of who writes this crap the actors have no talent what so ever how do these people get into hollywood they are making money off this junk
the original movie dated not show any monster it just suggested scary things version however shows every aspect of a sick minded ghost including unnecessary special effects mystery as presented in the original movie was the most scary part one simply did not know what was causing the weird things that happened by showing the face of the old man this mister has completely disappeared even worse the special effects crying wooden children faces is ridiculous this is a stupid remake too obviously spectacular to even be close as scary as the original
i never much liked the myra movie tho i appreciate how it pushed the hollywood envelope at the time certainly miss costume became an iconic image though i have to wonder if many people who recognize the image really saw the film and know what it was all about rewatched myra on fmc a couple of years ago and didn't think it had aged any better thru the years a segment about it in the sexploitation cinema cartoon history comic books where given proper credit for putting such big stars in what was then an outrageous production however imho the movie is too bitter to be charming too silly to be a turn-on and so busy trying to shock that it fails to inform engage or entertain
if somebody wants to make a really really bad movie wizards of the lost kingdom really sets a yardstick by which to measure the depth of with the pseudo-chewbacca that follows around the main character some poor schmuck in a baggy white furry costume that looks as if it was stitched together from discarded pieces of carpeting work your way slowly painfully through more not-so-special effects that thoroughly deny the viewer from suspension of disbelief add a garden gnome for the heck of second thought skip this movie entirely and find something else to do for an hour and a half
wow ironic since this movie has been out for awhile i think that someone else just reviewed it a couple days i watched this movie simply because it has nick stahl for the movie was ridiculous the characters drove me insane they were so clich√© and stereotyped this movie had some of the worst dialogue i have ever heard it had way too many plot twists is one scene in the movie worth seeing however the scene warm heart cold gun where nick stahl kills the obnoxious girl in the shower actually they were all obnoxious but his acting in that scene was excellent the look on his face it reminded my of american psycho good movie the scene is worth seeing but not worth seeing the rest of the movie for do yourself a favor and don't watch it
i loved dewaere in series noir his talent is trivialized in the waltzers aka going places okay a couple of guys flaunting convention in the most absurd and irredeemable ways many folks find such behavior amusing this was a boring pointless exercise designed to shock i find the smirk on face the face behind the camera annoying series noir was a valid expression of personal liberty and licentious behavior from the first moment when we see patric dewaere prancing in the abandoned lot we get an idea of the bewilderingly beautiful anti-hero we'll be spending time with for the next couple of hours when we see him chasing the hapless middle aged female with his buddy depardieu in going places we have fair warning that two hours spent with these chaps will be soul-draining i have trouble eking even a for this annoying distraction
film gets a out this has to be one of the worst films i have seen in years not only was the acting incredibly bad the storyline you can call it that was just as bad offcourse everyone knows going to happen within the first minutes which is not a bad thing if you can captivate the audience during leading up to that moment that however is not the case there is no action no suspense not even a spark between the leading actors it was unfortunately a waste of my time and certainly a waste of my money the of merely for trying
i have grown up pouring over the intertwined stories of the wrinkle in time chronicles my dream was that one day a screenwriter would come across their child sitting in a large sofa reading a winkle in time and would think what an amazing movie this would make sadly enough that screenwriter failed changing characters throwing in lame humor and all out destroying the plot i know that it is a hard task to change a well loved novel into a movie but why can't you stay true to the book why must you change the way characters think and act for those of you who have not read the book pick it up find a soft couch and let your imagination run wild
this movie is truly awful after seeing the advertisement for it i thought it could have its charms but it girls cannot act and they cannot sing either the soundtrack to this movie is full of their songs and its not a pretty sight terrible story line unbelievable plot its one of worst movies by far ally is not a bad actress on phil of the future so i don't know what happened in cow belles and her sister aj seems to be just hitching a ride on her sisters fame and she displays no talent what so the end of the movie the girls do finally learn some clich√© morals but this is to late to rescue this train wreck
i've now just realised that by watching this film i have lost valuable precious moments of my life i will never get back thsi film isn't just poor its dire it reminded me of every stereotypical black sitcom ever regret watching this reckons its a race issue apparently white people don't like it because it doesn't have white actors mate i think you'll find the reason why no one liked this was because watching paint dry is far more entertaining and funnier then this pile of stop making crap films
live a little love a little is one of elvis weirdest movies part slapstick part fluff part surreal and part strange elvis meets up with a very off-beat girl with an annoying voice she looks like jennifer aniston story doesn't make much sense as is the case with most elvis presley movies and there a bunch of odd characters galore not much music in this one but what there is i liked although none are memorable strange continuity elvis and michelle carey go into her beach house at night but a few minutes later a delivery boy comes in and stark daylight what about the essence of the movie what oh two good things about the movie a elvis looks great and b the dog steals the show
corridors of time the movie you can watch if you're looking for a sophisticated way of suicide some use guns ropes or gas but you want to ruin your brains do not wait any longer corridors of time is probably one of the biggest possible mistakes thinking christian clavier is able to act and to bring you fun i do not miss the francs this poor thing cost me sometimes one has to reset its evaluation system looking at the absolute zero this film deserves a but only because i like jean reno too bad for him he also stars in ronin i think i'm gonna dislike him
i only saw this movie once and that was enough for me the movie has very little if any plot and seems to be nothing but continuous scenes of psycho-sadistic violence and very little of anything else i wanted to see this movie because it starred zoe trilling of the second night of the demons and i wanted to see her playing someone normal unfortunately the tobe hooper script barely begins and goes nowhere as robert englund dominates the film and chews up the scenery and plot zoe i know where you are now hiding from this film
after the already disappointing final conflict the series hits rock-bottom with this very weak fourth entry at least the third film tried to continue the story of damien while this one simply rehashes and copies ideas from the omen are afraid of the antichrist the death of one man is very similar to the death of the photographer in the first film but what looked exciting and creative there looks just dumb here and the little girl looks simply like a spoiled kid
this film is so bad it simply defies reality the filming is grade school material at best the acting is pathetic and the director should forever be banished from film making in any form so bad it can't even be watched as comedy such something along the lines of showgirls the only thing this dvd had going for it was the cover art i can write to those of you who haven't had the misfortune to witness this is to please do yourself a well deserved favor in advance and don't waste your time or your money on this piece of garbage if you want to see a movie for the comedy aspects there are many other more worthy in such a realm than this trash
i didn't know what to expect from the film well now i know this was a truly awful film the screenplay directing and acting were equally bad the story was silly and stupid the director could have made a smart and thought provoking film but he didn't i squirmed in my seat for the last half of the movie because it was so bad where was the focus to the film where was anything in this film christians should boycott this film instead of promoting it it was shabbily done and a waste of my money do not see this film
this movie frequently extrapolates quantum mechanics to justify nonsensical ideas capped by such statements like we all create our own folks reality is what true for all of us not just the idea that possible doesn't hold water on closer examination if possible contrary things are thus possible and so possible this leads to postmodernistic nonsense which is nothing less than an attempt to denigrate established truths so that all ideas well-founded and stupid are quote sci-fi writer philip k dick who put it so well reality is that which when you stop believing in it doesn't go away
robert forster normally a very strong character actor is lost at sea here cast as a new york family man seeking revenge on the thugs who murdered his son and attacked his wife in a home invasion scary subject matter exploited for cheapjack thrills in the death wish vein it isn't difficult to scoff at these smarmy proceedings the dialogue is full of howlers the crime statistics are irrevocably dated and the supporting characters are ridiculously over-written a despicable judge who allows an accused murderer to walk right out of the courtroom low-rent production is contemptible in its self-righteousness especially as the violence in our cities has only increased from
what are people on here talking about i must have seen a different movie than you guys i was so bored that i walked out of the theater what is up with this stuff i only laughed once and not even that hard whoever greenlit this movie should be taken out into the street and beaten i usually always find something i like in a movie but this is crazy slackers makes not another teen movie look like a classic it ranks up there with such trash as body shots con air and conspiracy theory as one of the worst of all time avoid at all costs i thought the studio would be handing out money to people as they left the theater as a sign of their apologies but to my dismay that wasn't happening looks like i will never see that money again or the two hours
i saw this movie twice i can't believe pintilie made such a fantasy movie i'm also a director and i know what i speak this is not romania anymore but i see the events are happening in the same period with the incident from september no story no plot nothing no conclusion no message nothing profound nothing hidden just empty most of romanians don't know this movie is for the french viewers not for us they really believe that is the reality in romania also for teenagers pintilie should stop making movies i don't really know if we can call this a movie maybe a horror and we wonder why we've got such an image in europe this was a reality but isn't anymore a good friend of mine from the brithish embassy said you have no idea what a long way romanian people walked from ceausescu
if it smells like garbage and if it looks like garbage it must be garbage this is by far one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my entire life tony poor directing style puts shame to an already uninteresting and slightly untrue story of domino life as a bounty hunter the story is completely discontinuous and confusing to watch certain aspects of the plot were ridiculous and totally unbelievable it seems that all of the action scenes were loosely strung together by poor plot points and horrible acting keira knightley does get totally naked in this one though that is the one and only upside to this film if you want to see her naked just fast forward the movie until about an hour and a half into it and you'll catch a whole lot of nipple i strongly suggest that no one see this movie
this movie was not very entertaining certainly no where as original or as good as a christmas story the characters the youngest try to emulate the preceding actors and they fail the hillbilly neighbors come out of nowhere as they weren't a part of the first movie this really sucked might have been good with the original cast then again maybe not because the story is so weak skip it
i thought hedy burress managed to escape from the watery grave of part one was going to be in part guess not i just think they should of killed her off like in friday the part know what i movie like scream and urban legend followed movies within a was pure crap the whole movie within a movie stay away
this could be a strong candidate for the worst flick ever perhaps without the presence of john hurt it could be tolerated as a kid-film however the tragedy of this entire endeavor is that john hurt one of the greatest actors diminishes himself in gave it two points just because mr hurt showed take away points because he didn't run from it fast enough as far as the rest of the cast they are simply terrible janine turner as pretty as she might be cannot act to save her soul and the lead actor is for all intents and purposes awful if you can spare yourself this embarrassment please do so so bad it almost hurts
this film was pure pain sitting in the theater for x-amount of minutes i was wondering when the film was going to start all the setups were in place typical love story characters have to overcome their short-givings villain has to emerge but none of it ever initiated by the time these things happened i was already bored stiff and the devices were completely ineffective in scenes that required immense tension and buildup it felt like necessary frames were cut stuff does not have to be this way films can be as riveting and engaging as adult ones the excuse hey its for kids is bull i'll take sword in the stone any day this was terrible i'm getting the feeling that disney will put out anything these days and as for the kids the i saw this with will trash
this movie fails miserably on every level i have an idea take everyone involved in this movie and ship them into a hot zone in the middle east maybe if we're lucky they'll all be shot and killed and we won't have to ever have our time wasted by them again did i mention that i have never been so bitter about a cinematic pile of crap in my entire life my god i can't think of anything i've ever seen that was this bad i'd rather watch ishtar times in a row than sit through minutes of this sorry excuse for a film if i ever happen to meet anyone who was involved in this film i'll spit in their face and then beat them senseless my two cents
this film was screen as part of the sydney mardi gras film festival i had no expectation of the film as someone else choose it for actually like films that take time to develop films that allow the characters to unfold and lets the story flow stillness is good but this film though was just plain must go to the two main actors there was a sense of tension between them as two totally different people misfits really come together in a very awkward way there were tender moments and sadness as we learned more about also liked the setting and the way it was shot it was claustrophobic and monochrome and it added to the intimacy and reinforces the oddness of the just don't understand the ending what was the point of it all
this warning against anti-semitism is well-meant and may have had its purpose at the time but it is made without the slightest notion of how to make a film the director has no idea about mise-en-scene the cast varies from bad till even great austrian comic hans moser is wasted in his part he ends in an asylum for the crazy that is designed as a set from das kabinett des dr caligari one wonders whether the makers had all their mental restored copy i saw filmmuseum gives the impression that some scenes were not put into the right place but may be the original editing was bad as well
someone had a great idea have misty mundae do her own r-rated version of lara croft firing two guns not only in skimpy outfits but topless as well it was indeed a great idea the problem is that the people who had it couldn't come up with any sort of script or budget to support it therefore we get a film that barely reaches medium length by replaying many of its parts in slow-motion and was apparently shot entirely inside a garage the appeal of misty mundae is still evident she is unbelievably cute and has a natural girl-next-door beauty however her two female co-stars here with whom she shares a lengthy lesbian scene are nowhere near her league if mummy raider was presented as a youtube video i'd rate it higher but as a film destined for dvd consumption it cannot get more than a out of
whoever gave this movie rave reviews needs to see more loser takes his camera and photographs his mental family the movie is filled with idiots and includes live teabagging that should sum it all up for not waste your time you may want to watch the entire movie in the hopes that it gets better as it goes on it doesn't
seemingly intended to be a thriller of a movie winds up being almost laughable it prompted me to exclaim oh my god more than once at the convoluted contrivances of plot that were just plain or absurd locations just for the sheer novelty or dramatic situation and improbable near impossible human reactions and circumstances are too much to be comprehended as to why they you have the time and wish to discover just how bad a picture can be then you will want to see this one otherwise dedicate some time into watching some paint dry for a more productive investment of a film released in is already being shown on tv in july might give an indication of the quality
this movie was but it could have been much better there are some spooky moments but there aren't enough of them to make me ever want to see this movie again there are some scenes you could fast forward through not miss anything the biggest flaw is that it is so predictable that is the reason why i rated it so low watchable but don't expect anything great
ok we all love the daisy dukes but what is up with this cast lets start jessica simpson as daisy there is not one thing country about this girl and daisy was not ditzy uncle jesse was probably the closest one to resemble the original no offense to burt but i never noticed boss hog being so tall that was part of the humor of boss hog was his size did they even try someone like danny devito ok now get this they cast jessica simpson did anyone take a look at her husband he matches luke duke to a tee cleary these producers did not look at the appearance of the old cast members the screen were never present on the dukes this made the movie a turn off from the beginning i give this a huge thumbs down
i have to say this is one of the worst films i've ever seen they had a pretty good storyline to go on but than the messed it up so badly first of all the cast is all wrong where did that van actor btw and puff daddy come from it looks like carlito has come from the hood and used to hang about with some real idiots this film doesn't do carlitos way any justice im so happy that the sequel way came out first if i had seen this rubbish first i would have never given the pacino version a chance and anyway pacino is supposed to have read this story thought crap and did the sequel instead way rise to power out of way out of
words fail me this film was extremely difficult to watch and in hindsight i really wish i hadn't done it although i attempted to sit through it until the end credits i have to admit i couldn't last for more than hour so my opinion could be unfair however this film would require the most impressive final third in the history of film-making in order for it to be given a review which is anything but do not watch any part of this film
after being bitten by a bat in a doctor named john beck undergoes an accelerating transformation into a man-bat wife assures him that nothing wrong with all just due to rabies or the anti-rabies drugs local cop thinks that john is responsible for several gruesome bat people by jerry jameson is one hell of a horrible script is deadly dull and there is no gore nor pointless piece of crap is so mind-numbingly boring that you'll scratch your head in a total disbelief after suffering through the design of a man-bat creature by a young stan winston is completely pathetic and this stinker like the out of
this very unfunny failed tv pilot can be found as an extra on the annivesery dvd special edition blazing saddles imagine the movie without the satire humor or writing skills but with all the trappings of a typical lame sit-com show complete with obtrusive laugh track and you'll still have no clue how sheer putrid this failed show was what the hell was lou gossett jr thinking when he signed onto this disaster this was possibly the worst thing been in yes i'm including the first punisher movie and iron eagles steve landesberg i understand as he can't say no to grade f
i watched this movie for its two hours and have absolutely no idea what about somebody got murdered or maybe they didn't and maybe somebody did it or maybe they didn't this brought back memories of the good old days old days when all cbc canadian movies were stinkers lately stinkers have been the exception but this confused hodge podge of trendy feminism mind reeling flash backs and mumbled dialogue makes up for lost time i've never found margaret books easy to read this movie continues that fine canadian tradition it isn't easy to watch maybe the trendy folks at the chi chi toronto cocktail parties will pretend they liked it us folks in the boonies are a little less pretentious
if it wasn't for the performances of barry diamond and art evans as the clueless stoners i would have no reason to recommend this to plot centers around a year high school reunion which takes place in a supposed abandon high more like a prop from a low budget horror flick and the deranged student the class pulled a very traumatizing prank on this student desires to kill off the entire class for hughes falls in love with his characters too much as only one student is killed as well as the lunch anne ramsey we're led to believe that the horny coupled gets killed but never see a blasted thing this is a horrible movie that continued national downward spiral throughout the and
i've seen a lot of seagal movies and while most aren't great or even good this steamy pile lowered the bar for bad plot not sure really something about a drug that makes you all crazy and strong or something who are the good guys and bad guys hard to tell most of the movie is cut scenes going back and forth between people in darkly lit rooms complaining about how good seagals character mashall dubbing what was with the horrible voice overdubbing could they of found anyone who sounded any less like seagal may as well had cheech or chong doing the voice overs might of at least been entertaining movie is boring and completely stupid avoid it at all costs
im watching it now on pink tv station and i must say this is a crap shallow no acting effects too sloppy i mean who made this was a stupid attempt of the studios to make some more money on the success of the film ok the film was great in when it came out but the times you can see how idiotic the lines are in the speech of the characters i mean did they actually pay someone to write that was that someones relative at the studio this is no film was the bomb the series suck
why oh why don't blockbuster movies simply stick to their selling point everyone in the cinema young and old was there to see talking animals make jokes and whilst they did that we were all happy and then as with lost in space came the two killer blows plot and sentiment who really cared what happened to the tiger or whether eddie murphy made up with his daughter not me for sure
the fine cast cannot uplift this routine tale of a secretary murdered by her married paramour in fact there are more questions than answers in this one-sided tale of romance and murder and since we are only provided with the side none of these questions will be answered this is the type of fare that appeals to the he woman man hater clubs of america as presented it is the tale of an innocent woman who just happens to be caught up in a romance with a married high-profile attorney is it possible that if she had not been two timing her boy friend and having an affair with a married man the whole nasty murderous sordid incident could have been avoided when you watch this don't worry about going to the fridge you won't miss anything
there is no artistic value in this movie to deserve any award well it does not deserve an audience as well ironically one of the awards is for cinematography but frankly the camera movements are disconcerting to say the least every frame you feel you are getting the full picture its like someone is cropping your view from the edges the story is pathetic well i will be honest i could not bear to watch the entire movie the part that sucked the most was when i saw the soldiers partying in their barracks and one of the soldiers coaxed to drink liquor these and many other similar scenes reminded me so much of steven my advice stay away from this piece of crap
for some reason tv guide gave this two and a half stars plus faye dunaway is in it so it definitely looked like something to see my oh my this may be the worst film i've ever seen ever from its horrid acting time the girl asks the boy wrong with him i shouted to the tv i can't act when she asks what he needs i yell i need acting lessons to the unbelievably bad dialog me back my the brian depalma wannabe ending too it was all just beyond awful i wanted to like it dunaway is one of the best actors ever and the production values were pretty wowzers this had me laughing laughing most of the even bother out of curiosity that was my first mistake staying with it was definitely my second and third and fourth
instead go to the zoo buy some peanuts and feed em to the monkeys monkeys are funny people with amnesia who don't say much just sit there with vacant eyes are not all that comedy there isn't a black person in it and there isn't one funny thing in it buys these things up somehow and puts them on their dollar rack labeled unrated i think they took out the topless scene they may have taken out other stuff too who knows all we know is that whatever they took out isn't there any acting seemed ok to me a lot of unfathomables tho supposed to be a city supposed to be a big lake if so hot in the church people are fanning themselves why are they all wearing coats
i saw this movie a few years back on the bbc i sat thru it how i don't is way up there in the so bad it'good charts kidman pullman must cringe when they see it think woody allen would have worked wonders with the outlandish plot and part could have been played with gusto by leslie was on again tonight i tried to watch it again but too short the few minutes i watched was for the lovely nicole she was so hot around has baldwin ever made a good movie pullman played his stock in trade nice but dim character the f-word coming out of his mouth when the lady from frasier miscast ed as a detective accuses him of murder sounds so wrong stay well away
is nothing else on tv are you really bored well then watch phat beach however don't rent it and definitely do not buy it that would be a big watched this on tv and found myself laughing at certain points i did not laugh long and i did not laugh hard however there were subtle jokes and comments i laughed at if you are looking for an extremely funny hood movie then watch friday if you are looking for a powerful emotional movie that this movie tries of watch something like hoop dreams or lyric if you are lookin for some good black booty go watch a dominique simone porn flick because the nudity in this movie is nearly non-existent however if you have nothing better to do and this is on cable go ahead and watch it you will be slightly out of
this movie is just plain bad weak story weak directing and below average acting the thing that really irritated me was the blatant advertising constantly for a well known internet provider it is obvious some scenes are written to do just that advertising this movie is a slap in the face to anyone who payed money for not watch this it not worth your time
this film was abysmal and not in the good way as some have claimed first off the main character is a very unattractive gingerman second wtf is going on with this van love the plot basically is boy wants sex so buys a van in fairness is quite cool unbelievably given that he looks like a newt he scores with lots of chicks and he fails with some then he scores with a really hot chick and realises he loves this dowdy bird who played hard to get then he drag races with the hot chicks boyfriend and he tips his van at which point danny devito saves the day although he didn't need to because in tipping the van the ginger kid crossed the line first i gave this as i'm willing to assume that some sort of vanning subculture i'm not getting and also because some boobage too
final justice has the great joe don baker running around texas shooting people who shoot people then off to malta where he shoots more people he gets locked up many times for shooting people then he gets into a gunfight with the bad guy who is dressed like a monk there is a boat chase and joe don winds up in jail again finally joe don with the help from elaine from seinfeld kill the bad guy blow up a boat or two and someone gets shot with a flare all this and a catchy theme song just like mitchell
i think that elisabeth rohm though she may try hard is not very good at all i guess it was because of budget that she may have been the only one they could get for that price i mainly watched it for the performance of myron natwick whose work i know very was the most believable and without doubt the most compelling to watch when he wasn't on the screen the thing went dead this was filmed in vancouver he gave me the creeps but be assured that in real life he is a kind funny compassionate man he even said playing that role gave him the watch anything with him in it but elisabeth rohm never again she was as exciting as lint on law and order maybe a very nice person but no actress
this ranks as one of the worst movies i've seen in years besides cuba and angie the acting is actually embarrassing wasn't archer once a decent actress what happened to her the action is decent but completely implausible the make up is so bad worth mentioning i mean who ever even thinks about the makeup in a contemporary feature film someone should tell the make up artist and the dop that you're not supposed to actually see it the ending is a massive disappointment along the lines of and then they realized it was all a waste your time or your money you're better off just staring into space for hours
a dreary and pointless bit of fluff fluff but fluff badly scripted with inane and wooden dialogue you do not care if the characters even if the actors themselves live or die little grace or charm little action little point to the whole thing perhaps some of the set and setting will gaps between the boards of all the buildings may be true to the way life was lived the framework encounter is unnecessary and distracting and the hoppalong cassidy character himself is both boring and inept
you don't need to write a script for this trashed outrage you just sit back and watch a pair of moonshine women and guests duke each other out before a riotous audience exposure at the jerry show violent and obnoxious this cash-in on the real jerry springer program reveals everything that the over-rated hyped talk show doesn't show to you on the air unless you have a collection of uncensored videos made by the producers of cops even the outside world of springerland reveals the most amateurish acting of the decade this goes to show you that the gong show movie had a central character in a motion picture turkey change the channel
having listened to and enjoyed harvey omen ii commentary i was shocked to discover he was also behind this absolute piece of rubbish like a really bad tv movie you might glimpse in the middle of the day when you have the flu and are too ill to reach the remote i think at the bit where michael lerner is confronted by what i can only describe as a high school cast of les miserables my mouth hung open in disbelief and then my mouth was going up and down because i was laughing so much dire i don't know why i have to write a minimum of ten lines i have made my point succinctly nothing clever about all this modern verbiage
with one of my very favorite actors james spader i expected this film to be at least tolerable it wasn't after the first half hour i watched the rest of it with the remote control in my hand so the fast forward was at the ready so trite so standard one knows going to happen in each scene one can even predict the dialogue word for word this is one of those movies that makes one scratch ones head and say how did this movie ever get made in an effort to say something positive i'll add that there are some mildly entertaining special effects but on the whole if you've seen movies or you are over years old do yourself a favor and skip this one
a repressed housewife annoying lisping angie dickinson whose body double us with an extreme closeup of her delicates is sexually bored by her husband and decides to branch-out this directly results in a string of murders that soon involve a high-class prostitute allen clearly i am in the wrong business if she can bring home a night and her psychologist caine if you are going to watch de palma rip off me pay homage to hitchcock watch sisters instead of this dressed to kill while loaded with style and technical skill is one of the tackiest thrillers i have had the displeasure of sitting through the plot is absurd and tired it does feature some surprisingly effective jump scares and nasty graphic murder sequences that should please any horror fan as long as they can get past the silly story line that must have been dated even in
oh god what a horrible horrible film meant to be a comment on the state of society just a reflection of the worst of the worst in reality tv interstitials hosted by jason jones and don mckellar are the most obnoxious part written in a tone that is perhaps meant to be reflexive and insightful rather these moments are mind numbing as they speak to the camera with dialogue written by someone with a love for insulting condescending speech that shoves the meaning of the film down the a point to would-be filmmakers long takes and quiet scenes do not equal art neither do extreme angles or logic stretched to the point of anyone out there is interested in watching this film please don't seriously please you have better things to do
horrible film with bits of the ramones strewn about your worse than average comedy format of the cool kids taking over the school with some whimsical plan this movie is terrible the plot consists of a girl who enjoys the ramones and a school bent on fighting against their oppressive administration forget this movie and watch something like wild zero starring guitar wolf if you want an entertaining b movie terrible acting terrible writing terrible plot with the stamp of approval of the ramones who probably needed some money quick so they said yes to this movie that is the only logical thing i can think of because this movie blows
what a film seemed to be trying to copy cutting edge comedy but the direction and the script was sloppy sickly and sentimental in the worst film tradition jack was self-indulgent and self-regarding and the other characters were equally unmasking and uninteresting the soundtrack was tedious we are were fans of black but none of us did more than mange a forced titter for the duration why did he feel he needed to make this will not watch another of his films without reading reviews more carefully he drunk when he read the script before signing up for this drivel
the box for to die for suckered me in a shirtless hunky guy and the promise of some laughs and sex there was plenty of thomas arklie easy on the eyes but no laughs and little couple mark and simon have allegedly been together several years but neither character is interesting enough to care about so hard to imagine that they care about each other the fault seems to lie in the script not the performances both actors do the best they can with what they're given ending is sappy and unaffecting not totally unaffecting i felt relief that it was over you're looking for a movie about gay relationships and aids funny parting glances is far better
from the start you know how this movie will end so full of clich√©s your typical nra member will not even like this movie i give it out of only because of the acting of william benton i can't believe people voted for this movie so biased towards a certain point of view a thief people aren't born bad neither are they born good they are born with a clean slate society parents and education what makes them who they are and if they take the wrong turn somewhere down the line it certainly isn't going to be the american penal system that gets them back on track anyway avoid this movie like the plague i bet you have better things to do with your time than waste it on this piece of
reviews for this film were lukewarm at best while expectations were sky high a big budget tons of popular faces a rather funny idea and a main actress everyone loves the end result is a disaster alice supposedly humorous journey in fantasy world fails in every way to entertain audience didn't hear a single laugh throughout the entire presentation going through page-thin story line and one-dimensional characters without a single spark not a sign of the magic it wished it had the minutes of film here are sterile with clumsy direction and some good actors doing their best to come of as professionals in a feature that certainly couldn't seem that great an idea on the set let alone on paper l'odyss√©e d'alice tremblay is a collage of comic sketches linked together with a thin layer of good ideas avoid or boredom will haunt you
i caught sorrows lost at the new york film and video festival and i guess i had some high hopes for this film sadly this is just another visual fx calling card the story is pretty lame the bad lighting and camera work along with the less than great editing and music all make the film seem low it really too much to ask that fx shorts have better stories and have the rest of the technical production be on par with the fx you can't just get away with cool fx in shorts anymore been years since made a big splash at least that short quick cool and was even a little funny none of that can be said about sorrows lost
last week i took a look at the weekly nielsen ratings and there was veronica mars supposedly the best show you're not they're right that you're not watching it it aired twice and was ranked and out of this is the lowest-rated show on any nationally broadcast network and deservedly so i tried to watch it a couple of times because of all the press coverage hyping it as a great show a realistic look at life and all such nonsense the reality was otherwise veronica mars is a bore as unrealistic as it gets and it richly deserves to be only mystery is why cw felt compelled to put on its inaugural schedule the lowest-rated show in memory after two years of continued commercial and artistic failure
if you want to watch a good film about how women can fight back against sexual assault then this film is not the film that you want to watch it was a social commentary about a woman who was victimized and fights back spoiler rosario dawson turns the tables on her assailant instead of using the criminal justice system the victim resorts to using vigilantism she in essence nullifies the judicial system the film the accused was a much better film because the victim uses the judicial system and wins what the descent does is telling victims of assault that they should resort to violence is victim any better that the accuser no
after an initial release of very good eurotrash titles redemption has managed to scrape the bottom of the barrel with the bloodsucker leads the dance i found no bloodsuckers anywhere in this story is simple a mysterious count invites several actresses to his castle for a little vacation after some sofcore sexual shenanigans the girls get decapitated one by one who is the killer who knows there are more red herrings in this one than at the local fish market on pace is excruciating the story is silly and the skin scenes aren't all that terrific this one a miss
how is it possible that a movie this bad can be made bad acting bad script just an embarrassment all around this is just one bad clich√© after movie actually has some big name stars in it unfortunately they're singers and not movie made hardly any money for a good reason the appeal of black cowboy movies just isn't there a shame they didn't have a good story to tell movie actually has some big name stars in it unfortunately they're singers and not movie made hardly any money for a good reason the appeal of black cowboy movies just isn't there a shame they didn't have a good story to tell
the first half of the film is ok the second half one of the most tedious experiences imaginable quite possibly the most overrated movie of all time pulp fiction was robbed for best picture this is one of those films that people feel required to love because the main character is slow
quirky independent theatrical christian are all teasers that made me look forward to spending an hour or so discovering a jewel of a film boy was i disappointed julian po never gets over itself the film is relentlessly self-conscious i found myself unable to suspend disbelief for even a moment the overdone obviously theatrical sets the overdone obviously theatrical acting the overdone obviously theatrical directing well you get the idea do not need to be delivered sledge hammer style and hard to feel much of anything for julian po because we never know much about him the ridiculous girlfriend the annoying townsfolk the idiotic clergyman the bratty kids why would anyone particularly anyone with a life long ambition to get to the seaside character decide to stay in such a dismal place
hopalong cassidy with a horse who is not white not named topper go travesty does a gross injustice to the greatest of all cowboy heroes hopalong cassidy the actor who plays him is young versus old blond haired versus white haired and kills people versus shooting the gun out of their hands will the real hopalong please stand of the worst movies ever made it or not by the person who brought us the grandfather saga
i have no idea as to which audience director george schlatter hoped to sell this comedy-of-ills with redd foxx in the central role and enough pimpy outfits and polyester to carpet the entire norman plays like a blaxploitation picture combined with any number of silly sitcom episodes involving comic misunderstandings not to mention an elongated cameo by waylon flowers based on a play by sam bobrick and ron clark this tale of an estranged married couple and pearl bailey learning the hard way that their son is secretly living with a mincing prancing white enough limp-wristed jokes to shame any early episode of company bailey keeps her dignity and sheer confusion is good for a couple of chuckles but the rest of the performers are humiliated from
corky romano has to be one of the most jaw dropping and horrific ever the sometimes amusing chris kattan who pulled off a very funny performance in the hilarious undercover brother his character in corky is so stupid and so unfunny-which is a shame since the premise is a wonderful idea to bad they ran out of them when they got to page on the script
nacho vigalondo is very famous in spain he is a kind of bad showman who can make you feel sick very embarrassing nacho had made some commercials in tv i remember one in which nacho was looking for paul mc carney around madrid commercial was about a mc carney cd collection little movie is like a commercial bad storyline bad directing and awful performances i can't believe that a disgusting movie like this was in the kodak theater poor could made this movie because of his wife the producer of this a woman very well connected with spanish tv business men
the western society has been fed ideas about india being a poor country movies like these only make those beliefs stronger such illustrations make it all the more difficult for indians to be accepted abroad agreed there are poor and homeless in india but why is there no representation of educated people if not the successful totally hated the idea of the movie portraying patrick swayze as another mother teressa in my opinion this movie has shown india in a very bad light giving wrong notions it is unjust to discuss only one aspect of the society exactly the reason why people ask me when we go to india can we hire an elephant right outside the airport so we do not have to walk on the roads so full of filth and who want a second opinion on contemporary indian society should watch monsoon wedding
alright if you want to go see this movie just give me our money you were it counts and you'll have the same amount of fun guarantee more fun this movie once again shows what happens can't get any one else to hire your family and your forced to own movies same i'm going through puberty humor jokes and grosser this movie is really a disgrace to movie goers to shock you into laughing because you can't believe the levels to stoop to make you laugh so my offer above stands as
i looked over the other comments and was thoroughly amused to find that clearly only people who actually worked on the movie had commented i mean i hate to say bad things about an amateur production but if you make a bad movie and want to comment on it tone it down a little groundbreaking is a little over the top this is a boston based college production that doesn't even achieve the level of most amateur college film what you would expect a bunch of kids to do a silly action film without much creativity pretty funny if you're willing to poke fun at it not something you will ever see unless you are a student at emerson college
for a film with so much promise it was disappointing thinly plotted and the acting ranging between horrendous and plot had more holes in it than swiss cheese and the worst clich√©d ending i've seen in a movie for some time the final scene would have ripped my heart out if the entire movie hadn't been so painful to begin with i was numb from the very first scene one was left wondering if the sister was trying to reach out to her twin for help or simply scare her to death which would have been better for the audience and saved us from two hours of the worst acting i've seen to date it was a horror in the true sense of the word
i only lasted before self preservation jerked me out of the empty eyed drooling stupor that this film effortlessly induced and propelled me screaming back to the video shop armed for say the film was bad would be a missed opportunity to use words interspersed with characters from the top keys on my keyboard to keep these comments to be
my wife and i started to watch this movie with anticipation it looked warm and touching it started out well but soon became boring and frankly idiotic after a while it got so bad that we turned it off the movie was poorly acted and honesty we couldn't really understand or wanted to understand what exactly why or how the hell they could put up with this woman you lost sympathy for her after she was rude and acting wackos singing and cleaning i would have had her committed and of course like most movies and series made in hollywood we have to throw it a token gay character this movie was boring i was expecting more from diane keaton
i thought maybe a film which boasted a cast including peter o'toole susannah york michael craig harry andrews might be worth watching alas i was wrong utter pretentious nonsense from beginning to end with both o'toole and york overacting wildly i watched it twice and still have no idea what is was about i've a feeling o'toole plays the laird of a scottish castle who has a drink problem and likes reliving childhood games with his sister he is also barking mad but apart from that your guess is as good as film has no redeeming feature whatsoever i can only assume the cast and director were blackmailed into making this dreary unimaginative stagy piffle clearly a waste of the time of a talented cast and director risible
if an auteur gives himself credits before the main title and about more credits before the movie starts and the first shot shows the auteur rolling around on a bed in lycra bike shorts it won't be a surprise to observe that said auteur has the kind of body that should never be seen in spandex the kind of look that might be useful to a homosexual aversion have given this thing the dishing it deserves for me the most pitiable moment came when the trip from la was signified by a plane landing at what appeared to be lax and the return was signified by a shot of a fedex cargo plane
there just isn't enough here there a few funny spots but not really enough i was very disappointed because i love stupid movies i was expecting this to be a hidden gem it was not it was a hidden whole time i was watching it i was thinking geez i could do better than that and i'm a moron don't believe the few good reviews i was suckered in by them at no point did i laugh at loud maybe this was funny or cutting edge in but man it fell flat today this movie had promise it just didn't deliver on it maybe if they rewrote it a few more times i cant fault the actors they weren't the best but they just didn't have much with which to work this movie failed because of threadbare writing sorely disappointed
i can say nothing more about this movie than man this sucks if you really hate yourself and want to do some severe damage to your brain watch this movie the best cure in the world for taking away happiness when i started watching this film i was completely happy afterwords i could feel my brain melting like it was struck by molten lava god i hate that stupid dinosaur so if you want severe brain damage watch this movie it will do the trick
this is only related to the first movie by the name the plot has nothing to do with the first and the whole movie stinks i have no idea what they were thinking but this movie is so bad avoid this at all costs the first movie in the series is acceptable as a slasher flick and so is the fourth but this one and the are rubbish
this was the only time i ever walked out on a movie years later i saw it in the cable listings and thought maybe i should give it another try suffice to say that i was right the first time this ranks second only to godzilla as the worst movie i've ever seen
this film limps from self indulgent moment to self indulgent moment promising to develop into something worth hanging on for but it doesn't flat self conscious unimaginative and series of set images and backdrops don't make a film they make a calendar this kind of pitiful socialist pseudo drama documentary true it really happened not only fails to entertain it fails to convince so it doesn't even function as social history clich√©s co-mingled with bad acting make this a film very difficult to finish the amusement factor wearing off fairly quickly the characters are one dimensional never developing to the extent that one feels for them the ego is the largest character in this film
the turgid pace of this movie numbs us to any shocks that it might provide there was no real suspense most of the characters were insipid the chesty irish priest was as lame as the love interest interest is misleading the girl that they chose to provide the sensuality might be better the central conflict of the main character was uninvolving this film is entirely devoid of positives it is like a tedious exercise by someone who didn't want to go to the gym that day but did anyway
avoid this one unless you want to watch an expensive but badly made movie example the sound is good but the dialogue is not clear a cardinal sin in a french film attempts to combine western drug intrigue and ancien regime costume epic what well consider this the cowboy music is hilarious during sword fights or how about the woman in her underwear holding a knife and jumping up and down on the should do a up tiger lily on this bomb rewrite the script and then either dub or subtitle it heck almost that now gerard depardieu and carole bouquet both known to american audiences have roles
this is simply put the worst movie i have ever seen it ranges from like hours and the box art was totally misleading my friends and i rented it because we thought it would be a poor you know to laugh at and make fun of no there is nothing funny about this movie only pain then the movie starts up and they are speaking some sort of different language we think oh its just the beginning but no from there the movie plummets and becomes more of like a super boring book you had to read in grade school where nothing literally happens for hours and the battle scenes rival those of kids fighting on a playground omit cinematography and this movie belongs in trash compactor movies like this will lead to the world we see in wall-e which by the way was a good movie
rex reed once said of a movie and julia to be specific that it looked like it was shot through pomegranate juice i was reminded of that as i snored through purple butterfly this one appeared to be shot through story was boring and it was not helped that for large portions of scenes actors faces were literally out of focus or would only come into focus after extended periods of time everyone looked the same so it was hard to distinguish among the characters i call this the dead poets society was nobody to care about nobody to become interested in dramatically and the movie shed no historical light on a very interesting period of time and set of total disappointment
this was the most pointless film i have ever seen as there was no plot and the actors did not seem to care of the film had absolutely no plot whatsoever i laughed so much my ribs began to ache the bit where the old men when to capture robert duvall was ludicrous on a directorial level making a noir film does not involve lots of raining sequences and pointless closeups on the main character this is a failed attempt to create a noir thriller and instead alienates the viewer with incoherent scenes seeing as this was based on a manuscript by john grisham i do not count this as one of his book to film adaptations as it displays none of the suspense and engaging storyline as films such as the firm or the rainmaker
i am dumbfounded that i actually sat and watched this i love independent films horror films and the whole zombie thing in general but when you add you've crossed a line that should never be crossed i hope the people in this movie had a great time making it then at least it wasn't a total waste you'd never know by watching it though script are you kidding acting i think even the trees were faking cinematography well there must've been a camera there period i don't think there was any actual planning involved in the making of this movie such a total waste of time that i won't prolong it by commenting further
warning spoiler i have to agree with you it was almost there this was such a bad movie about such and interesting true story it had such promise but the acting was ridiculous at best some sets were beautiful and realistic others are something out of a theme park i found myself laughing as i watched what was suppose to be serious scenes i really wanted to like this movie but i couldn't the best part was the fight between friends that ended with the king dying i liked the queens punishment and the final shot made a beautiful picture though there are so many better movies to watch i don't recommend this
there are no spoilers in this review nothing to plot nothing most clip shows at least try to tie the clips into the plot by some tenuous stretch but this didn't even do that clips three lines to lead into the next interminable sequence of dull clips ok so perhaps they were short on production time but they'd have been better off skipping this episode entirely what a waste of not sure how this got made in fact scrubs is usually much better at subverting tropes but somehow this got heavens they were back on form by the next episode
i concur with everyone above who said anything that will convince you to not waste even a briefest of moments watching this amazingly amateurish movie very poor acting offhand production values utterly pedestrian direction and a script so inept and inane it should never have been written let alone produced even hollywood professionals apparently go to work just for a paycheck although no one should have been paid for this bad work careers should instead have ended over this inconsequential there is something fascinating about watching something so jaw-droppingly bad and chad lowe is terrifically and consistently bad
revenge on us the viewing public perhaps i sat through this hour movie and i was waiting for the second act to kick in so that the movie lived up to its title but costner never avenges his lovers fate she dies and the movie ends i was left wondering where the rest of the movie was if a movie is called revenge then the hero better get some by the end of the film i had a choice of seeing this or black rain at the cinema thankfully i saw the other brothers movie at the cinema caught up with this turkey on video there was one good thing about the film and was its beautiful theme tune listen to the watch this its awful out of
i saw this film at the ny gay lesbian film festival and thought it was pretty bad first and most distracting was the way much of it was shot that is a lot of slow motion and overly arty close-ups that seemed to have no wise or than to show the skills of the cinematographer i believe was also the director this film seemed what a pretentious film student would come up with the lead actor levine was certainly very cute but was a mediocre actor at best and the rest of the cast ranged from so-so to bad the story itself was mostly annoyingly predictable i do have to concede that most of the audience seemed to enjoy the film laughing and sighing constantly but i disliked it a great deal
very sad that lucian pintilie does not stop making movies they get worse every time niki and flo is a depressing stab at the camera unfortunate that from the many movies that are made yearly in romania the worst of them get to be sent abroad chicago international film festival this movie without a plot acting or script is a waste of time and money score out of
i'm just quite disappointed with soul survivors it doesn't worth even a comment in this forum the script is very poor as well as all the acting and for our entertainment it features a pointless do yourselves a favor be a real waste your time in this piece of crap someday you'll thank me
this movie is awful i haven't laughed so hard at a movie that was unintentionally funny in a long time leno should've stuck to stand up and late night tv the cars in the movie were cool but the movie by itself is the dumbest movie i've ever seen pathetic the acting is horrible and the plot could've been written by a year old don't get me wrong jay leno is hilarious but not in this movie
seems everyone in this film is channeling woody allen they stammer and pause and stammer some more only for really die-hard denero fans it tries to appear as edgy and artistic but it comes off as looking like a very very low budget film made by college students the most often used word in the whole film is hum the film does peg the atmosphere of the late seventies though if you like films where people are constantly talking over each other horrible lighting if it is for sake and makes you feel like you are sitting in on a lame political meeting then you might like this but you need to be really bored i found this cd in the dollar bin and now i know why
a terrible amateur movie director not todd sheets his new friend and sister explore a cave the friend and sister fall in and get rescued meanwhile a gang of horribly acted girls are defending their turf whatever the heck that means this film and i use the term very loosely is so bad that well bad the humor is painfully unfunny the action merely sad now i've seen some atrociously awful horror films in my time failed to grow jaded in my approach to watching low-budget films yet i still weep openly for anyone who choose to sit through this only for the most hardened maschocists amongst you but the rest run away grade f
this really was a waste of movie has a weak plot the story is fragmented and ends very abruptly with many the animation is top notch the movie started i tried to give it the benefit of the doubt by telling myself that it might get interesting in the later stage but it was never unique this same plot has been played over and over again but what made it worse was that the major plot hole was the whole story on how to kill the writer could have done so much more with the entire concept but seemed that he or she did not have their heart in it and wanted to close the movie as soon as it too much hype but not able to deliver
this is quite possibly the worst christmas film ever the plot is virtually non-existent the acting in particular is poor at best ben affleck fans will probably defend this film but deep down they must agree as far as i could gather the plot consisted of ben affleck a millionaire salesman is told by a shrink to go to a place that reminds him of his childhood and burn a list of things he wanted to forget from his childhood on doing this he ends up paying the family currently living in the house to be his family for christmas and that is it the film goes on and eventually he gets together with the daughter of the family blah blah blah
the director sidney j furie has created in hollow point a post-modern absurdist masterpiece that challenges and constantly surprises the audience j furie dares to ask the question of what happens to the tired conventional traditionalist paradigms of plot and characterisation when you remove the crutches of motivation and reason result leads me to say that my opinion of him could not possibly get any and a half nothing in this movie makes any sense the law enforcement agents are flat out unlikeable and the organised criminals are full on insane
avoid the usa version it is with added us footage and the worst dubbing you've ever heard probably done by new york amateurs the dubbing is so bad that it sounds like mystery science theater i think a black guy from the bronx does voice i couldn't watch the entire film it was that bad instead of this americanized version watch other greats like the streetfighter or karate warriors
i've tried to watch this show several times but for a show called that show i don't find much apart from a few haircuts and the occasional reference to disco that actually evokes the the decade in which i grew up of the episodes i have seen most of the plots and jokes could be set in any time period take away the novelty of being set in the and the show is neither interesting nor you're looking for a show that more successfully represents the experience of youth in america in the in my humble opinion you can do no better than the wonder years
i don't know why but when i am asked about bad movies i have seen i often think of the air up there i know that technically lots of movies are horrible compared to it and i have seen worse acting just that so bland so predictable in a word mediocre
the only good thing about this unfunny dreck is that i didn't have to pay for it i saw it for free at college and if a college student can't find humor in something that was free acting and poor jokes cannot be masked by an excellent yet bewildering set design goes out of its way to market volkswagon beetles i don't know what michaels myers was doing in this movie but i have never seen anything more depressing this was nothing more than a blatant effort to capitalize on the previous success of the grinch has its opponents but i enjoyed it very much difficult not to sit through this failure and wonder what better projects were passed over to fund want a funny seuss adaptation go with the grinch
i have watched episodes of caveman and i have no idea why i continue except maybe waiting for it to get better me this show is just pumping itself off the commercials with no real humor as we sat around watching these shows we all speculated on what was going to episode of the woman cave-woman with a attitude was actually a big yea right for us crude in a theater and acts tough to strangers and truth be told she needed a consider myself a pretty good reviewer taking in everything but i must say cavemen is comparable to the old show my mother the car i give it a only because they deserve better than a because they actually spent money on it
watching this stinker constitutes cruel and unusal punishment at the hands of sandler truly a slow and painful the dvd in the bin at wal mart but the thought that keeps echoing in my head is how can i get my money most unforgivable thing about the movie is that the boat just does not constructive suggestion mystery comedy theatre you know that show on the scifi channel in which some guy and his muppet-machines spoof the most unwatchable horror flicks science theatre immediately spin off a comedy program and feature this flick without a good humorous spoof of this train wreck i fear that viewers may actually begin following sandler with ice picks and
if my grandma did films they would probably do much better figure than this one incredible bad the main characters mom the dad and son are ok specially the mother a nice actress and the kid also proves to be a nice one specially on the scenes where he is supposed to be scary but does the the director know the meaning of the words plot point triller and good script the script hasn't any evolving atmosphere to become a suspense thing if you like being chased by trees you can probably enjoy it otherwise just stay at home and sleep oh actually there was something funny the from but we couldn't realize it since the image is so bad on mini-dv and the cars are so old and
this movie was a stupid piece of crap bad everything why is it that we who love western movies get jilted nine out of ten times when renting westerns it seems that if you don't see names like robert duval kevin kostner or tom selleck attached to the cover it isn't worth messing with for the most part the main action of shiloh falls was taking place in yet the revolvers used were models even the shooting was bad in one scene the marshal fanned his six-shooter about nine times and couldn't hit any of three large men who were only about twenty feet away i had to turn it off after about minutes of this inanity perhaps those who participated in this movie could have taken some lessons at the sunset carson school of acting
this show was absolutely terrible for one george isn't funny and his kids are snobby little brats he also treats his mother with no respect as a hispanic i am highly offended by this show and the way the characters are the dysfunctional family been done to death for once i want to see something original what makes this show funny when other shows have done it millions of times i thought abc would come to its senses and pull this piece of garbage off the air but sadly we're going to have to stomach this until they jump the my opinion they already did
geez this is one of those movies that you think you previously reviewed but you didn't i mean you didn't give a crap about it but somehow it came to your be honest and brief this is one of the worst boring and stupid slashers ever made i can't say anything good about this piece of crap because there are barely decent sequences that could tell made by professional film death scenes are horrible bloodless stupid the plot is somehow good taking in account that it copied popcorn from make things even worse this isn't a movie so bad that good just plain ringwald tried to do her best but it wasn't enough
julia roberts obviously makes a concerted effort to shake off her cotton wool pretty woman persona with this spurious spousal abuse thriller but hard to imagine she'd end up putting in a performance as powerful and convincing oscar winning as she did in erin brokovich based on the back of this rubbish and make no bones about it nothing more than a julia roberts vehicle but unfortunately her performance is not the most lacklustre thing about plot has all the markings of a late night made-for-cable and don't be under the impression that it will offer any insight into the dark world of domestic abuse because non of the characters are sketched out enough for you to really care disappointing and unsatisfying without roberts name above the title i'm sure it would have totally flopped deservedly
i can't believe how anyone can make a comedy about an issue such as homelessness of course brooks has not made a comedy about homeless people no mention of drugs prostitution or violence on these streets the people we meet in this movie are homeless in fantasy land so the only difference between them and us is that they don't eat quite as often brooks movies have become worse and worse over the years this is just another nail in the coffin
this movie has some fatal flaws in it how someone could walk through an open back door of a highly secure medical facility is unbelievable then this same person just walks around the facility and enters the office is just bad writing or bad editing very very predictable movie am not sure how this film got made except it is was filmed in canada and probably received a government grant must say the person playing aaron cory monteith did a good you are really bored and there is nothing else to watch on television then i would say it will kill some time but otherwise it is a movie no actor would want on their resume
protocol is an implausible movie whose only saving grace is that it stars goldie hawn along with a good cast of supporting actors the story revolves around a ditzy cocktail waitress who becomes famous after inadvertently saving the life of an arab dignitary the story goes downhill halfway through the movie and charm just doesn't save this movie unless you are a goldie hawn fan don't go out of your way to see this film
i really do not have any clue as to why some people find the power rangers television show even remotely interesting at all the costumes are completely ridiculous and the people playing in them also look completely foolish at the same time there is absolutely anything remotely interesting about the power rangers this is just a higher priced television commercial designed to sell extremely cheesy plastic garbage to the unsuspecting children around the world from the notes i can see that been banned in the country of new zealand and from what i have seen i can agree with their decision avoid this show at all costs terrible and ridiculous
jane russell proved to be a delightful musical-comedy performer in the similarly titled gentlemen prefer blondes but sadly this film squanders those skills there is a budget and nice paris photography but the film just doesn't work ms russell seems to be playing marilyn monroe that leaves nobody to adequately play jane russell some of the other players are way out of their are several embarrassing scenes most of all be warned there is a musical number where boneheaded african cannibals cook the brunettes in a pot after alan young sings in a gorilla is an interesting at times embarrassing waste of resources gentlemen marry brunettes richard sale jane russell jeanne crain alan young scott brady
i gave it a instead of a because i think the wild women of wongo is worse this is an exercise in patience like having your teeth cleaned by a bad dental hygienist no plot no logic there is certainly no acting the shark has some quality dialogue we don't wonder about anything we don't know how people got where they got always amazing to me how things like this even get released i agree with the previous writer that it isn't even funny bad i know about minutes long and that will fill up about that much space on a dvd collection like a paperweight or a bad painting you bought at a starving artists sale it covers the crack in the wall
bela lugosi as creepy insane scientist who uses orchids to woo brides in order to steal life essence for aged wife the midget in this film is hilarious a lot of freaks plus a lot of padding and no plot makes watching this film a nightmare i loved how all the pieces fell together in the end in typical hollywood fashion the story never gets interesting and you feel helpless as you i'd score bore flicks like this one low but the midget added just enough creepiness and entertainent to gain a couple more points
hi may be because i am not a theater major or a sophisticated movie watcher i think this movie is boring and rented this movie because of charles bronson and title but boy what a waste of time just watching guys sitting in a vault and talking movie on this dvd was so dark i had hard time watching the darn movie i realize it is a movie but they are putting it on a dvd then they should do some digital i was totally surprised to see these high marks on imdb for this movie like i said before i am not as sophisticated as the other folks who commented on this movie earlier
where to yea message to the bad guys when you first find the person you have been tracking order to kill that witnessed a crime you committed don't spend time talking to her so that she has yet another opportunity to get away message to the victim when the thugs are talking amongst themselves and arguing take that opportunity to run away don't sit there and watch them until you make a noise they hear message to the director if someone has a or minute head start in a vehicle or on foot you can't have the bad guys on their heels or bumper right away time and motion doesn't work that way it would also be nice to think that a woman doesn't have to brutally men in order to empower herself to leave an abusive relationship at home
where to begin the special effects should be named special defects when the director shouted action i guess he also indicated to the actors to carry out the worst performance they could think of maybe he was annoyed with the producers and wanted to make sure that they would not recover a single cent out of their investment and that the work would be a case study of how not to make movie or maybe he hated art school and wanted to be an accountant but his family did not let only thing that is sure that whoever employs him in the future is because its in love with him its objectivity jumped through the window or because he changed its name and deleted all past previous references
the first movie is pretty good this one is pretty a lot of footage the opening credits and end title from criminally insane the new footage shot on video really sticks out as poorly done scenes lack proper lighting the sound is sometimes nearly inaudible even video glitches like the picture rolling and so all bad sequels it basically just repeats the story of the first one ethel kills everybody who shares her living space often for reasons having to do with them getting in the way of food she least it is only an extra on the dvd for the first one which also includes the same film black wedding too bad it doesn't include the death nurse movies though
in a horror movie that is alright first off lets start with kate her main goals include getting laid by george clooney looking good and last but not least screwing everyone over gotta love her she had about amazingly good chances to finish off this sicko but instead she ran i mean she didn't wanna bring guy out for minutes and when she did it was too late i mean the guy tried to rape her i cant get into these movies where the main character is a sad idiot i mean who honestly would have any sympathy for a guy who finishes off everyone she has meet in a night the movie kept going on and as a result lost all its credibility
after reading several good reviews as well as hearing nice things about it by word of mouth i decided to rent come undone i must say i was rather disappointed the story was hard to follow because the film is set as a series of flashbacks between the present and recent past that are very poorly executed the characters despite the actors best efforts are flat and uninteresting the sex is and nudity are more explicit than they need to be i've never seen a film where they seemed so unnecessary to the plot the ending is very anti-climatic and leaves many unanswered questions to a story line that wasn't explained well to begin with in my opinion a waste of time
is rich ailing elizabeth taylor courting the angel of death on her island fortress in the mediterranean or is she just more precisely usual actually both are applicable in director joseph wandering meandering mess called boom appropriately titled since tempers in the lush luxurious setting are nearly ready to explode richard burton climbs mountain uninvited she dresses him in a robe complete with saber though great-looking in widescreen the picture is otherwise quite deadly a failure even liz n dick-philes should shun stars collective what the hell attitude to their film careers reached an ego-mad nadir here pointless confused and maddening boom is a screenwriter tennessee williams who adapted his own unsuccessful play the milk train doesn't stop here anymore was said to be quite fond of it from
this was a silly movie with a predictable storyline and dreadful acting willy nelson was as stiff as his braids the movie just seemed like a very long advert for the bright red lipstick that jessica simpson wore especially as there were so many close-ups on her face the premise was not amusing and as i said soooooooo predictable whatever money was spent on making this movie was a shameful waste any allusions to other old marilyn monroe movies did not enhance the viewing of blonde ambition at all it was also so unbelievable jessica simpson being able to step into an executive secretary position at the drop of a hat that was laughable
oh my god this movie insults the intelligence of everybody i mean really who thinks three kids can fight to ninjas and win not to mention the brainless humor thrown in this film is baaaaaaaaaaaaaad the movie is an omen the only thing good for is a time killer or unintentional laughs
this is an incomprehensible horribly low budget piece of don't even have the vocabulary to say how dire turgid boring confusing and just plain strange this effort is what d'ya know i do set in a post-apocalyptic america some guys meet on a beach and slaughter and chaos ensue it was all so incomprehensible i couldn't make head or tail of any of how this got picked up by national lampoon totally defeats me it really is not in a its so bad good cult is just awful awful awful if you still don't believe me then watch it with every intention of loving it then come back here and tell me what you think even gerbils on acid couldn't hope to understand or even better destroy
it seems evident from this adaptation that he did not not only did he leave the plot behind he made up his own the things that he chose to leave in were so ridiculously unbelievable that i was happy he chose to leave out some of the most important parts of the novel the plot was hazy inconsistent and choppy to say the least i don't want to say anything mean-spirited about the actors but they can't act dickens is difficult of course but this is pathetic micawber was nothing more than a mid-nineteenth century kramer and the less said about betsy trotwood the better if you want to see the real copperfield watch the wonderful bbc adaptation as for the screenplay think he read the notes
where is it written that sequels must suck scream didn't others didn't but this one sure did problems include horrible actors christopher walken could act in the entire film bad writing will never understand going on and i even have done research on the idea of nephilim before and just horrible choices for casting eric roberts makes the stupidest archangel michael that i have ever seen in my it like the plague unless you are desperate to see christopher walken in that case just fast-forward to the parts where he is in the film and avoid the
maaan where do i start with this god awful movie bad bad bad story telling i do not know what the director was thinking when he made this movie namaste london was quite an enjoyable movie to be the soundtrack was good but in this my a movie which is supposed to be a musical songs are soooo bad ar rahman should have been the music director two great actors a much better job should have been done by the director even though the first half sucks the last mins of the movie are ok performances from salman and ajay save the movie from being a total it if you have nothing better to do the last good movie from bollywood i watched and i do watch a load of them is dev d and wake up sid
hey if you have a little over an hour to kill and find paint to be too exciting i'd suggest it if thou you happen to like cheap b-movies like me good for a giggle other than that i wouldn't suggest that you rent it i'd wait till it comes on the tube say round am on the free access channel of your supplier the band that did this sound track by the way was on the road after for about two years after this flick and no they sounded just as bad live according to the two small town reviews i could find on them so once again good if you find grass growing to much fun but good to watch if you like to see how not to shoot a low budget movie
this film although not totally bad should have been filmed where the actual events took place grand island nebraska was devastated by no less than seven tornados on the night of june grand island is situated in the nearly treeless flat platte river valley in hall county the makers of this movie filmed in the tree covered hills of ontario and moved the whole event to a non-existant town called blainsworth the people of grand island bravely survived this awful night only to be forgotten because of a poorly made movie
i've seen a movie thats sort of like this were a transsexual drugs woman and he then picks there nose with a knife and rips there nose to peaces he then slices there tongue and eats most gruesome part of the movie is were he cuts there left eye out and starts dancing with it he then starts to eat the woman not sure what the movies called but i know a cult movie and that it was made in the nose picker is fairly a crap movie and the picture and volume quality is very don't waste you're time buying and watching this movie its totally prefer day of the woman also known as i spit on your grave one of the best cult movies ever check out this link
first of all when i saw the teaser trailer for wendy wu i was definitely excited brenda song one of the hottest girls on disney channel would be doing martial arts and i was fine with that until i saw the movie the action was poorly constructed the movie couldn't have realated to anyone the fighting was unrealistic and it sucked along with the plot if you really think about a wannabe buffy the vampire slayer a girl who is the descendant of other warriors who were women a girl wants to ignore her calling and wants to become homecoming queen the watcher who her to prepare for a big fight against some ancient evil the idea just wasn't all that original the movie is waste of time
i went to see the omega code with a group of other christians totaling about people we all expected a good piece of christian film-making what we got was an excruciatingly painful drawn-out and pretty boring attempt at a film it has good looking production values but also has poor acting a weak script with lousy dialogue and no real sense of direction from the first minutes we all knew it would be a long night we all hated it and some people in our group placed this movie as reeking of more cheese than anaconda none of us could believe that the movie lasted less than hours flashy effects and crisp looking cinematography can't save this bad bad movie i'd give it a out of and the rating is only that high because i rented the abominable movie werewolf the night before i saw this movie
i'm all for a bad horror movie but this was just a pile of dog how anyone can call this movie cool or decent is beyond me if you like rushed editing to cover the special effects bad acting and a bad script then go for it there was no suspense whatsoever and the gore factor was laughable because it was so fake i'll take hostel or wolf creek over this pile any day my partner gave up after about minutes she knows a stinker when she sees one i on the other hand stupidly sat through the whole movie just to wait and see if it got any better no such luck i haven't sen his other movie torched and i doubt if i'll bother now
this really is the most dreadful film i have ever seen i simply have no idea how anyone has the audacity to put this on production standards are atrocious there is no pretence here at cinematography the camera work scripting acting and sound are unbelievably crass i think there is a plot but it could have been done in minutes sparing us the time to watch it the hysterical neurotic girls at the centre of this piece have no credibility would urge anyone to avoid spending any time or money on this title it is truly december
this wretched movie shows that not even some of best can salvage a true landfill could spend much time describing everything that was bad about this effort but that would require more time and i've already wasted minutes at it now after death shows how tragic the life of one of our greatest actors had sutherland why have to fill more lines to get this accepted i have to fill more lines to get this accepted i have to fill more lines to get this waste your time with this movie i'm overdue to do something interesting bye
this movie was different in that it didn't show the typical gay stereotypes that i'm used to seeing but that doesn't change the fact that it totally lacks a storyline i'm sure that there are many gay men who are just happy to see themselves depicted on screen since black gay characters are seldom seen and when they are the characters are usually not fully developed but how hard would it have been for the writer to actually script a story with a beginning middle and end or how about a story that was focused there really doesn't seem to be a point to this film and even though it is a low budget film that is still no excuse for the lack of story or plot
leave it to us finns to take a stupid idea blow it out of proportion and try to market it as cool lordi is a mediocre band at best and a single gimmick will get you only so all you marketing idiots out there this is the reason for the inherent minority complex that is often encountered when finland tries to export isn't scary lordi is lame lordi is want to apologize to the rest of the world for this plastic-faced idiocy sure they won the wait they won the eurovision it i rest my case
i thought i was going to watch a scary movie and ended up laughing all the way throughout the movie in the scene where the human transformed to a werewolf i thought they was kidding todays computer games have ten times better animations low budget is a fitting comment i would recommend wolf with jack nicholson for a good werewolf movie it has good special effects as they should be transforming to werewolf unless you wish to have good laugh i would not recommend you to watch this movie this movie is a joke
this movie sucked it really was a waste of my life the acting was atrocious the plot completely implausible long long story short these people get terrorized by this pathetic crazed killer but completely fail to fight back in any manner and this is after they take a raft on a camping trip with no gear and show up at a campsite that is already assembled and completely stocked with food and clothes and the daughters headphones additionally after their boat goes missing they panic that they're stuck in the woods but then the daughters boyfriend just shows up and they apparently never consider that they could just hike out of the woods like he did to get to them like i said this movie sucks a complete joke don't let your girlfriend talk you into watching it
i give this movie a one for it is truly an awful movie sound track of the dvd is so bad it actually hurts my ear but the vision no matter how disjointed does show something really fancy in the italian society i will not go into detail what actually was so shocking but the various incidents are absolutely abnormal so for the kink value i give it the video photography acting of the adults actors are simply substandard a practical jock to people who love foreign the main character has full spectrum of emotions but exaggerated to the point of being the children in the movie are mostly years old and they are genuine and the movie provides glimpse of the italian life
it was no sense and it was so awful i think hollywood have a lot of film like that you don't have do watch it people cutter or eater what should i say it made me sick oh my god film is about people that we don't know but feed themselves with humans they have teeths bla bla bla isn't that familiar i can bet on it you saw it in a another movie the cast was so great but i think scenario was really awful and i should say that bradley cooper was totally awesome so talented actually i said awful but i think it because of horrible scenes let me explain it did you ever eat tongue but in the film one person did it it was really awful anyway i think film would so good without that awful human eater or cutter scenes
as a long-time fan of all the star trek found this a disappointing episode and i wonder if the liberal use of flashbacks featuring will exploits both positive largely romantic and negative of pain and a a money-saving device as were many of their bottle shows in which all scenes take place on the enterprise diana also appeared at least twice on the original series deserved a better final appearance than this for her character dr kate pulaski loyal viewers the star trek world is there any other kind also were shortchanged this was the last episode of second season thus the season ended not with a bang but with a whimper
i had a feeling that after submerged this one wouldn't be any better i was right he must be looking for champagne money and not care about the final product his voice gets repeatedly dubbed over by a stranger that sounds nothing like him the editing is well just a grade above amateurish nothing more than a b or c-grade movie with just enough money to hire a couple talented cameramen and an ok sound the previous poster said the problems seem to appear in post-production dubbing etc too bad cause the actually ok for a sg never rent another sg flick unless he emails me asking for bad i miss kelly
please spare me of these movies that teach us that crime is fun and justified couple that with a vacuous script with an intense desire to be a farrelly or a coen brother plus the lives of yet another group of supposedly high school age people acting out their dawson creek-brand teen angst complete with a genxyz soundtrack that woefully tries to make the movie feel cool and we have intensely and painfully inept isn't even watered-down ferris rather watch a traffic light one scene stands out as anywhere near worth the price of admission when the betty masked girls meet a richard nixon masked friend a surreal moment priceless for the rest of it i'd rather have a toothache at least i can apply some to stop the pain
bobby is a goofy kid who smiles far too much and wants sex so he buys a van to aid in this quest the acting is lame the comedy is pathetic and the script is no more than a loosely strung chain of clich√©s and cheap thrills the makers of the film obviously wanted to capture some of the out there craziness of other films of the time but fell a long way short they even resort to bobby slipping on a banana skin because this will supposedly add comedic struggling to find a redeeming feature of the film if you like devito this is another classic devito kind of role but only a supporting actor and there for clich√© value
a family traveling for their softball league decide to take the scenic route and end up in the middle of nowhere the father is an avid photographer and when he hears of an old abandoned side show in the town he decides to take another detour to take some course the side show is filled with inbred freaks who promptly kidnap the women and leave the young son and father to fend for only cool thing about this film is how the family actually fights back against their inbred captors other than that nothing worthwhile about the film
this is a very odd film i wasn't really sure what is was about some n london lowlifes find a mute kid in the woods that they all believe is some kind of oracle and somehow makes them all in their own way change something about their lives that usually ends in disaster the film ended after about minutes leaving me feeling quite unsatisfied almost annoyed at the pointlessness of it all i didn't care about any of the characters none of them get a chance to endear themselves to the was the message am i being dim it was just too odd what happens to runner why does emilio shoot the kid that made absolutely no sense pointless can someone help me understand this mess of a film
i was looking for a cute simple comedy to pass the time but choosing this film proved to be an enormous can't write a single good thing about it first the script is stupid and not funny at all relying on tired recycled jokes and a farting turtle for laughs in my book not funny budget effects i can even call them effects with horrible cinematography in many places it feels almost like an indie film shot with no i feel sorry for the actors are pamela anderson and denise richards that desperate for some money that they've agreed to take part in this at their recent filmography it would appear so despite the outfits pamela is showing her age and as a whole they don't even come across as sexy let alone movie is not even in the so-bad-it-is-funny category just bad as if everybody involved was sick of
obnoxious eva longoria dies on her wedding day when an ice sculpture of an angel wings falls on her off the back of a truck and kills her she is then tries to ruin the relationship of her ex-boyfriend with his new girlfriend a psychic who can see unoriginal movie wouldn't be bad in a clich√©d sort of way except that character is hateful and obnoxious that she drains all of the fun out of the film its like having your ears cleaned with sandpaper to be fair longoria nor anyone else in the cast or crew isn't the problem its the god awful script that sinks the proceedings its just really really stupid
exceedingly complicated and drab i'm a bright guy but this was just too much for a tired brain it would really benefit from a few early clues as to who these people are and what they are doing probably better for the us market gc himself hinted that this alone did not supply his oscar and you can see the sand dunes are pretty the nail pulling is nasty the attorneys drunk dad is a mystery the cricket is good to difficult to write the required ten lines on this despite it being over hours long thank heavens they shortened it admittedly we don't get to the pictures much but the last film we saw walk the line was times better and i don't really like johnny cash my wife says george still looks good with the beard and a few extra pounds so i nearly there yet about now
first of all the big named actors must need the money the surgical scenes were laughable and surely they must know that people who have a little knowledge of medicine would find this utterly do not leave the room during a heart do they do the surgery in a tiny room devoid of instruments heart lung equipment and sterile techniques just a joke couldn't concentrate on the story line because of all the stupid surgery scenes no blood no personnel and then the hero doc coming in and taking over it is not a film for thinking the budget must have been limited the street scenes were ok but who was the technical like it was directed by a total idiot save your money and wait until it comes out on dvd and don't rent it
this is by far the worst adaptation of jane eyre i have seen it is uncertain whether or not the writer of the screenplay ever read the book by bronte george c scott is ridiculous and bumbling as rochester when not just plain old acting angry susannah york has the most dated hairstyle i have ever seen in a victorian movie the characters hardly speak to each other so the rich banter enjoyed in the book that is the basis for their deep intellectual and abiding love is gone the ending is rent the timothy dalton version instead it is so true to the book like having the novel read aloud to you dalton is superb as rochester g c scott is laughable
only children below the age of should be allowed to see this film the rest of us should take a book player or just take a nice nap to endure the experience of this event this can be best summed up as a blown-up tv movie being distributed into theaters children will want to see this film and they will like and be amused by the movie
when i saw the preview for this on tv i was thinking ok its gonna be a good werewolf movie but it was not it was not scary at all acting was good plot was horrible the military bid was just plain stupid i think the sci-fi channel could of done better than this piece of crap the movie made it sound like arron was going to turn into a werewolf instead he turned psycho and bit some throat out if you have read some of my other reviews on other movies there all positive but this one is not simply because the story was terrible one out of max im sure you all were expecting some werewolf flick but i bet you didn't expect this beyond loch nes was way better than this movie heck any movie thats on the sci-fi channel is better than this movie
to be fair they did as well as they could with a budget of five shillings and sixpence but the dialogue was more cheesy than of emmental and the cgi was a little old hat now maybe if some of the actors were not so perfectly chiselled out of granite it would have made the film a little better too to say this was awful is to do this film a mis-service if you want to see something that is totally execrable you gotta sit and waste a couple of hours of your life watching sickle that is soo mind numbingly awful its actually large alcoholic beverages are deriguer though any road up i enjoyed this film and its gotta be worth a look if you have not seen it yet just don't expect anything along the lines of jurassic lost world or apocalypto
my girlfriend picked this one as a southern born and raised african american i found this plot and premise totally without credibility to believe that class and racial biases would be so easily and comfortably suspended would only come from someone totally unfamiliar with the ante-bellum south totally absurd i wonder how they got a good actor like harvey keitel and a good actress like andie mcdowell being southern knows better to participate in this crap
the acting was horrendous as well as the screenplay it was poorly put together and made you almost want to laugh at the several terribly acted out murder scenes the ending was even worse everyone kept dying but somehow the ending made it look like everything was perfectly ok they did not give enough history about the obsession the teacher had etc the movie needed more time to perhaps develop a better storyline the only reason i give this is that i kind of feel bad for the young actors they needed better coaching they could have really made this an ok film but the screenplay and acting failed miserably
this is your typical priyadarshan bunch of loony characters out on some silly mission his signature climax has the entire cast of the film coming together and fighting each other in some crazy moshpit over hidden money whether it is a winning lottery ticket in malamaal weekly black money in hera pheri kodokoo in phir hera pheri etc etc the director is becoming ridiculously predictable don't get me wrong as clich√©d and preposterous his movies may be i usually end up enjoying the comedy however in most his previous movies there has actually been some good humor and hera pheri being noteworthy ones now the hilarity of his films is fading as he is using the same formula over and over are good tanushree datta looks awesome rajpal yadav is irritating and tusshar is not a whole lot better kunal khemu is ok and sharman joshi is the best
a meteor crater lake our title awakening a plesiosaur who to snack on the hick population california that hick capital of the world bad movies and then the crater lake monster which somehow managed to escape featuring grating acting a decent stop-motion beast and more this is a dreadful piece of low budget movie the movie is guilty of many crimes the biggest one is arnie and mitch two obnoxious rednecks who serve as our comic relief they bumble around fight to stock banjo women and act like pathetic excuses of humanity the characters are so bad they should count as a crime against humanity
i once thought that the stoned age was the worst film ever made i was wrong hobgoblins surpassed it in every way i could imagine and a few i couldn't in the stoned age i hated the characters in hobgoblins i hated the actors and everyone else involved in creating this atrocity i won't include a teaser to this film i'm not that cruel i couldn't subject innocent people such as yourselves to such torment in fact any discussion of plot pertaining to this film is senseless and demeaning words i would use to describe this film are as follows insipid asinine and conclusion please don't watch this film i beg of you from one movie lover to another no from one human being to another please for the sake of your own sanity and intellect do not watch it destroy any copies you come across
first ifc runs town and country and now this the difference between that stinker and this pink panther rip-off is that town and country was watchable this can only surmise that the cast signed up for this so they could goof off in europe on somebody dime belushi is especially irritating his scene with candy a z-grade dom deluise was torture speaking of torture five minutes of the talentless shepherd and i bet the prisoners at gitmo would crack like real crime this being green-lighted is character a mousy wife who takes a monte carlo casino for a half-million bucks if you buy that i have some oceanfront property in arizona you might be interested in
i am a huge fan i even enjoy horror films some people consider as stupid i also like gore the more the merrier as long as it has a reading the other reviews on the site i was sure this film was going to be a little gem but much to my disappointment it proved to be one of the most pointless films i've ever acting was terrible the dialogs were stupid the plot was pointless the special effects were useless and the editing was probably done by someone who has been dead for the past years usually i find that all these characteristics make a great b horror movie but not in this waisted eur to get this dvd you actually enjoy pointless gore for example the violent films avoid at any cost
i don't know how this movie received so many positive reviews on this site i'm a big vonnegut fan and am very familiar with the story this showtime original film bastardized beyond belief but even if i wasn't the poor acting very poor casting astin as the brilliant athletic and all around individual harrison the completely generic and sub-standard writing rendered this tripe barely watchable someone pointed out how cute that maculay culkin line was if you read that and thought that was pure comic brilliance it probably was the most intentionally funny part of the movie maybe you'll like this movie but if you're a vonnegut fan or not completely insane don't see it please
no wonder pamela springsteen gave up acting to become a full-time photographer a much better idea to have her behind a camera than in front of one while this movie is not without its interesting elements from hell etc it is outweighed by flaws for one thing angela the murderous counselor appears to be about the same age as the campers having an older more threatening camp director would have done a lot for the film and then you have the murder scenes the budget was apparently too low to execute most of them properly pun intended although drowning someone in an outhouse toilet is certainly original but overall there are a ton of movies out there that are fun to spend an hour and a half of your life watching
and a budget and this movie still looks like it was made for you can tell from the first frame to the last that he didn't care one bit about the movies continuity or plot he was just happy to be making a zombie movie the end result shows is a lazy film maker who loves zombie movies it could have been great if he just had of given a care the end result is endless zoom ins on poorly done gore and even more poorly produced metal plays over happens when you combine high hopes big dreams a decent budget hard work and one idiot behind the camera
i have never watched a movie in so little time the only salvation was the fast forward function on the dvd unit it was like watching a poorly produced cbc film there was obviously no money for lighting filming sets location scriptwriters editors actors oh there was absolutely no story either i need to write ten lines of comment bad awful horrible wretched anguishing tortuous bilious nauseous sickening fromage disgusting flimsy icky yucky pukey stinky smelly vile putrid all-thumbs-down and i don't know if i can keep on going to complete all ten lines of just how bad this piece of crap-o-matic production was
i purchased this video quite cheaply ex-rental thinking that the cover looked quite nice and it was nice but the movie is trash i can handle b-grade i sometimes even enjoy a good b romp surf nazis must die is a classic example of how entertaining the genre can be but this was just bland bland bland incredibly dull scenes were broken up too sparsely by good wholesome cheap porn and entertaining dream horror sequences this movie has very little to offer
this movie is yet another in the long line of no budget no effort no talent movies shot on video and given a slick cover to dupe unsuspecting renters at the video you want to know what watching this movie is like grab a video camera and some red food dye and film yourself and your friends wandering around the neighborhood at night growling and attacking people congratulations you've just made hood of the living dead now see if a distribution company will buy it from have seen some low budget shot on video films that displayed talent from the filmmakers and actors or at the very least effort but this has neither avoid unless you are a true masochist or are amused by poorly made horror movies
starts really well nice intro and build up for the main characters but after about minutes the charm is character is in the same mould as the main protagonist from american pie and loser without the supporting cast or innovative storyline that made the pie movies more of a commercial be honest acting was pretty poor keaton daniels and faris did their best but had no substantial plot or script to get their teeth into the movie just plods on without any pace or clear logical storyline justifying its ending is about as predictable as they come so predictable i've ticked the spoilers box for this one advice avoid at all costs unless you really really have nothing else to to or watch and even then you'll feel the producers just cheated you out of an hour and a half of your life
what a bad bad movie i tried watching without fast failed after about minutes i stopped the movie went on-line to see how many minutes this disaster was minutes whew it was a confusing boring movie i don't think anyone can get knocked down by getting hit with a fluorescent bulb much less gutted by one the one funny thing is that i watched the killer cut version of the movie the box boldly states more blood more sex more terror than the theatrical release yikes if this movie was horrible with all those claims i wonder just how lame the un-killer cut was if you want to see a great movie about the world of the living the world of the dead watch any of the night of the living dead series
this is a film of immense appeal to a relatively well-defined group which i am not a part i went to a preview of this movie not knowing what to expect i ultimately found it disappointing the history of a dreadfully dysfunctional downright twisted hungarian jewish family is not my cup of tea an epic saga like this should really provide its viewers with something more in the end ultimately pictures such as this are about the human condition this picture cast almost no new light on any of its more meaningful facets
i remember watching this film in the eighties as a teenager but i wanted to see it again because traci lords is now earning a living as a serious actor what the hell was going on in the eighties this is a really bad film with bad taste and bad actors definitely a waste of money
what a complete waste of time the movie starts as a clone of the saw series but with even worse acting melissa joan hart is absolutely horrible the ending is ridiculous and the story contains no twists not plot surprises and just a plain bad ending i liked some of the characters and i was hoping for everything to be tied together at the end it just doesn't happen a total wrestler ending with none of the good acting i can't believe i spent the time watching this not fun as some people put it a guy in a mask kidnaps people who are connected and forces them to figure it out the connection is a stretch and he should have shot the main actress first
they're showing this on some off-network well crap while it is not as bad as the b-movies they show on the sci-fi network on saturdays but still a fairly large pile of crap the acting is passable the plot and writing are fairly sub-standard and the pacing is entirely too slow every minute of the movie feels like the part of the movie where they're wrapping things up before the credits not the peak of the movie the denouement also large portions of the cast look way to old for the age range they're playing the whole thing is predictable boring and not worthy of being watched save your time not even worth the time it takes to watch it for free
this is the most cliche ridden and worst romantic comedy i have ever seen every scene is cringe worthy and the two lead actors corey and danny are soo annoying corey is very dumb and naive and should have never listened to false campbell and the killer from urban legend are the only redeeming qualities in this poor attempt of a film danny paras looks in his late thirties and the girl trying to bed corey looks as if still in in australia this film is called too smooth there is nothing smooth about this film at all avoid
sorry this movie is just a cheap tv-production i saw very much promotion material and expect a professionell movie like stormriders what i was presented was a low-budget-movie like xena or hercules on tv no atmosphere very boring more then worse fight-scenes some good ideas not more i hope i will get the chance to make a movie like this and then i show how to do such a asian-tips musa the warrior stormriders shaolin soccer battle royal versus for my bad english
while being a great james arness western this film has gone down as the worst alamo film ever made the story was terrible inaccuracy all through it and just downright untruths to boot continuity was cast to the four winds anybody catch the cannon sequence the mexicans were dumb enough to fire cannons that obviously had mud and ramrods still sticking out of the tubes come on then there is brian ridiculous hat costumer must of been away or something or just out of their mind
you want to see the movie the gamers by dead gentlemen productions this is not that movie this movie is not funny it is a waste of of the good comments here seem to be written by disguised false third parties the people who made this movie seem to be attempting to synthesize fake movie is not a well done mockumentary comparisons to spinal tap or christopher guest are movie is so mean-spirited that i cannot imagine anyone familiar with the subject matter finding it funny being able to laugh at yourself is an important quality but if you are the ones being lampooned in this manner you'd have to hate yourself to enjoy movie is not offensive because of its grand satire of taboo topics but because of its constant pathetic banality
okay i saw the sneak preview of this stupid movie first off the movie is so posed and not real they are all acting they can't sing they are way too full of themselves its awful yes kids like to might enjoy but its really stupid i mean they say their manager is a kid and there record label is fake its stupid don't see for the set up and directing not so bad it is a cute documentary but it documents a stupid thing see this if you don't really like good music also very corny not even tasteful i hate to be so this really is a piece of junk
i have to say i am really surprised at the high ratings for this movie i found it to be absolutely idiotic the mother gets visions when she touches certain things or people and one thing she touched twice made her vision continue just seemed so ridiculous deedee performance was awful i thought she was very irritating the girl who played lori did a good job and so did most of the supporting cast for what they had to work usually love lmn and am very open minded when it comes to movies but this movie seemed to have a ridiculous plot and over the top acting and it just was not for me
this film has the kernel of a really good story the work of the men and women of the coast guard especially in the north pacific is the stuff of heroes and legends this film mucks up a good story with three endings satisfying a couple of unneeded and pointless bar fights and two alleged romantic relationships that have as much spark as dead campfire the rescue scenes are great even if the computer generation is hokey and the scenarios are pretty unreal but the backstory is lame and disappointing costner is good especially his hand acting for it ashton kutcher is flat but not terrible the main female characters are one dimensional the best female is one of the coast guard sailors in the rescue center and on camera for about two minutes in the whole film it could have been an excellent film and costner needs one
this adaptation positively butchers a classic which is beloved for its subtlety timothy dalton has absolutely no conception of the different nuances of character i get the feeling he never even read the book just sauntered on set in his too tight breeches and was handed a character summary that read grumpy broody murky past he plays rochester not as a character or as a real person but as an over the top grouch who never cracks a smile until after he gets engaged at which point he miraculously morphs into a pansy there is no chemistry the only feeling that this adaptation excited in me was incredulity and also sympathy for charlotte bronte who is most definitely turning in her grave go and reread the book rochester has a personality and by the way a passionate love scene does not mean you have to eat her face
i can't believe that this movie even made it to video and that video rental stores are willing to put it on their shelves i literary asked for a refund take away the fact that the movie has no historical truth it and it is still the worse movie ever found in a video store it is not even good enough to be called a b rated movie do not waste your money or your time on this movie just listing to the voice over and the horrible music made me sick anyone involved with this movie should be pulled from the union gives the industry a black mark but after watching most of this movie i really don't think anyone involved is a union member
wow i hated this movie the subject matter should have resulted in a really fine film and the lead actor was definitely sensitive and talented enough to handle the topic but the script if there even a script is a mess this is less a movie than a random slide show that goes nowhere i'd say it goes nowhere fast except that actually the longest minutes you'll ever sit through as i've mentioned the lead actor is good so is faruza baulk as his sometimes-harsh-but-ultimately-loving-and-accepting mother the film makers have a lot to answer for here because this is a mess a real i really wanted to like this movie but basically out-takes from a movie that never got made skip this one it wasn't even worth the i shelled out for pay-per-view
honestly i can't be bothered to spend my time writing about this milestone of cinematic incompetence life is simply too short what i will say is that alone in the dark succeeds in only three things it will make you laugh but for all the wrong reasons it manages to throw several useless plots into the air but dropping all of it utterly disgraces the classic pc game on which it is supposedly based by being a complete failure in all aspects of boll if that is indeed what you are thinking proctology here what on earth are you doing in a chair
the subject matter seems pretty dated today adapted for tv from rona book we trip and stumble through a fantasy existence four college students get deeply involved playing a live version of the board game mazes and dragons on dungeons and dragons one player a young tom hanks enters the fantasy world too deep his co-players must come to his rescue and save him from self inflicted wallace wendy crewson and chris makepeace round out the foursome support cast is made up of veteran actors like murray hamilton vera miles anne francis and susan this date it seems lumbering and tame but the highlight of watching is seeing tom hanks between his bosom buddies salad days and his big splash in splash on the silver screen the youngest of viewer will get most enjoyment
this movie will confuse you to death furthermore if your a denise richards fan don't even think of renting this movie besides getting top billing by being on the cover and about minutes of air time if that she has nothing to do with the movie or the many messed up plots
this is the version that even the author hated because so schmaltzy they gave it a happy ending and changed a lot of the dialogue and just a big pile of saccharine the stage manager is quite good i believe he originated the role but everyone else falls into that acting style of the that is really just posing the one great the music this has one of the best scores ever recorded and worth seeking out in a record shop overall i think the spalding eric penelope miller version is far superior
up with robert pretentious altman was he saving on lighting everything was so dark in this boring movie that it was laughable i mean have you ever seen a office where everyone works by waste your time in fact don't waste your time with anything altman makes all a pretentious waste of film
this is the most messed up entry on imdb that i've yet to stumble across all the previous reviewers act like this is the movie this is not the movie rather merely a featurette an extra on the dvd of the movie the one it also nowhere near being the minutes that listed here as in actuality barely over minutes of how cool jet li can do martial arts and his reflections on the movie so yeah this imdb entry is quite a bit fubar don't listen to any of the other reviews as they are all wrong you can trust me because i never feed you dear reader the truth i guess u can say that i'm the one reviewer that matters
i tried as hard as i could to sit all the way through this irritating mess but i just couldn't do it brad dourif absolutely sucked as the lead and all the supporting cast were only marginally worse whole thing is just ludicrous from the awful acting to the laughable fx to the stupid waste of time don't bother root canal therapy would be more enjoyable bamboo slivers under the fingernails would be a lot more pleasant a uwe boll movie would be only a little worse than this get the idea
before watching this film i had very low expectations and went to just see the cars eventually i even regretted going for that reason plot is almost non-existent character development is non-existent so many clich√©s and so much jaw-dropping cheesiness existed in the movie that i could only stare and wonder how it was even released if not for the exotics i wouldn't have even rated this movie a an attempt at a coherent story line is destroyed by the sheer absurdity of this elite racing cult and the laughable characters that make up its members in fact the plot is so predictable and simple-minded that an average child could foretell the majority of the storyline bad acting bad plot bad jokes bad see it play gran turismo hd instead and it'll satiate your thirst for fast sexy cars without leaving a bad aftertaste
i only gave this ridiculously titled comedy horror flick a because several famous porn stars of the past appear in it a group of tourists supposedly on vacation in ireland but actually in canada run afoul of a cannibalistic inbred mutant something or other and the plot is more or less right out of the hill have eyes ands wrong turn only problem is unless i miscounted only one mutant on display and he isn't all that impressive sort of like the potbellied mummy in that homemade film from about five years ago some gory but silly deaths help but the film is strictly amateur night and boring beyond belief the ending is predictable and has been done to death no pun intended
okay just by reading the title you would think that it would be a good movie well at least i did it started out good but became so boring after the first half hour tells a story about a mother that is so desperate for her daughter to become a cheerleader that she will go to any lengths to get what she wants the only problem is that her friend is the girl in the way she always wins the competitions therefore pushing the mother further towards eliminating her after talking to a hitman the mother decides that the girl needs to be roughed up a bit so actions are taken but she eventually gets cast is awful and the movie drags on too long with nothing happening don't waste your time watching
the wicker man i am so angry that i cannot write a proper comment about this plot was ridiculous thinly tied together and altogether-just lame nicolas on you i assumed that since you were in it that it would be at least decent it was felt like huge parts of the movie had been left on the cutting room floor and even if complete-the movie was just outlandish and the end you're left mouth agape mind befuddled and good taste offended i have never heard so many people leave a theater on opening day with so much hatred people were complaining about it in small groups in the mall four floors down from the theater near the entrance that heard it compared to glitter american werewolf in paris and gigli my boyfriend was so mad he wouldn't even talk about
i had absolutely nothing to do the past weekend and tagged along with my friends to check out a movie and since the only movie we'd not seen was inspector gadget we decided to go in for mistake this is a movie that might appeal only to kids oh and not like i don't enjoy movies targeted at the younger audience but this movie had absolutely nothing to hold my attention if you have nothing to do at home go to sleep better than wasting hard-earned cash on this go check out the film if you're a kid or if you're a parent with a kid
i agree with other users comments in that the two main roles were well acted that being the guy that played gary gillmore and role too bad the story was so boring not hearing about the story i knew nothing of gary gillmore before the movie so i didn't know what to expect i thought it would be something like dead man walking or the chamber but how wrong i was the whole movie was just talking talking and talking about their mom and dad the only cool scenes were the flashbacks where the dad would lose his temper that was the only interest i got from this borefest
if this is the first of the nemesis films that you have seen then i strongly urge you to proceed no further the sequels to nebula prove to be no to believe considering this entry is bottom-of-the-barrel this movie tries but just not worth your time folks take a nap instead
this is one of the worst movies i have seen to date the best part was christian j meoli leonard attempting to act jumping up and down outside the bar kind-of like i wanted to do on the dvd to spare the rest of humanity the agony of watching this shitty film it has a great cast so you keep watching waiting for it to get good i mean with sean astin andrew his part perfectly did a great job too bad it was in this film kyra sedgwick bevan ron livingston chad ren√©e zellweger poet put her name on the cover she has a total of line and less then seconds in the whole the cast had any dignity they would go out and buy all the copies of this film and burn them along with writer director george hickenlooper and writer john enbom
they had an opportunity to make one of the best romantic tragedy mafia movies ever because they had the the story but the great director john huston was too preoccupied trying to mellow out this missed trying to find black humor as often as possible which diluted the movie very also they were so uncaring with details like sound and detailed it was the age of the director who passed away two years later
this film is quite boring there are snippets of naked flesh tossed around in a lame attempt to keep the viewer awake but they don't best thing about the movie is lena does a masterful job handling her character but day-lewis garbles most of his clearly had no idea how to film this the incongruities in bouncing between domestic issues and political crises are badly matched character attitudes change without explanation throughout badly disjointed
the complaints are valid to me the biggest problem is that this soap opera is too aimed for women i am okay with these night time soaps like anatomy or ugly betty or west wing because there are stories that are interesting even with the given that they will never end however when the idea parallels the daytime soaps aimed at just putting hunky men diggs tim daly and chris lowell into sexual tension and romps and numerous ridiculous difficult situations in a so-called little hospital it seems like general a female counterpart to baywatch that was what men wanted and they had it so if this is what women want so be it but the idea that this is a high brow show something men will watch is unrealistic
in english since swedish is not saw this movie with extremely low expectations and i can sadly inform you that the movie barely lived up to much as i loved to see janne loffe karlsson on the big screen again the writers should have realized early in the scriptwriting process that seven people falling into the water isn't original or funny the story is very thin and the jokes are used and predictable the ones that ain't is just plain boring i smiled like three times during the entire placement of swedish findus products is funny why not just a big sign saying findus made it kanal doesn't need to be seen at the cinema or on dvd just wait for it to air on tv it wont take too long
the author sets out on a journey of discovery of his roots in the southern tobacco industry because he believes that the and deservedly forgotten movie bright leaf is about an ancestor of his its not and he in fact discovers nothing of even mild interest in this absolutely silly and self-indulgent glorified home movie suitable for screening at drunken family reunions but certainly not for commercial or even non-commercial release a good reminder of why most independent films are not picked up by major studios because they are boring irrelevant and of no interest to anyone but the director and immediate circles avoid at all costs
this movie rivals plan as one of the dumbest movie ever made always be concerned when the same person is star director producer writer stuntman and editor unfortunately justin kreinbrink did all jobs imdb shows that he and his father were western stunt men so maybe that was the problem just one example from the film in the film the sheriff has to take a witness to another town for protection of course the bad guys find out and are waiting for them but what happens the good guys are riding along and a shot rings out and hits a tree near them when the camera shows us the bad guys they're all just sitting on a log chatting wrong with this could go on perhaps this film was meant as a comedy if so it didn't do that well either
the only reason i dvrd this movie was because i live in cleveland and shaq plays basketball for us now and i've always heard how awful it was the movie did not disappoint the best parts were outfits the worst parts were well just about everything else my year old son and i just squirmed and couldn't look at the screen when shaq started rapping and we kept wondering why max didn't wish for kazzam to fix that front tooth of his but for all terribleness we just couldn't stop watching it the story sucked you in like a black hole or quicksand or a tar pit it was hypnotic but it was worth it for the laughs and just to say that we actually watched kazzam
ok the movie is good but i give it a because the idea of a computer virus becoming an organic virus is pure fairy tale this kind of crap just adds to those uncomputer savvy paranoid delusions that a computer virus is exactly like an organic virus first of all strings of code and dozens of and add up to computer virus an organic virus is much more complex even though way tinier though considered one of the simplest forms in the universe organic attach burrow into your cells and attach themselves to the rna then change your own rna code explain to me how something like that could be processed from a monitor maybe the radiation has some effect on the cornea that turns your eyeballs into these viruses i could see that but obviously the writer didn't think of that
can i give this a minus rating no well let me say that this is the most atrocious film i have ever tried to watch it was painful boringus maximus the is well hidden in several sub-levels of nebulosity i rented this film with a friend and after about thirty minutes of hoping it would get better we decided to fast forward a little to see if things would get any better it never gets better this film about some dude getting kidnapped by these two girls sounds interesting but in reality it is just a bore nothing even remotely interesting ever happens if you ever get the chance to watch this do yourself a favor try plan nine from outer space instead
admittedly parsifal is not an opera that can appeal to everyone although it is a favourite of mine knappertsbusch in particular entire approach is so static whenever the music suddenly begins to swell syberberg keeps the cast moving at the same pace the takes on amfortas and klingsor are endless whatever happened to film editing the result is physically exhausting to watch the viewer is never spiritually transported your impulse is to rush home and play a recording again to confirm that wagner got it right syberberg got it wrong and that set decoration with those clever reminders of anti-semitism will there ever be a viewer of this film with no prior knowledge of wagner
it could have been a morbidly fascinating look at the life of one of most notorious serial killers but sadly it doesn't even come close terrible editing direction bad acting you name it this movie is literally about minutes of plot stretched into the only redeeming quality is bruce davidson as the father but not nearly enough to save this stinker a out of
this movie displayed more racial hatred of jews by david mamet than i ever encountered in an american film the sterotypes are so over the top that my ability to continue watching died i was so disappointed at calling a bunch of men sitting in a new york jewish center cleaning weapons heros that common sense prevailed and i stopped i am at the concept that jews are not americans and different i suggest that mr mamet is one of the causes of hatred not a healer of same
i have seen this movie many times recently read the book the movie is based on and every time i see it i just want to slap all four of them the fact that they don't clue in to the fact that tom character is flipping into his persona just acting in character outside of the gaming session that and the fact that after three months of therapy just destroy all that and feed his delusions these kind of people are what give rpgs a bad the corny love ballad and the music done by cat on a piano and stop us if we get too annoying are almost enough to set your teeth on edge
carly pope plays jj a newly promoted food critic whose flamboyant overbearing mother moves in with her jj aghast at this turn of events then blackmails restaurant owner alex to entertain her mother in exchange for maybe reviewing his dying restaurant alex predictably falls for the daughter while warming to the mother there are numerous problems with this movie the characters are universally jj is a self-serving hateful character her mother superficial and shallow colleagues at the magazine are bitchy and opportunistic the underlying message of an woman unable to make it on her own without male assistance is bad bad bad the acting is uniformly dull the script uninspired the films only saving grace is the setting of new york city i would so not recommend this film
this should not have been listed as a colombo because in my opinion it does not resemble any of the other colombo ever made this should have been listed as a movie starring peter falk and not playing the caracter of colombo because it does not do justice at all to our great lieutenant colombo
michael callan plays a smarmy photographer who seems nonetheless to be regarded as a perfect catch by any woman that runs across him could this have anything to do with the fact that he also co-produced the film a hero whom very difficult to empathize with so the movie is in trouble right from the start however troubles don't end there it has the production values of a tv-movie out that head made of clay or something near the end and the ending cheats in a way that i can't reveal in case anyone wants to see the movie unlikely just say that the killer knows more than we were let to know he knows
slaughter high the tale of revenge by a nerdy guy who fell victim to one of the coolest and coldest jokes in cinema history unfortunately after the promising opening the flick went straight to hell a very tedious and redundant mess with mediocre slashings and a final half hour that sucked on a whole new level of suckiness the guy who played the nerd actually killed himself shortly after the flick was released if you wanna rent the flick stop it after the prank and remember choose life
our teacher showed us this movie in first grade i haven't seen it since i just watched the trailer though does this look like a first grade movie to you i don't think so i was so horrified by this movie i could barely watch it it was mainly the scene with shirley mcclain cutting that little girl in half and then there was the boy with ketchup i was freaked out by this film now today being i probably would not feel that way i just wanted to share my experience and opinion that maybe small children shouldn't see this movie even though pg be aware of the possible outcomes of showing this to kids i don't even remember what it was about once was enough
cheap and mind-blisteringly dull story and acting not a single good line not even a line bad enough to be good and no memorable delivery even the blooper reel included with the dvd showed how inept the actors were and how little fun any of them were having the esoteric and occult basis was apathetically inauthentic and the antagonists failed to be creepy or believable the homoerotic overtones were pointlessly tame and dissatisfying and were limited to young boys caressing their chests while flaccid in their boxers i'm not gay enough to appreciate it but a little action might have at least kept me and my girlfriend awake
this movie is poorly conceived poorly acted and poorly heder is terribly annoying and cannot escape the same napolean dynamite routine self-obsessed and diane keaton plays the same manish overly obsessed mother who cares too much and yet not nearly enough about the lives of her children because i said so faris though i generally like her plays a vapid idiot in this film as daniels is passable but nothing special skip this film if you want to keep your soul
the novelty of hearing clean-cut jay leno spout four-letter words is the only memorable aspect of this formulaic mismatched-police-partners caper in collision course the pelican-faced comedian teams up with the late pat morita to track down a stolen prototype turbocharger car lover leno played a hand in the plot the two leads try hard they really do but leno is no actor and fish-out-of-water routine gets old in a hurry the film carries a bit of cheesy appeal but its worthy moments become increasingly scarce as it fills out its overlong running time fans of considerable comedic talents will feel let down everyone else will just be bored
i give this movie a as it is worse than the cult movies that deserve a proper it does not make sense to you well it doesn't have to this is another vampire movie with a stupid plot no let me rephrase incredibly idiotic plot where space cowboys with cowboy hats battle a space race of moron it get any uglier than this the only good thing in this movie was natassia malthe with her stunning norwegian beauty god i wish michael ironside and the deluise brothers would stop accepting dumb roles in dumb movies i mean at least seaquest was nice i know mr ironside from a lot of movies he has acted in movies at this date true that he was rarely in a major role but still
i saw this film when it first came out in when i was a sophomore in high school i took a date to see it i didn't get any needless to say because the film was so bad joan rivers career never tanked as badly as it deserved after making this awful unfunny crap in fact unfunny isn't a severe enough term this film is anti-funny you walk out feeling like any laughter that might have occurred was beaten out of you before it could happen this isn't worth watching out of curiosity or out of any sense of it being not even the gang at could've made this worth watching the fact that billy career survived this early suicide attempt is a miracle
what a boring film to sum it all up its was basically just nana patekar beating up his daughter-in-law karisma kapoor while she tried to flee from the village with her son can someone say boring the concept wasn't too bad but it was poorly executed the canadian locales and some of the village scenes were nicely shot however overall the cinematography came up short the story could have been great but the movie just seemed to drag on there is only so much stupidity a person can take let alone three bloody hours of best part of the whole movie was the song ishq kamina and that was only five minutes long other than that this movie was a piece of crap
oh dear this movie was bad for various reasons i was expecting to see a very low score for this film and was a bit surprised by the over-all but to rate this highly as many have is a joke once you get past the one and white movie gimmick which was a nice idea the movie drags on even at a run time of only minutes the credits sequence at the start was so annoying the van the guys suffer a flat tyre and change the wheel wow that was needed in the story how slow were the guys chasing and actually managing to wound campbell they did not seem to bother continue chasing am only too glad i got this free with a special edition of evil dead
don't bother a little prosciutto could go a long way but all we get is pure ham particularly from dunaway the plot is one of those bumper car episodes the vehicle bounces into another and everything changes direction again until we are merely scratching our heads wondering if there were ever a plot gina phillips is actually good but hard playing across from a mystified dunaway playing lady macbeth lost in the duck soup ah the an actor and there is the relative who just lies and bed and looks ghostly or dr dread filled with lots of gloom and no working remedies i'm one of those suckers who just has to see a movie to the end quoth the raven nevermore
i thought it would at least be aesthetically beautiful it was slow pretentious and boring i almost fell asleep there are some decent songs but there is this one song at the end which is just some guy yelling out yaowwww while someone taps randomly on a wooden object that being said there are some pretty songs but not worth seeing hte movie over go on itunes have the album preview it and choose the good ones the movie is some guy making tea well a slight exaggeration but you'll see what i mean if you see it that being said don't see it
it is quite simple friends is a comedy of very basic humour aimed at teenagers and young adults with unsophisticated sense of is also painfully obvious that towards the end they were desperately trying to make it last seasons most likely so they could say they beat season run the trouble with this is seinfeld had amazing seasons with great writing friends had i'm being very generous here at most or ok seasons and then abysmal became a soap opera with recycled humour and recycled character traits that weren't that good so start with then got worse at the time you saw them i find it so hard to understand why people rate this so highly it is truly awful
its like if you took the general themes of the usual suspects and fightclub take away all their style and class and mixed them together with a lot of pretentious new wave i'm intellectual so my movie must be hard to make sense of film maker rubbish mashed in a few extra styles for good measure chopped off the ending there you have i did think about it for a little bit after watching and yes it did kind of make sense however that doesn't stop it being of money waste of there as the worst movie i have ever seen with not even a bad movie novelty value to redeem it a little
hands down the worst movie i have ever seen i thought nothing would ever dethrone last action hero but this does easily the movie is about single guys who meet on sundays to discuss their sexual escapades from the weekend a fourth guy who is married and that used to be a part of the group shows up and talks about what he and his wife do nothing works in this movie the jokes are not funny but they are repeated throughout the movie the big kicker at the end of the movie is laughable avoid at all costs
you are warned this is a spoiler this movie is so bad that i doubt i can write enough lines great direction the shots were well thought out the actors were very good particularly richard pryor tho i would have liked to have seen more of him madeline kahn and john houseman were classic dudley more god bless him could have done better john ritter again i would have liked to see more of him in my opinion this failure is due totally to writer failure maybe the producer could have pulled the plug once he saw what he was creating its just too bad that so much money went into this with a little change here and there would in my opinion fixed must have paid the writers standard rates to produce one chuckle
am i is the version just a rip-off of the original i have to ask because the dvd i just bought is one of the worst films i have ever editing only exploitation aspect here is how we were ripped off for our money buying this piece of crap it is nothing more than a light-weight porn real gore no scary images just a cheaply done bit of garbage if anyone wants to see an excellent film with no name slimy gore and a decent baby done on a cheap budget but well an actual story spit was a waste of money but i'll keep it just for a is pathetic new keep this film forever just because it it sooooo bad almost a really bad worst acting real crap-movie classic
stereotypical send up of slasher flicks falls far short as supposed entertainment gerrit graham michael lerner zane busby and in fact the entire cast are totally wasted lame jokes abound and every punch line is well telegraphed the dumb one liners come at a fast pace and almost every one falls flat as a squashed grape the musical numbers only contribute to the boredom that sets in and lingers for the entire movie another negative is the claustrophobic setting entirely within the walls of an abandoned high school avoid this and seek out one of truly funny films like national golddiggers merk
this documentary begins with an interesting premise it makes an intriguing and convincing argument that the history of jesus as is commonly believed is probably a myth sadly though after priming us with this the movie completely shifts gears and becomes little more than a non-stop attack on christianity and pretty much focusing on the easy clearly has some issues with the church is a former evangelical christian and has some legit anger and this film seems to be his form of release it'd be interesting to see the first minutes expanded but as a whole the movie is disappointing
this movie is a disgrace to the major league franchise i live in minnesota and even i can't believe they dumped cleveland i realize at the time the real indians were pretty good and the twins had taken over their spot at the bottom of the american league but still be consistent anyway i loved the first major league liked the second and always looked forward to the third when the indians would finally go all the way to the series you can't tell me this wasn't the plan after the second film was completed what happened anyways if your a true fan of the original major league do yourself a favor and don't watch this junk
well because i'm a musician i thought maybe i'll check this movie out on tmc nothing else good on one of the worst mistakes of my life so far and only half done i seriously thought it was one of those soft core movies with crappy plot and crappy acting crappy filming and crappy effects but nope i don't even get the pleasure of that even the musicians weren't very good i was hoping for maybe some laughs but i wasn't sure if they were attempting to throw in one-liners or not but now i have to sit here and watch the rest just until pulp fiction starts or maybe something better and now i get to sit here typing until i have lines
i think that the shots and lighting were very poor when i watched it for the first time i thought it was the old when i really found out the true year of the film i was shocked i didn't know that there could be such a bad film made so recently thats really all i wanted to say this film had a good plot though nothing you couldn't miss out on if you would simply read the novel that george orwelll wrote all i really want to say has already been said except for this i can't believe that this film could have possibly received so many awards and gave this film a one because i felt that it was very badly made well that is all so long
harsh yes but i call em like i see saw this in the late and it was truly one of the most awful boring films i've ever forced myself to the cinematography is lovely the czech settings are truly stunning the political backdrop is enticing but unlike similar historically set stories this one failed to make the politics relevant to the story or even olin and binoche are beautiful but this film manages to make even erotic scenes plodding and slow i'm all for romance but this movie was so boring i started hoping the russians would shoot them all and put an end to my sure if i'd read the book the story would have made a bit more sense however too short to expend any more time on this one
seriously there is absolutely nothing good about this crap fest at all randolph scott a closet homosexual who lived with his lover cary grant for twelve years is at his most wooden and boring in the least role at he was clearly far too old for these romantic roles although it doesn't matter so much here because gail russell looks so much older than her years and she is so ugly due to her chronic alcoholism and chain smoking lee marvin plays his usual villainous role but it isn't enough to save this garbage thank god they don't make westerns any more they're just dated racist old movies that glamorise guns and
what horrible writing and acting no personality what you can't make a good movie with a single character hmm it was done in castaway with self this kid goes on a trip to see his father the kid jason takes a plane and the pilot has a heart attack and dies mid-flight so the kid crashes in a lake and survives then he runs around surviving in the wilderness until he gets that time he fights a bear twice the first time he fights it off in the lake the second time he makes a spear out of a branch and spears the bear two shots of fake blood spurting out of the chest reminded me of monty the holy the kid decides to kick a porcupine with predictable
some of the filmmakers who are participating in this series have made some really great films but they sure as heck are not showing much skill with this series particularly the writing ok the first season was somewhat better but these new episodes they are creating just stink i'm a huge fan of horror and in my opinion the vast majority of these episodes are total garbage nothing new or genuinely interesting few of them are visually creative just typical fabricated hollywood crap uninteresting childish poorly conceived and in some cases flat out laughable much like tales from the crypt the only good thing this series has been offering is great nudity other then that this series blows hard i get the impression sometimes that they hired a bunch of eighth-graders to write the episodes maybe they did
all i can really say is that i'm glad that i was knitting socks while watching the movie or i would be very angry for having wasted hours of my life the acting was terrible the plot was even worse there were some scenes that were meant to be serious that had my husband and i laughing out loud i highly recommend this movie to people who like to do their own version of
no doubt when madonna and guy ritchie married it was because they both thought it would help their movie careers if you've been through the ordeal of watching swept away then you know at that level it was a match made in hell after nearly years of trying to become a respected actress octress as she might have pronounced it in the next best thing she still can't get out of herself long enough to turn in a performance that anyone with taste could even call decent and the thing that makes people dislike her so much on the screen that gut feeling that her ego is so inflated that it prevents her from being able to just let go and connect with her audience if any justice in this universe she just blew her last chance
this has got to be the cheesiest stupidest most retarded monster film of all time a complete joke that this even surfaced into theaters this is sort of like watching the loch ness monster in rural america this movie deserves to be thrown in a toilet and completely forgotten john carradine shame on you the people involved in this moronic pile of trash need to be lobotomized wait maybe i'm giving them too much credit i'm sure they were lobotomized before the filming how else can one explain the utter and sheer stupidity that this bucket of crap contains don't waste a minute of your life watching this don't even waste your time sending a review
i had suspicions the movie was going to be bad i'm a fan from way back have three years of the tv series on dvd well i was right took the family to see it i really wanted to see the general jump again and some of the chase jump scenes were good but to sum it up the movie was a dumbed down tarted up version of the tv simpson was pathetic while i can honestly say that the original outfits were just as revealing jessica interpretation of daisy was simply awful sorrel booke and denver pyle must be rolling in their graves as waste your money if you are an old tried and true dukes fan like me and my three kids are you will be very disappointed
kind of drawn in by the erotic scenes only to realize this was one of the most amateurish and unbelievable bits of film i've ever seen sort of like a high school film project what was rosanna arquette thinking and what was with all those stock characters in that bizarre supposed midwest town pretty hard to get involved with this one no lessons to be learned from it no brilliant insights just stilted and quite ridiculous lots of skin if that intrigues you videotaped was with the bisexual relationship out of nowhere after all the heterosexual encounters and what was with that absurd dance with everybody playing their stereotyped roles give this one a pass like a million other miles of bad wasted film money that could have been spent on starving children or aids in africa
within minutes my whole family was rooting for goldie character to die or at least for steve character to leave her at minutes we turned it off there are only a couple of movies a year we try that turn out so annoying that we can't even stomach it long enough for the story to get i like both steve martin and goldie hawn and i remember enjoying the neil simon original so i blame marc lawrence and sam weisman combine the director of whats the worst that can happen and the writer of miss congeniality and i guess this is what we end up with
no plot crappy acting and pointless is supposed to be a horror movie no fear or suspense just boom bang gore then done some kinda marines are in the desert for some weird crappy reason and they get hunted down by those mutated beasts from the first movie which was good and should have been left it at is just another excuse for money and use of pointless violence just like the saw sequels they know no matter how pointless the plot is and the more gore they can add people will see it i miss good suspenseful horror movies come on hollywood you can do much much better
straight-to-video mess combines a gun-toting heroine grade-z effects nazis a mummy and endless lesbian footage and still boring the minute running time only seems like only good part is one of the blooper outtakes wherein the bad guys force a egyptologist into a one foot almost gets crushed under a chair leg take this snoozer back to the video store and watch televised golf bowling or tennis instead
i have seen a lot of movies in my life but not many as bad as this it is a movie that makes fun of fat people has no real story has bad actors is not funny and much more is this a movie that you would like to see i guess guess that the makers of the movie was trying to be original and creative but it looks like it was made by a year old child with absolutely no cinematic skills at all the so called funny parts is as funny as throughing pies in the faces of people or breaking wind of cource if this is the kind of humour that you like then this is the movie for waste your money on this movie
this has to be one of the worst films i have ever seen the dvd was given to me free with an order i placed online for non dvd related wonder they were given away surely no one could part with money for this some reviewers can say they found it hilarious beggars belief the person who includes it in the worst five films ever has got it spot on earth a talented actor like philip seymour hoffman could get involved in this rubbish is unbelievable mostly toilet humour and badly done at wanting to be entertained should avoid this at all costs
another trashy grade z quickie from the prolific albert pyun tim inch clint eastwood-like cop from outer space chases an ugly flying to earth and gets involved in a gang war in south bronx mercifully short but deadeningly dull with the cheesiest effects since attack of the woman they should have fired the continuity guy too note how sunglasses disappears and reappears in every second shot laughably bad but why we watch these movies it sequel vs demonic is reportedly even worse if
as a veteran of many many pretentious french films i thought i'd taken the worst the industry had to offer and was able to stomach anything but not this pointless relentless violent unpleasant meaningless the film has nothing to offer and is random hatred and aggression dressed up as pretentious art avoid at all costs
this was one of the lamest movies we watched in the last few months with a predictable plot line and pretty bad acting from the supporting characters the interview with hugh laurie on the dvd was actually more rewarding than the film laurie obviously put a lot of effort into learning how to dance the samba but the scope of his character only required that he immerse himself at the kiddie end of the pool the movie is based on the appearance of a lovely girl and great music but these are not sufficient to make good you have never seen rio or the inside of a british bank this film is for you out of
the action in this movie beats sunny bhai in gadar akshay kumar possess the superpowers of leonidus in neo in matrix along with spiderman and superman it is hilarious except for the typical akshay kumar and anil kapoor comedy i cannot see anything positive in this film the story looks like the writer told his old son to write the movie is so unreal that anil kapoors long range shooting with a shotgun is the least most mistake by the director except for the directors tashan to make this movie there is no other tashan i regret wasting my money on this movie and i would not recommend it to anybody is the least i can give on imdb or i would give it a zero
arahan adds nothing positive to the kung fu genre to compare this confused motion picture with the inspired craziness and quality of stephen films is a the fight scenes are nothing new all that is presented here has been done before and better by the likes of yimou zhang tony jaa and jackie chan fights in intelligent motion pictures need logic there seems no point serving blows that have no damaging effect as in the matrix attractive female lead so-yi yoon captivated the screen but she never convincingly conquered the physical demands of the role as ziyi zhang had done so easily in house of flying daggers having a martial arts background serves well in kung fu movies to cast actors inexperienced in these skills is a serious mistake aya ueto in asumi unless you are a very talented director which as arahan proves seung-wan ryoo is not
lauren bacall and charles boyer do not provide the right chemistry here in this is a good story here about the axis trying to obtain coal to use for the upcoming war unfortunately this part of the story is not emphasized instead we deal with a supposedly bungling boyer by the way bacall is as british as vladimir real acting kudos goes to veteran oscar winner katina paxinou as was the case with her memorable pilar in the oscar winner for whom the bell tolls paxinou again plays a spanish revolutionary but this time she is a double-crossing counter-spy for the pro-franco group she is quite a vicious character when she throws a year old child out the window she believed that boyer had given the child important material to hide
i read the novel jane eyre for the first time back in it was round that time that i saw the bbc-version with timothy dalton and zelah clarke it was an excellent version and very much like the book years later i laid eyes on this version and was horrified william hurt is totally miscast as mr rochester mr rochester is a passionate character where as william hurt portrays him as a block of ice the same goes for charlotte gainsborough it was like watching two zombies together this is story about love and passion but i couldn't see it in this version no back to the bbc-version a wonderful time is guaranteed
this is not so much film as big budget television as far as i can tell the villain is a giant swarm of chocolate covered espresso beans this theory seems to be verified by the fact that the subtitles refer to it as insomnia when first mentioned that a civilization had been wiped out by insomnia i thought wow a nihilistic martial arts film but no such luck although you have to consider it experimental cinema when the villain is strangled by an old long white eyebrows zu warriors makes exactly the same amount of sense whether the subtitles are on or off not a good sign i found the special effects to be somewhere between ray harryhausen and xena warrior princess primitive
i can't believe that in the prior comments nobody mentioned that this film is a blatant rip-off of born yesterday a man is hired to bring an ostensibly dumb blonde up to the requirements of a gangster hired gun and blonde fall in love and live happily ever after gangster is left in the lurch but born yesterday was an intelligent treatment whereas this is just so much fluff technicolor transfer to dvd is deplorable natalie kalmus would be rolling over in her grave check out the paperboy recognize him but historically interesting to see the roots of rock n roll also interesting is introduction to cinemascope a new format at the time
jude law gives his all in this beautifully filmed vampire flick which offers little else of value completely lacking in eroticism excitement or leading ladies with appeal one decent fight a few moments of mild suspense and a one-note movie waxes philisophic in a series of conversations between character and a dogged homicide detective well played by timothy spall but despite their best efforts both actors are staked to the cross of the a lesser actor in the lead role and without the benefit of oliver cinematography crocodiles would blend into the sea of low-budget vampire quickies
did they use their entire budget paying the porno stars or effects background music and the editing in general was so bad you'd think some wanna-be made the of the acting was good considering the script the innocent virgin played her part really mutants look really cool and this actually could have been a really cool flick with the right brain behind the wheel but unfortunately for all involved not the left was made better than this movie and those guys didn't even have any money good thing i didn't rent the movie myself
once again i took a chance and rented this bag of crap billed as a horror flick there wasn't one scene not one that was even remotely scarey not one sure there was some nudity but all the lesbian action got a little old i guess maybe that was suppose to be this saving grace and dan what an annoying ass bag right from the beginning i knew i was in for it when good ol dan first spoke and he was suppose to be intimidating what a laugh all in all this movie is dreadfully awful how in the hell do movies like this get made if you want a movie with a few thrills in it don't rent this one this movie is about as thrilling as the teletubbies
the egyptian movies has a lot of filmes with high level of drama or romance or comedy or action even sports ziab la ta'kohl al lam was banned in egypt because it content nudity frontal female nudity and this kind of nudity is prohibited in the egyptian movies when i saw this movies i felt down fool story nude actress bad action some horror awful colors dear friend if you wanna see a great egyptian stay away form ziab la ta'kohl al lam we have great movies in egypt we have a great actors who won a global wins like omar el sheriff or gameel rateb we have great directors like yousef shahin so believe me pall you don't need to see this movie
i found this on the shelf while housesitting and bored how can people possibly give this a not just that supposed to be a feel-good redemption film think because it doesn't work on that level either weak plot bad dialogue terrible acting just nothing there harvey keitel is decent but has nothing to work with and bridget fonda and especially johnathon schaech are just terrible the plot progression the relationship between byron and ashley makes no sense it seems like the writers wanted the plot to go a certain way and made it without actually writing in the necessary bits to make it flow only an hour and a half but minutes of your life you'll never get back
pathetic worse than a bad made-for-tv movie i can't believe that spacey and freeman were in this flick for some reason morgan character is constantly talking about and saying pussy when referring to nsync girlfriend morgan freeman calling women pussy is just awkward what the hell were the people behind this film thinking too many plot holes to imagine combined with the horrid acting confusing camera angles a lame script and cheap background music made this movie absolutely rented this flop with low expectations but well it really sucked
normally i wouldn't feel qualified to review something i only saw a half hour of but i'll make an exception for this the dialogue speak for itself some of the bad lines i sorry teacher you get an guy and bad girl right after killing cops and stealing a van full of drugs they're getting hot and how do you feel about shooting some innocent you sure know how to show a girl a good time one generic kid who ran for his life instead of helping someone gets to sum up his life and personality in this line am a chicken-twit was the usa network version my old man was right no wonder he left us actually a spoiler bad guy fire screams aargh fire
the prophecy ii there to say about it they've completely abandoned the originality of the first film and simply made a chris walken splatter film not even written by the original you've seen nr don't watch nr a real you haven't seen nr don't watch nr go see nr to experience something original and fun
quite typical for swedish movies of this type strange that the acting was soooo bad these actors usually give a good show the casting was poorly done it made you expect something won't tell you what the lead character was awful i don't know where they find her anyway stay away from this and go see den tredje v√•gen instead this is swedish action in is prime
this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen branaugh seemed to have so much trouble remembering his accent that he couldn't deliver his lines the plot was definitely not worthy of john name no wonder it was never published as a book or released in theaters i didn't even watch the whole thing i decided i didn't care who done it then realized there was no whodunit to care about
the only good thing about people i know is that it serves as a perfect example of movies that al pacino should avoid performing in the first big turn-off i had was the way in which pacino tried to portray a georgia accent at times it was weak and unattractive while in other segments it seemed too overdone dialogue and character interaction was terrible along with a weak plot the supporting cast did an extremely perfunctory job in keeping the movie interesting and within an hour i still saw no signs of a sturdy plot the story overall is a real bore and i had to slap myself in the face a few times to keep myself movie will surely bore you as at all costs
this pile of is tied in my book as the worst thing ever made i can't believe that someone actually relased this crap let alone acually made it horrible horrible horrible not even worth mentioning the damn story or any details about it how bad it actually is avoid it like sars
a mediocre sci-fi channel original picture a little squirmish but not much the nuclear powered submarine jimmy carter is on a mission deep below thick frigid ice near the north pole when it is attacked by giant super charged electric eels a member of the crew jade she has devised a way to communicate with the monsters but is not given much chance for vague reasons also among the crew keith mark sheppard and sean whalen this movie could have been somewhat better if the were not so cartoonish
i mean the word pedestrian seems the producers of the film forgot to have anything interesting happen faith domergue can do better than this she is supposed to be the mysterious vengeful cobra goddess torn by love for marshall thompson an idea eh instead a common would-be housewife of the fifties and the single flat expression she wears throughout the film makes me think they shot it all in the early morning before faith had her coffee as for the rest of the cast they are all so earnestly all-american that the result is laughable this is ground more productively covered in val lewton in the cat people i think cult of the cobra should really be titled cult of the contractual obligation why else would so many otherwise talented people sleepwalk their way though a slow-moving predictable derivative failure like this
just too many incidents of film goes from one scene to another and in nearly every one violence i am not one who is shocked by violence and to me a film without a fight in it has something missing but please not one after another my reaction was not shock or horror it was here we go again there is some semblance of a story in between the scenes of violence but two thirds of the way through the film i had switched off completely and couldn't wait for the this is the best the film makers can do they should find something else to do with their miserable lives like making shoes or delivering mail
i didn't know this was a silent movie with narration i don't care for silent movies the corny humor flickering lighting and film etc i'm sure that attributes to the low score i assigned it it was about chapter before i found any interest in this story and had i had popcorn i may have thrown it at the screen maybe this appeals to the sci-fi crowd the only thing missing was a zombie scene and a brain transplant i went with two other people on a friday night and there were a total of people in the entire theater isabella rosselinni narrated this movie the one enjoyable aspect of the movie no one left commenting how much they enjoyed this nor appreciated the unusual approach to telling this story i cannot recommend this movie
this movie was advertised on radio television magazines etc almost every hour or every issue so when we went to the kinnepolis multiplex our expectations were very high but oh boy how sad this movie is it is a movie in hollywood style about a movie in a movie shades shows so clear we aren't ready to produce big hollywood movies i am not a movie critic but i think a good movie starts with a good script and the script is a nightmare like my subject line says it is nothing and then looped you could just stare to the television as well without really seeing anything that was the feeling we've got when we saw shades shades is a bad production
this movie serves as a timely warning to anyone who thinks they can both write and direct their own movie face it you can't because that way nobody around to tell you when you hack great holes in your plot have meaningless transitions trite unmemorable dialog and manage to turn a fairly cool korean legend into a steaming pile of celluloid wanted to like this movie as a trashy popcorn movie really i did i like lots of crappy movies but once i've been forced to ask myself what the hell just happened and why dear lord why more than a few times i really can't take it any i would love for someone to explain how la became mordor for the last scene
this movie is bad i don't just mean bad as in oh the script was bad or the acting in that scene was mean bad as in someone should be held criminally accountable for foisting this unmitigated pile of steaming crud onto an unsuspecting public i won't even dignify it with an explanation of the if i can refer to it as can think of only one other occasion in some years of movie watching that i have found need to vent my spleen on a movie i mean after all no one goes out to intentionally make a bad movie do they well yes apparently they the guilty man is ulli lommel but the worst of it is that blockbusters is actually renting this to their customers be advised leave this crap where it belongs stuck on the shelf gathering dust
this movie is just lame a total waste of time and money the jokes are predictable the characters are so clich√© and the way it talks about rpg gamers is not funny as well the problem is that the writers seems not to know how a rpg game works and most important how to make jokes about this game of course there are a bunch of losers who play rpg like freaking retards and total losers but for me this is not the funniest way to make jokes about this game the story doesn't make any sense at all who cares about how long a game is being played the greatest problem in this movie is that the writers and actors didn't even try to know what rpg is about to make jokes about it i felt ashamed by watching this lame movie
everyone involved the audience should seek out the candidate to see how good this movie could have been what happened the south american story what were julie christie and kate capshaw thinking to allow their roles to be cardboard cut-outs up to now i have liked every gene hackman performance movie he was either disinterested i can hardly believe or dreadfully miscast i have also liked and defended richard gere been vilified for it but here he had no power he was never intimidating and only occasionally persuasive all in all i was very disappointed i really expected much more from this director and cast if you can't find the candidate watch wag the dog again or even bulworth
i like many other bachchan fans having been eagerly awaiting the remake of sholay this movie was not it thank god they didn't let them use the name sholay in the movie title ram remake is not worthy of the title the camera work the locations the costumes the totally out-of-place dancing the dialogue all combined to make the worst movie i have ever seen you wonder if the cast of actors agreed to make this movie because they needed money and ram gopal was paying a lot of money for the cast the only non-paid actor the ant was the only resemblance to the first movie role was totally ridiculous did he need money to pay for the wedding to ash save your money your mind and your time don't bother with this movie or the dvd when that comes out
this is kind of a weird movie given that santa claus lives on a cloud in outer space and fights against satan and his still kinda has some genuine all of them were intentional is certainly debatable though this movie is not good but i can say i really enjoyed watching would recommend this movie over santa claus conquers the martians santa claus with dudley moore and john lithgow or the santa clause with tim allen
rather then long dance sequences and close ups of the characters which made the film drag on the movie would have been better served explaining the story and motivations of the marginalisation of nubo the minister auntie mother and the dumbing down of the dynamic and important rivalry between hatsumo and mameha and hatsumo and sayuri made the movie lack any real depth if you hadn't read the book you would not really understand why sayuri loved the chairman and why mameha became her mentor at the film was stunning and the actors all did the best with the c rate script they were given but that was all that was good about this movie
ok first of all the video looks like it was filmed in the i was shocked to find out it was released in secondly the plot was all over the place right off the bat the story is confusing had there been some brief prologue or introduction the story would've been better also i appreciate fantasy but this film was too much it was bizarre and badly filmed the scenes did not flow smoothly and the characters were odd it was hard to follow and maybe it was the translation but it was even hard to understand i love chinese epic films but if you're looking for a chinese epic fantasy film i would recommend the promise stunning the plot is interesting and good character development not this film beware you will be disappointed
a bum gives a secret serviceman a tip about a secret service man in the presidential detail who plans to kill the president baloney how did the bum know the script then turns to a most detailed examination of how the secret service works but who cares most of this just slows down the movie all the chases that follow are this version of the tiresome car chases of many movies then after a lot of impossible athleticism in which our hero outruns and out-guns all his buddies we have a shootout in the toronto city hall the canadians are clearly marked with maple leafs but how did they get into this finally all is worked out but it still makes no sense
after what i thought was a masterful performance of two roles in man from snowy river why was kirk douglas replaced by brian dennehy in the sequel it just wasn't the same without spur and harrison as portrayed by douglas maybe he recognized how poor the plot returns after extended absence to find jessica being pursued by another man he could not expect any girl to wait that long with no contact from him and not find competition for a disney movie this contains foul language plus the highly unnecessary part when jim jessica shacked up without being lame quite an insult to viewer intelligence according to members of my family i'll stick with the first one and try to forget i ever saw the sequel
me and my girlfriend went to see this movie as a premiere surprise that is we bought at ticket to the preview to a movie before it opened here in denmark we sat through the hour or so and then we left the point of the movie seemed to be simply to portray the era club but it did so at the expence of character development of which there was none and plot of which there was have i been so indifferent to the characters in a music was good though so if you like to hear some good music and get a fix of that mood i guess it is ok but don't expect to get a plot of believable
i would of enjoyed this film but van damme just does the same old same old rubbish time after time poo knickers fight scenes as per usually the only thing this loser left out was the russians normally end up being killed in the end this film is utter doggy do do of the highest nature please please please van damme get some acting lessons you need them anyone who likes van damme has issues it seems sad that the only way van damme ever gets any acting work is when he co writes the film co produces the film and does the screen play for the film avoid van damme and his slicked back nasty wig i give this film a two out of ten because the one with the the sandman was better to add insult to injury i wasted a quid on this manure
how can a movie with amy posey and raechel have nothing funny in it believe it or not house bunny did this better and funnier hopefully the principals had a good holiday and got some money this movie is an embarrassment to all of them it is a clich√© from beginning to end clich√©s can work well with a script or at least an idea this movie does nothing but use clich√© after clich√© rather than ideas or script it uses the preexisting of the actresses rather than develop characters bad sad and rubbish now i apparently have to have ten lines of text for a comment really why as an it ops manager this is another example of sloppy coding
this was the worst christmas movie i ever saw i took my two small children to see this it was the darkest most dismal family has no money mom loses her job father gets killed in the bank bank robber steals family car with both kids in the back and after high speed chase drives off the bridge and drowns them in the river mom is left all alone no wonder her christmas spririt is gone christmas angels do not rescue children that have drowned and santa does not bring back dead fathers i thought this was the worst message to send children better to tell them that there is no santa than show them a movie like this
could anyone please stop john carpenter from continuously and deliberately ruining his reputation how low can you go it seems this man has lost any self episode looks like it has been done by a film student it isn't even worth beginning to talk about what was bad because it was just a borefest directed by somebody with no talent as a filmmaker or without any on mr carpenter please retire immediately with a rest of self-esteem and stop spilling out trash like this in a bad tradition from escape from to ghosts of drunk instead
the ballad of django is a meandering mess of a movie this spaghetti western is simply a collection of scenes from other much better films supposedly tied together by django telling how he brought in different outlaws hunt powers cameron brings nothing to the role of django skip this one unless you just have to have every django movie made and even that may not be a good enough excuse to see this one
i find it hard to understand why this piece of utter trash was repackaged the only saving grace in the whole thing is the body of ariauna in her sexy uniform her humour is also to be appreciated she is a definite plus but alas it would take a magician to salvage this garbage however she must be positively recognised for her heroic effort true professionalism can't say the same for her co star lilith with her whining voice that grates on your nervous system appeared disinterested gave the impression that just her presence on the set was all that was needed all said apart from performance it is indeed utter trash
blows my mind how this movie got made i watched it while i worked at home writing emails and answering the phone i only watched it because i hoped the revenge part would be good needless to say the revenge and the forced plot twists were not worth the emails during which they were watched in fact i'm not even sure what happened at the end any more the acting was as bad as re-enactment scenarios on the fbi files show by far the worst re-enactments only arrest and trial can possibly be as bad at re-enactments i didn't even know that the leading man was in third eye blind until i looked the movie up here on imdb but its obvious why he hasn't made any movies since i hope he is a good singer
i bought this movie for euro not knowing what it was all about i thought hmmm a movie named mutilation man must be if not very funny at least filled with gore it wasn't funny alright it was disturbing very disturbing and i don't mind disturbing movies but this one just didn't mean anything except that child abuse is not a good thing to do hmmm the quality of the images were terrible the was no acting just some fcked-up fcker mutilating himself for over minutes this is probably material for jurking off on extreme watch this not worth your time its just awful i wish i never bought should mutilate the guy who made this
follow-up to walking tall continues the real-life drama surrounding tennessee sheriff buford pusser but this installment plays like a lame tv-movie bo svenson takes over the lead role from joe don baker but much too mild for the part he comes off like an ambling country singer with a bat instead of a guitar good supporting actors like richard jaekel luke askew and robert doqui end up with very little to do i would give the film one-star strictly on its good intentions but the screenplay is a transparent and lazy mass of routine predicaments and the production is cheapjack followed in by final chapter-walking tall and in by the television film a real american hero
i was mad anyone made this movie i was even more angry i lost valuable minutes of my life sitting still to watch this i could have had a wax job and been more entertained at least cherri makes me laugh before it hurts i was a bit confused at first but then i caught on and realized what was going on by this time the film was half way through and yes i am a procrastinator but i always want to see things through until the end so i stuck it out i watched it all not only are the actors not as attractive as in cruel intentions they just aren't convincing i've seen my nephew cry for attention more convincingly than the supposed lust portrayed on screen in this movie if you like bad movies with bad acting watch this
i think this one sucked on ice because it left the cube and gave us to much information as to the and the original cube never left the cube and it left everything to your imagination this crap fest however gives you it all and i didn't like the acting is solid i think the reason this one was a downer was because it was done by people other than the original filmmakers if they had vincenzo natali do this prequel or even the sequel i think it would have done better and would have been more true to the source so i recommend you stay far far away from this one and hypercube another movie i don't even want to gave it a for the acting only
this is a great idea for a film but it unfortunately doesn't turn out to be a great movie what starts out as a sweet and almost goofy romantic comedy about a fluffer in love with his fluffee spirals out of control into a bizarre combination of genres and a veritable stew of plots with liberal borrowings from boogie nights thelma and louise showgirls frisk and even a curious dash of blows thrown in towards the end least the director did his research the result is not necessarily boring but in the end this slick well-produced flick doesn't quite add up to anything however the actors all do a game job with the material and there are a few good laughs at the behind-the-scenes world of gay
i really can't believe this movie is not in the imdb worst it is absolutely terrible when i originally saw it i remember talking about it in a college class and two other people had also seen it we were all telling other class members not to see it because it was so horrible by the time we were done some others wanted to see it just because they could not believe anything was as bad as we were saying it was don't be like them just pass this by i'm sure everyone involved with this movie would also prefer you never see them in this movie
slow and nice images changed one another with sometimes annoying music know bjork in background for the first of the movie if you did not have enough sleep a good time in the last of the movie director decides to bring idea of re-birth re-incarnation or else through images spiritual lovers are cutting each others bodies with knives for me it was very much disturbing and actually changed general impression of blend of abstract art and images of modern japanese mystery and director are great but weird not enjoy it at all
i like movies about morally corrupt characters but this was too much the acting wasn't great but that wasn't the real problem the issue was the sinking feeling i got in the pit of my stomach about minutes into the film these characters were hollow they had almost no depth and what little they did have was devoted to the cruelty they displayed to each other in the guise of friendship exploring the darker sides of a set of characters can be fascinating but you have to give those characters actual personalities or they are just cardboard cutouts these characters were cardboard and the picture they gave was just ugly
once again pia zadora the woman who owes her entire career to her husband proves she can't act this disaster of a film butchers the harold robbins novel ray liotta must have been hogtied and carried to the set to appear in this this at all costs i doubt even doing the thing would save it
i am oh soooo glad i have not spent money to go to the cinema on it it is nothing more than compilation of elements of few other classic titles like the thing final fantasy the abyss etc framed in rather dull and meaningless scenario i really can not figure out what was the purpose of creating this movie it has absolutely nothing new to offer in its storyline which additionally is also senseless moreover there is nothing to watch the fx'es look like there were taken from a second hand store you generally saw all of them in other movies but it is definitely a good lullaby
i just saw this movie because brady corbet is in it and i must say that i was not pleased course the computer graphics were amazing but the story line needed a little touch-up also i think this movie would have done much better with more curses and blood as well if it were rated would definitely attract more people to see what would also attract more teens teen girls would be a large close up of brady corbet on the thunderbirds poster though the movie had down points i still saw it and thought it was okay
probably encouraged by admirers of her much-better orlando potter here delivers a vehicle for herself in the worst way she writes directs stars and actually co-writes the music including a mawkish love song the film strongly resembles a high school or college project by a teenager convinced that her own intimate loves and melodramatic obsessions are as fascinating to us as to her but character is as unsympathetic as the object of her romantic obsession is unlikable and the whole film is an embarrassing display of narcissism masquerading as a celebration of the tango perhaps if she hadn't cast herself it might have worked she just can't act whether playing herself or not pretentious over-ambitious dull and silly
i'd heard about this movie a while ago from a friend and she recently got it on dvd there was a lot of anticipation and excitement as we'd both heard that this was a terrifying film really scary how disappointed was i very apart from that one scene all know which bit nothing happened i was expecting to see the woman in black a few times and for her to do a few more jumpy scenes like appear at the window or walk across the hall or all the reviews here say what a scary gripping atmospheric movie this is i just didn't see it i'm afraid maybe a difference in what people find scary in the us to here in big let down after all the hyped reviews
now i'm no film critic but i truly hated september this film was on a general basis bad with the exception of alejandro gonz√°lez segment which was the most effective and direct about the subject matter the short films were at best boring and at worst offensive the worst in my mind was youssef pretentious segment in which he compared palestinian suicide bombers to american soldiers even going so far as to suggest the suicide bombers were fighting for a greater cause the segment was completely off topic and considering seeming lack of any decency whatsoever a waste of my time and patience the idea of getting eleven different directors from different countries to make a movie featuring their views on a tragedy was good on paper but in practice it was tasteless
this is the absolutely worst piece of crap i've ever had to watch actually it was so bad that i just had to watch it cgi is sooo bad fun not even close to the shitty cgi animations in spawn how bad it is har har amazed over the fact that some distribution company actually has put money down to release this on dvd but i guess they'll get more money out of it that way cos the cost of making it can not have been more than a few hundred so awful that a kindergarten class could have made it and laugh
will i ever the ecstatic reviewer on npr made me think this turkey was another citizen kane please allow me to vent my will admit the setting presumably new york city has never been so downright ugly and unappealing i am reminded that the was a bad decade for fashion and automobiles and all the if the plan was to cheapen the characters it a film to work least in my simple estimation there has to be at least one sympathetic character only ned beaty came close and i could not wait for him to finish off nicky if a stray shot had struck mikey well it may have elicited a shrug of indifference at the can't remember when i detested a film as strongly i suppose i'm a rube who doesn't dig art flicks oh well
the fact that this movie made it all the way to the rentalrack in norway is bizarre this movie is just awful this image quality is just one teeny bit better than you get of a mobile phone and the plot is soooo bad the main character is just plain annoying and the rest just suck every person affiliated with this movie should be ashamed the fact that the people that made this movie put their name on this is extraordinary and the distributors did they even see it this is probably the worst movie i have ever seen to label this a comedy is an insult to mankind i urge you not to support this movie by buying or renting it
land of plenty is not a film it is a tombstone for the directorial career of german director wim felt it in the million dollar hotel and now land of plenty makes it perfectly clear not only has wenders lost it actually turned into a bad director creating horribly weak and superficial stories and might argue that the time you lose it comes for every director but wenders case is extreme as if he completely forget everything he knew about cinema and started all over again only to get sloppish a few words this film does not deserve your time
the story is similar to et an extraterrestrial run around on earth and tries to come back home while its stay on our planet it will create friendly ties with unlike et which exudes drama comedy poetry this movie is only fun it is indeed a pure dysney production its core audience are children the movie is more more in the visual than in the you will find some funny scenes first sighting of the town a cosmic stray toaster and the casting is experimented with special mentions to doc who rejuvenates in a mac fly character and to hurley who seems open to on the cake the main title is scored by danny elfman and like every other great composer you recognize his voice before he is even credited
this was a terrible film there was no story line whatsoever to top it all off when they couldn't explain the blood and gore only good part they threw in a few aliens i hate when directors whatever run out of ideas and then blame the aliens watch this film if you like but don't say i didn't warn you two things how could vinny say welcome when he didn't have a tongue its a pity mr jones didn't have a bigger role second thing that bugged me why were we shown vinny jones boils and him cutting them off and putting them into blue liquid then these have no further role why not i don't like to be shown something and that has nothing to do with the story line whatsoever in short bad story i wouldn't waste my time wish i'd have watched mirrors instead
unfunny radio quiz show host kyser and his mediocre band are the excuse for lugosi karloff and lorre to pick up a paycheck in this bland sporatically watchable haunted house spoof lugosi is a mystic whose seances are exposed as a fraudulent attempt to bilk an heiress fortune karloff is the butler and lorre is a professor who exposes fake mediums but it turns out that they're both in conspiracy with lugosi course kay kyser and his band of year old kids uncover the truth with the minimum of possible humor along the way not recommended to any but the absolute horror completist
it was a sunday night and i was waiting for the advertised movie on tv they said it was a comedy the movie started minutes passed after that minutes and i didn't laugh not even once the fact is that the movie ended and i didn't get even on echance to laugh please someone tickle me i lost minutes for nothing
i think that it was just pointless to produce a second part of a movie like my girl my girl was a very good movie but it is ridiculous making a second part of a movie in which one of the main characters culkin as thomas j dies the story was over after the first movie i wonder why someone tried to find a way to make the story going on that was senseless
this is the most elementary sort of traditional ghost story not even enlivened to any great extent by the use of irish locations if the great james had ever come up with a tale this thin doesn't james in fact have a story called a thin ghost he wouldn't have bothered to have it welles appears in the limp endpieces as a favour to a brace of old friends this producers his presence and the one movie industry in-joke would have earned this will-o'-the-wisp its oscar nomination this is yet more proof if any more were needed that the academy awards have never been any guarantee of merit
no wonder this was released straight to dvd here in australia no redeeming features what so ever the dialog was hokey the acting awful and the script sucked whoever thought it would be a good idea to do a sequel or follow up to the far superior john badham film wargames from the well they must of been on something cause it was a bad idea amanda walsh was good in it as the eye interest while matt lanter was good as the other main that is about it i would not recommend wargames the dead code to anyone check out hackers or the original wargames both are better than this piece of crap
just like everybody else have said the acting is awful no story or whatsoever poor directing about the sfx the degree matrix style shooting shoot is stupid enough but for each characters i mean come on gimme a break and up with all those video game scenes just to remind us a video game adaptation jesus they should have fired whoever think up this
screenwriter lisa lutz began writing the screenplay at the age of in she even in business if someone gave her another chance after this piece of crap up for the most fortunate person of ever movie sucks to no never ceases to amaze me what the turn into the fact that they made this writer put it off for a bit seriously i can write better crap than this in my so how many lines to i have to type i don't get this at all i guess a newbie i guess i don't understand why there should ever be a limit to what anyone has to a quota seriously i don't care if you have a one word even a one word response i mean c'mon this enough movie is worthless
this movie should have been named need for speed the movie for those who have not played the games need for speed is mostly about hot cars and beautiful women and almost no plot this applies perfectly to redline the only thing about this movie that was a-level were the cars the acting seemed forced and scripted the premise was flimsy at best and the plot was almost nonexistent i only really watched this movie to see how bad it was and while it was pretty bad it could have been worse and at least it was entertaining i just wish they had showed eddie griffin crashing the enzo somewhere in the movie all in all don't pay for it don't go out of your way to see it but if on showtime or hbo and there isn't anything else on a decent distraction
a scientist on an island is in deep sorrow about the loss of his son who died of kidney cancer so he thinks why not turn my dead son into a hammerhead shark well who wouldn't a little hard to cope with the fact that the hammerhead shark killing everybody is constantly being called paul also william cast as a kinda hero lacks credibility on the other hand there are a few hot chicks who make you actually look at the screen while shark paul bites another one to death as a matter of fact i find bad b-movies quite amusing but for my taste it would have been a much better movie if it was made for say bucks less then it might have been fun
i bet you gene simmons and vincent pastore negotiated in advance how many episodes they would be willing to appear in isn't just too contrived for gene to switch to the ladies team and then throw himself on his sword and big pussy what the hell was that look at me i'm a rat double episode crap all that clich√© mafia come on the big names voted off just happened to already have received money for their charity and got a custom tailored exit hmm this is not reality but staged drama mark other show survivor also raised questions for me when johnny fairplay stages his departure when he clearly had just a short time before his child is to be
terry west had a good idea this movie he just didn't flesh it thru there are endless shots of the creepy looking exteriors that go on forever and probably to pad the running time also at this school there are only students misty mundae is good as usual but this film will always belong to ruby larocca is the only reason to watch the film in the beginning if the script centered on her interesting character we'd have a movie to watch she is so gorgeous good news for dvd buyers terry earlier better film blood for the muse is a special feature one thing i'd like to say is that this movie feels like someone not good at delivering the punch line at the end of a long joke for the ending feels that very same way then again just watch this for ruby larocca
where to even start the horrendous acting the nonsensical plot the bargain basement effects the completely loathsome characters the choppy editing the headache-inducing casio keyboard score the embarrassingly racist remarks it charlie back off jackie chan the constant misogyny i am a lifelong horror fan and i have no problem at all with the current torture-thon trend of movies however this is a poorly-made piece of garbage i think i suffered more pain watching this than the characters did dying in it if you like girls being forced to eat stir-fried penis really poor soft core porn and think lines like i'm gonna find that and staple her shut are clever live feed is for for me i feel the need to go wash my eyes out with oven cleaner to prevent from ever seeing this movie again
what the hell is in your minds this film sucks each minute i was getting more and more bored i strove to watch the end because i hope something at least would at last happen but instead of that i got amazed how dull the end was treated what is this story about this bloody bogeyman how comes he doesn't die he is a bloody human being for sake a mere boy that killed his silly sister years ago then what his stay on a psychiatric hospital made him immortal this film a fascinatingly stupid a must of silliness i'm gonna resell it right now to some silly guy who will understand this silly film
this animated inspector gadget movie is pretty story is very there is little of the characters are given little to nothing to movie is mildly entertaining at really doesn't go any where and is watchable but only just and is nowhere near the calibre of the animated tv show from the not a movie that bears repeat least in my only about minutes long including i guess a good in the tv characters are not worth rooting for the wanted inspector gadget to save the really just my me inspector last case is a disappointing
i love watching jerry as much as the rest of the world but this poor excuse for a soft-core porno flick is needlessly offensive lacks anything resembling wit and serves merely as a vehicle of self-promotion for springer even though it runs a quick minutes the film drags hideously and i should have had the common sense to walk out simply atrocious
having watched minutes of this movie i was bewildered having watched minutes my toes were curling i simply couldn't believe it the movie is really awful in fact it is so awful that i had to watch all of it just to be during this i came to realize that it reminded me of a bunch of danish so-called comedies from the and the pattern is as follows take one extremely popular comedian make a script putting this comedian in as many grotesque situations as possible add a bunch of jokes one-liners and spice it up with a couple of beautiful young girls film that and you have a success i wouldn't know if this movie was a success but unlike the danish tradition which died quietly a few great comedians it seems that there is a market for this kind of movie in the us
what is it with americans and their hang-up with religious gobbledy-gook to think this was a best-selling novel is incredible but to pull it off as a movie you really need good acting and a script that delivers in this case all the good actors have gone to heaven and we're left with kirk cameron as a cnn-type trying to discover why a lot of people have simply disappeared oh yeah a subplot about an evil world conspiracy and famine or something the good news is that this is done so cheaply and with such inane dialogue that it has sheer entertainment value in all of its unintended laughs not recommended for anyone with a iq
i thought before starting with these movie that it might be a good one but when i started with it i found it really awful they said movie is being made in afghanistan but i think of the movie is shot in india you can see indian made cars you can see lars drinking indian water brand hindi written on the road you can also see temples in afghanistan its really funny and many more stuff which proves its not shot in afghanistan i think one should not waste time watching this movie pure time waste i would recommend to do something else instead of watching this movie or may be might heart is better idea but don't watch this waste of time
kirstie alley looking a bit slimmer but only a bit is in this mess along with a man who is a macguyver lookalike bleached blond hair and all the premise of the movie is about an older woman who cannot get her screenplay produced due to age discrimination so she sends in her younger nephew to pose as the writer not an original idea and not a very good movie with lousy acting inane dialogue and a ridiculous plot there is another plot concerning a writer with a crush or admiration for character and why this is included is a mystery the actor who portrays brother is so wooden and miscast it was torture to watch their scenes what is there to say about this film avoid it
my wife and i like to rent really stupid movies and watch them with our friends for a laugh we saw this one on and decided to add it to our netflix list now when i say this movie is awful i mean it in a good way everything about it the acting camera-work story costumes is just so cheezy and low budget but thats what makes it so good i think in one scene the actors looked like they were actually walking in place i really hope that whoever made this film wasn't serious when they made it because if they were then that would just be sad if you like to watch really stupid horror movies just to make fun of them then i recommend this one
although it has been years i still remember the complete waste that comprises the entire plot of the movie unfortunately i came across this movie after my friends and i selected it while browsing through the new releases at blockbuster we decided to pick the movie because it was the only one we all had not seen and it sounded like it may be enjoyable although it has been quite some time since i viewed the movie i still remember the lack of plot there is no true plot and complete waste of time that was spent watching the movie if you are in the video store and this film catches your eye walk on and find a better movie if you did end up seeing this movie i understand your pain
nicole eggert was listed as the star of this despite micheal dorn stacey keach being much bigger stars than this is a bit of a spin on the alien lands on earth film eggert plays the girl who feels sorry for an alien being chased by the military and takes in the runaway creature in her very sexy disguise a bit of nudity and partial nudity a pointless sex scene all feature along the film stumbles through a few obvious set-pieces and running jokes about being shown photographs i quite liked the star trek jokes when micheal dorn had been taken over and he got a really cool death was fairly obvious that stacey keach was going to be taken over and the film had quite a weak ending it would have been nice to show exactly what kind of talent the alien passed to eggert
this is the biggest pile of crap i have ever watched do not rent the makers of this movie should be band from ever making another movie it starts with some what of a plot then fades fast to nothing i think i would rather watch paint dry then to as much as looking at the cover the actors were awful the plot faded fast filming left to much work to be done not one good thing to say about this crap movie if you rent this movie you will waste your money i really enjoy national lampoon movies but this was a waste of time learn to write learn to act learn to produce and learn to direct i feel i should sue these a-holes that made this movie for money wasted on rental cost and time lost
almost golden the jessica savitch ratio format soap-opera dramatisation of the rise and fall of first female tv news anchor with a tighter script and direction and a better cast this might have passed muster but the flimsy story really wasn't worth the effort a good documentary on the subject might have been the best way to go typically strong production values in the tv movie conveyor-belt manner but all as superficial as old fluff and just as engaging
i've written at least a half dozen scathing reviews of this abysmal little flick and none get published so i must opine that someone at really likes this awful movie the idea that a bunch of oilmen can resurrect a military tank that has set in the desert for over a decade and make a fighting machine of it again is ludicrous so is the acting and direction pass on it
i think i will make a movie next weekend oh wait i'm i'm sure i can fit it in it looks like whoever made this film fit it in i hope the makers of this crap have day jobs because this film sucked it looks like someones home movie and i don't think more than was spent making it total crap who this stuff be released
waste of my life the director should be embarrassed why people feel they need to make worthless movies will never make sense to me when she died at the end it made me laugh i had to change the channel many times throughout the film because i was getting embarrassed watching such poor acting hopefully the guy who played heath never gets work again on top of that i hope the director never gets to make another film and has his paycheck taken back for this crap out of
just the fact that the cover is a drawing like those old b-movies should give you a warning about the quality of this movie this is however not a b-movie it is a d-movie are no known actors and the animals wow it is the worst data-animation ever made during the last two decades hardly ever see the scaaary sabretooth shown on the front cover you just hear people scream bleed and die and you occasionally see a teeth or a tiger-paw so amateur maybee worth seeing just because so bad give it to a friend and say this is the best movie i have ever seen and wait for their reaction he he movie is to weak to give it a spoiler alert this is a spoiler
the script is the casting is absolutely style the costumes do not look like some from the high highbury society comparing gwyneth paltrow with kate beckinsale i can only say that ms beckinsale speaks british english better than ms paltrow though in ms acting lies the very nature of emma woodhouse mr northam undoubtedly is the best mr knightley of all versions he is romantic and not at all sharp-looking and unfeeling like mr knightley in the tv-version spectator cannot see at all mr elton-ms smith development as it was in the motion version so one cannot understand where was all trying of make a elton-smith match of the portrait
this movie has a very broadway feel the backdrop the acting the and yet all it has some sense of a broadway without the bang movie is slow-paced the picture disjointed the singing pops up on you so that you suddenly are reminded a musical sinatra the pitch and the accent of her voice was unnecessary mr i remember the numbers on my dice understated singing how much jean simmons looks like vivien leigh in her havana scenes the bone structure how i would've killed to have seen miss leigh in a role challenging brando again
yet another example of the complete waste of uk lottery money just how commercial did this film prove the film council who funded this miserable garbage should be stranded on one of the london undergrounds disused stations for allowing this clich√©d dismal specimen to be committed to film a half mutant thing made up of all the horror movies the director has seen and felt fit to imitate most notably deathline amongst its many sins is the quite obvious failure to make the lead character remotely sympathetic until the last minute a little bit too late then surely all those development executives at the uk film council could have noticed this at the script stage add to this the terrible acting and the laughable appearance of the creature and you get a prime example of how not to scare
i am not sure who is writing reviews for this movie but trust me it stkinks i have seen hundreds of horror films and slasher flicks and this one is lame it is only about long and believe me that is all i could take plot is terrible acting is even worse and there is no development at the david cocteau films are better than this run away from jigsaw i expected to hate the acting which can be forgiven in direct to video movies if the plot is had no scares very little a truly unattractive watched this with three other i hope are still talking to wanted me to fling the disc out the window i can not believe anyone could this tripe a good review
this film is described as a the first minutes and james presence point to it being a humorous gangster the introduction of the ridiculous female lead begins a number of ludicrous plot twists which do little to conceal the contrived ending the film moves between used loosely and surreal drama with some out of context adult scenes thrown in the lead female angel of the title is poorly acted and the actress is not helped by the script which requires some unbelievable extremes of character to be portrayed james belushi is the only one who handles his part well but is also let down by the poor script one to avoid
i picked this movie on the cover alone thinking that i was in for an adventure to the level of indiana jones and the temple of doom unfortunately i was in for a virtual yawn not like any yawn i have had before though this yawn was so large that i could barely find anything of quality in this movie the cover described amazing special effects there were none the movie was so lightweight that even the stereotypes were awfully portrayed it does give the idea that you can solve problems with violence good if you want to teach your kids that i don't keep away from this one if you are looking for family entertainment then you might find something that is more inspiring elsewhere
even if you could get past the idea that these boring characters personally witnessed every significant moment of the so katie didn't join the manson family and nobody died at altamont this movie was still unbelievably awful i got the impression that the writers just locked themselves in a room and watched forrest gump the wonder years and oliver films over and over again and called it research a canadian television critic called the conclusion of the first episode head spinning he was right
this movie should have never been a shame of the hire convincing actors and make a proper movie very thin plot and unconvincing lines almost hilarious and that is a shame for an action movie not worth keep replaying the same shots of an stealth airplane flying away you have seen it ones and that was not worth re-running or is time for steven seagal to retire from movies are getting worser every dawn and submerged were already bad but this movie is even worse
i just saw dick tracy and i thought it was terrible the paintings in the background of the cities looked awful also the mob characters looked too weird warren beatty didn't do an awful job as dick tracy but it was definetely not one of his better performances madonna should just stick to singing glenne headly did a good job in this movie i gave this movie a just because of the amazing acting by al pacino it wasn't a high note in his career but he still did a good job
i had high hopes for this movie the theater monologue is great and nic balthazar is a very interesting man with a lot of experience and knowledge when it comes to movies am a fan of a lot of belgian movies but this movie is bad completely unbelievable that actors who are are suddenly playing the roles of teenagers the linguistic games were hideous and over the top nothing about the film seemed real to me the ending was way too deus ex machina for am very disappointed and think i wasted an hour and a half of my life
the idea behind this film was a good one too bad it wasn't written well casting sidney poitier as the fbi agent was a good idea and he did an outstanding job tom berenger on the other hand only knows one emotion in most of his movies anger kirstie character could have been a great one and even showed some possibilities once but the writer really let us down by making her role mostly a helpless female this was completely inconsistent with the strongly independent character she was supposed to be i don't care for acting anyway the movie should have ended about fifteen minutes sooner than it did the director milked the cow dry before the unbelievable final action i will keep this in my collection only as an example of performances
i watched this movie to the end and that was really not easy it is so boring bad played and in nearly every detail stolen from blair witch project that you can't believe the makers take this serious even harder to believe is how this product made it onto vhs and if want to see a horror-movie just watch scream but if you want to laugh out loud and have a good time watching some kids running through the woods screaming at each other and showing of their inability watch dark area
after watching this i had lost a little respect for christopher lee has passed over time this film was utter garbage first they tried to recreate the ending from the first howling with incredibly bad make-up then they try to turn it into a sad excuse of a werewolf porn film the plot sucks and the whole film is just awful a brother of a werewolf victim from the first film the look of it it was supposed to be dee wallace up with lee and another woman to destroy the group of werewolves lead by sybil danning who seems to be naked all the is not even worth renting you want to waste your time and money watching the nudity try to catch it on cable instead it would be so chopped up it may actually make sense
it is not often i watch a film that is as dreadful as this one i continued to watch every minute hoping that this was intended as a joke only to find it was meant to be taken seriously well as seriously as this genre acting was disgraceful and the situations horribly contrived and clich√©d if a film was made in example and had the quality of hide seek in its direction we would think that cinema back then was naive as it happens this film was made in and i have yet to see a film from the silent era that has as little charm as this not for the serious worth a rating
my favorite quote from crow was when the car was going off the cliff the movie is so bad even the car wants to get out of had to be the funniest movie i have ever seen it was seriously out there to scare you which makes it even funnier if it weren't for mystery science theater i wouldn't be here today
i chose dead creatures because i thought it was a zombies movie just like days or so but not at all it isn't even a horror movie nothing happens except for a group of women that seem to have been infected by a strange virus that make her to eat human flesh in order to survive plot gives rise to a series of disgusting scenes of very bad rate
well i don't know where to begin obviously this was a made for tv movie so my expectations were low i was pleasantly surprised by the overall direction of the second hour but anything before or after that seemed to be a paint by the numbers sort of talk about bad chemistry between the tow lovebird detectives would go more in depth but this movie doesn't really deserve it grade rating
the performances of fishbourne appears strangely funny somehow and harris are remarkable unlike who doesn't appear to find sense in his role and ends up in the motorial behaviour of a old man in fact the screenplay doesn't make sense imagine a min happy ending-plot plus a sudden turn appendix without any argumental structure in respect to the characters more an accident than a screenplay and may be good for examination purposes at screen-wrights schools the more you remind the details the stronger this impression gets the capital punishment is not an issue here although it is a subject from the beginning it sort of fades away without further comment the subject-matter and environment could have been good
i rented this movie because i hoped it would be one the whole family would enjoy although the movie is family friendly my family did not enjoy it because it gives a false view of god if you obey god and follow him you are not guaranteed success your football team won't always win you won't magically get better grades infertility isn't always cured you won't always get a raise sometimes you'll be stuck with the old does not exist to meet our every whim rather we were created to glorify him sometimes we glorify him most when things seem to be going bad for us to live is christ to die is gain
after reading the other reviews for this film i am of the opinion that the high markers are probably paid studio lackeys as the film i saw was absolutely dire with wooden acting lacklustre scripting and plodding predictable directing one of the few plus points has to be the stunning scenery as this film features some stunning backdrops with great sweeping vistas and dramatic skies and wide open prairies sadly when the most memorable thing in a film is the part featured behind the actors this has to be a warning sign as to the quality of the movie all in all a thoroughly uninspiring addition to the western genre which even at the very reasonable price it can be obtained on dvd is best to avoid
over several years of looking for half-decent films to rent for my kids i've developed a sixth-sense for spotting the really cheesy direct-to-video efforts that are really painful to sit through anyone over the age of eight i dropped the ball on this one and the kids spent half the movie asking me what did she say that for and why did he do that and my eyes got sore from rolling them every minute or so as characters did a really bad job of introducing seemingly random plot changes and the next time someone decides that having absolutely no skill with a sword is simply bringing realism to a film please run them through with a dull butter knife prehysteria was head and shoulders above this arrgh
if they gave me the option of negative numbers i'd use it this movie was truly god-awful i went into the theaters expecting it to be horrible and it somehow managed to exceed my script was weak the acting was painful i wanted to walk out but my friend was driving and wanted to get her moneys worth i think we were both growing of the breasts when the girls got their super power and changing of the hair color was just wrong eddie izzard just seemed wrong for the part of super villain he came off as oddly weak and silly jenny johnsons thurman came off as psychotic and strange as did wilson friend vaughn wilson
after the debacle of the first sleepaway camp who thought that a franchise could be born sc ii is superior in aspect more inspired killings and just whole lot more fun while that might not be saying much to the first movie sleepaway camp ii is worth the entertaining doesn't take itself too seriously like sc i inspired killings cons crappy acting and mullets line
this movie is the biggest steaming pile of you know what being from and growing up in wichita know for a fact of the movie was bogus aside from the names of some of the victims nothing else much was correct the movie looks like it was made with handy-cam it had footage that i believe came from another film along with stock footage from a slaughter house i usually enjoy watching bad films for the fun of it but due to the bad acting poorly prepared or non existent sets and a very dull and short was a struggle to watch it through to the ending i recommend that you not waste your money on this film or you will be sorry crunch
hood of the living dead and all of the other movies these guys directed look like they got together and filmed this with their buddies who have zero talent one afternoon when they were bored are completely unrehearsed and unconvincing i find that of amateur movies and of home video footage is better than this film the similarities between them warrant the comparison hey lets see if anyone is dumb enough to buy our movies hopefully nobody else wasn't my apologies to those involved in the flic as this review is somewhat harsh but i was the dope who read your fake reviews and purchased the movie
the acting was bad the script was bad and the ending was just only good comment i could make about this movie would be the special effects and make apart from movie would be one of the worst movies of on earth did they have to remake such a perfect movie and ruin
why would any legitimate actor having read the script participated in this piece of crap my god it is actually embarrassing to even watch it i can't imagine the shame these people must feel for being a part of it also there is apparently some controversy as to whether river phoenix had a cameo in the movie he was uncredited but his list of roles here does give him credit btw rain is his sister for those who have were asking before this film is proof that no matter how many big names you have ears don't make silk purses i love lorraine bracco but this was just sad sad sad maybe somebody someday can explain to me the reason for this kind of film it has no endearing entertaining or even comedic properties in comparison to bad everything else
i watched this movie because i like nicolas cage and well i found it strange and completely pointless so i decided to poke around a little bit and got my hands on the copy of it wow what a difference the original one was way better i'd like you all to know it did originally actually make a statement existence did have a purpose it was really the christian public expressing their fear of paganism if you dig deeper into it it also makes comments on life but i don't want to go into details just simply put if you were disappointed and you'd like to know what it should look like feel free to watch the version a little dated but a lot better
the saddest part of this is the fact that these are minutes i'll never get back i knew this was terrible from the get-go with the guy dressed as a lunatic indian chief on top of the roof if they could get away with that in my boy is really into baseball right now so we decided to rent it on a rainy day even though he seemed to enjoy parts of it i had to cringe when i heard all the needless foul language bad bad movie this was an awful ripoff of bad news bears completely shameless and completely predictable i don't mind a predictable movie if done well but this one absolutely was not
i saw the movie last night here at home but i thought it was too long first of all second the things i saw in the movie were way too out of text to even have in this what i thought was going to be a comedy type movie like the rest before the things isn't funny in the movie fianc√© hitting his girlfriend beatings the movie was way too about wanting to go to sleep and wondering when it will end when you wake up and still have it playing some of the things at the reunion were too much to the lady felt like i was almost watching a spiritual song show here come on perry you can do better then this
another british cinema flag waver real garbage on offer here once again i cannot understand i am british why this over the top patriotic nonsense was ever made eight years mark you from when the second world war had actually ended other here have remarked on the editing and apparent seamless use of archive footage this is extremely poorly observed the archive footage is in abundance model aircraft swing from wires in the action scenes like so many kites in the wind the usual map room sequences tattoo the movie to make us supposedly drawn into the whole malta event guinness must have his worst acting performance ever the shocking back drop dog fight scenes are laughable hawkins bores us all to death in the map room area ealing made many great movies this clearly is not one of them they should have stayed away from such unconvincing rot
god what an awful thing oliver stone probably wanted to experiment or something the terrible use of music and pictures here but what for really the whole thing behind natural born killers seems to be a clever look at how medias can turn into complete trash but unfortunately the movie turns into trash itself please mr stone next time you want to criticize the fascism of tv shows using violence to get high rates avoid doing the same with your movie michael haneke said quite cleverly about this film that it was denouncing media fascism with fascist cinematographic ways how true only he forgot to tell us about the massive headache you get after sitting through this overlong load of crap
this is not the worst film i have seen of peter greenaway but it is close that dishonor goes to the even worse pillow book this films of i have seen i find them all to be miserable like the positive cinematic flourishes he displays are totally unredeemed by the repugnancy of his material and overall presentation
this movie could have been so much better especially considering the talent larenz portrayal of frankie lymon was not good especially in musical performances he doesn't lip sync well and his stage mannerisms are larenz tate when he should have been frankie lymon the portrayal of the women as a bunch of gold diggers has hollywood written all over it the powers that be obviously pushed it but it only made the characters more unrealistic the positives of the movie were miguel portrayal of little richard and the cameo of little richard himself lela rochon is eye candy as usual even in a conservative role too bad that the talents of halle berry and vivica a fox were wasted the whole frankie lymon saga was fascinating in real life too bad this film was a wasted opportunity
dil was a memorable movie that bring to the celluloid a great director like indra kumar the movie followed with beta ishq raja masti all of whom were then every successful director gives a few horrible movies alongwith some hits too pyare mohan is one such the comedies are told nicely but then they fail the viewer to laugh comparing with the kind of comedy movies being made today this is a you really want to watch a movie and laugh please don't watch this because the pathetic comedy will make you cry short the movie is worth a miss
story of a man who has unnatural feelings for a pig starts out with a opening scene that is a terrific example of absurd comedy a formal orchestra audience is turned into an insane violent mob by the crazy chantings of singers unfortunately it stays absurd the whole time with no general narrative eventually making it just too off putting even those from the era should be turned off the cryptic dialogue would make shakespeare seem easy to a third grader on a technical level better than you might think with some good cinematography by future great vilmos zsigmond future stars sally kirkland and frederic forrest can be seen briefly
at first the movie seemed to be doing great they had the characters profiles plot seemed to be going in the right direction however as the movie progressed it seemed the director focused on the wrong kind of just a lot was edited from the movie the characters identities changed for the worse within the movie also there seemed to be a lot of implicit meaning in other words they had things within the movie that didn't seem to fit the movie itself and the title no where in the movie does the title fit the suppose the title works for the previews actors did well with what they they had a better director and writer maybe this would have worked out better but it didn't so now a new terrible movie coming out this friday my waste your time or money
for such a great classic tale the setting grendel was disappointing as a writer i blame the script which completely lacked dramatic tension the rubric of the club story is useful and would have provided a new take on the literary classic for some weird reason that rubric was dropped early on to know this was shot in days says to me rushed and it unfortunately shows now we'll have to wait for the hollywood version on the big screen i word on fx i can tolerate really crappy cgi but the script has to rock and this one was just too slow spartan and lacking in drama i'd blame it on the actors but since i know writing more than acting i'll pick on my colleague
the movie was a huge disappointment especially since it was directed by priyadarshan it was sad to see such dismal standards poor non existent and song sequences with bad songs every minute and at the most odd times killed whatever humor the movie could offer some of the scenes were funny but it amounted to probably only mins of the whole duration the editing was pathetic dismal overall the movie disappointed as the lack of story was only too evident in fact only a few people stayed to watch the second half of the movie after the wouldn't miss anything at all if you don't watch the movie not worth spending valuable ticket money on this movie wait till it appears on tv
i guess its possible that i've seen worse movies but this one is a real stinker the plot is unremarkable but thats not the worst of it the directing is no where close to what you would expect from andy ching capable of good work but failed to pull this movie harmon playing the female lead as a reporter dogging into behind the assassination of the president truly butchered the role there was no chemistry with gooding her demeanor was flat and wooden and the inch spike heels she wore throughout the movie were absurd this outing for harmon places her solidly at the bottom of the b what was cuba gooding thinking he has to his credit a number of outstanding performances but this was far beneath what we've come to expect from james woods and burt reynolds poor poor poor poor poor
if it wasn't for some immature gullible idiot i know insisting that i watch this documentary i would never have seen this comedy this film is full of bad scripting and laughable moments one in particular is where the afghan police soldiers arrest don larson for filming in the streets while they allow the cameraman to carry on filming his arrest and then drive away still filming presumably to his plush hotel then the scene where a car crashes into another car which has been turned upside down and parked nicely on the side of the road without any evidence of it being in a crash or am surprised this has currently got the rating it has i thought imdb users had more sense
they are among us is poor science fiction at best mediocre acting bogs down this film the plot holes are numerous aliens that somehow came to earth on a meteor and have been hiding among us for over years but need a plastic surgeon to make them appear human in their alien form they supposedly have exo-skeletons is why they need the plastic surgery but when you see them they have teeth and fingernails the father disappeared after project blue book closed but was supposedly an pilot and on and on if you want to see an alien invasion movie pick invasion of the body snatchers and see how it is done right
i would have liked to give this movie a zero but that wasn't an option this movie sucks the women cannot act i should have known it was gonna suck when i saw bobby brown nobody in my house could believe i hadn't changed the channel after the first minutes the idea of black females as gunslingers in the western days is ridiculous not just a race thing also a gender the combination of the two things is am sorry because some of the people in the movie aren't bad but the movie itself was awful it was not credible as a movie it might be entertaining to a certain group of people but i am not in that group lol and using a great line from a great great all i have to say about that
a waist to indulge such great actors in such a weak and boring movie besides all the unanswered questions posted in the other comments so difficult about capturing the robbers just eliminate the bank workers see who was at the bank-from all the cameras footage angles-prior to the robbers entry and you have those extra remaining robbers among the hostages where is the suspense every body is talking about it was so obvious the moment the hostages were asked to change into this identical uniform that they were all going to walk out the front door seen it many times at least mr spike lee could have seasoned the movie with some good music score and artistic shooting the movie is not worth it pronto
unusual setting for an american wartime movie new subject matter four sisters and their relationships with american soldiers from one bearing the illegitimate child of the dead son of a senator to another living with seven marines at a time before being murdered by her returning pow new zealander to see paul newman deliver such a poor performance so soon after his unforgettable role as rocky graziano in the brilliant somebody up there loves for two fine stars joan fontaine and jean simmons to leave so little of themselves on a that i could be bothered to write a review of such a poor film give it a miss
this movie was so bad outdated and stupid that i had rough times to watch it to the end i had seen this rodney guy in natural born killers and i thought he was funny as hell in it but this movie was crap the jokes weren't funny actors weren't funny anything about it wasn't even remotely funny don't waste your time for this only positive things about this were the beautiful wives and molly shannon who i'm sure tried her best but the script was just too awful why i rated it instead of but definitely one of the worst films i've ever seen
you know how everyone jokes about the acting in porno movies well if you've always found the plot line of a porn to captivate your interest then this movie is for you it truly was like a porn without the sex or if that analogy is not to your liking imagine you and your drunk roommate found a movie camera abandoned on a park bench this is the movie that you would make acting camera work done on a casio keyboard this movie has it all and more for those who are masochists in the crowd this is a premiere piece for your collection i can figure is that the only people to submit reviews for this dripping pile of movie were people who starred in it movie career is over before it started
an art house dream overrated overpraised overdone a pretentious melange that not only did not deserve best picture of on its own merits it was dwarfed by the competition from the start place in the sun detective story streetcar named desire abbott and costello meet the invisible man you name it if it came out in better than this arthouse crapola the closing ballet is claptrap for the intellectual crowd out of place and in the wrong movie few actors in their time were less capable acting or less charismatic than kelly and caron my worst of saw movies and among the worst best picture oscar winners
i went to see this one with much expectation quite unfortunately the dialogue is utterly stupid and overall the movie is far from inspiring awe or interest even a child can see the missing logic to behaviors kids need creative stories which would inspire them which would make them daydream about the events precisely what happened with movies like and star wars a decade ago many kids imagined about becoming jedi knights and igniting their own lightsabers seriously don't waste your time money on this one
diary of sex addict is a pathetic attempt at a serious drama about sexual compulsiveness probably a movie marketing scam this flick is a stylish shoot with a good cast and little else going for it bottom line diary would have us believe that our sex addict character has the dumbest wife in the world a stable of babes on the side who have nothing better to do than drop their panties for him at his whim and no job in spite of being a restaurateur at the best this flick could have been good drama at the worst cheap softcore diary isn't either and nowhere in between this for the dumpster
christopher lambert is annoying and disappointing in his portrayal as gideon this movie could have been a classic had lambert performed as well as tom hanks in forrest gump or dustin hoffman as raymond babbitt in rain man or sean penn as sam dawson in i am bad because the story line is meaningful to us in life the supporting performances by charlton heston carroll o'connor shirley jones mike connors and shelley winters were excelent of
baba rajinikanth will never forget this name in his life this is the movie which caused his downfall it was released with much hype but crashed badly and laid to severe financial losses for its producers and distributors rajinikanth had to personally repay them for the losses incurred soon after its release he tried venturing into politics but failed miserably its a very bad movie with horrible acting bad-quality makeup and pathetic screenplay throughout the movie rajinikanth looks like a person suffering from some disease i'm one of the unfortunate souls who saw baba first day first show in theatre the audiences were so bored that most of them left the theatre before the intermission sorry i'll not recommend this one to anyone
plot an amorous couple decide to engage in some extra-marital hijinks in a flashy car they then become stuck in a compromising position while said car wanders aimlessly about the countryside until the hapless couple are rescued by the it the entire movie there may have been some dialogue here and there but nothing comes to mind it should be obvious by now that this movie is not just pointless but actually physically painful to watch the fact that it starred two of the uks best up-and-coming actors of whom is now sadly deceased only adds to the charleson was outstanding in the very much deserved oscar-winning chariots of fire remember him for that role and try hard to pretend that this particular celluloidal abomination never happened
i have seen many good korean movies including thrillers and movies with darker overtone but this one sucks the director seems to be a sadist who happened to get someone to produce some junk the movie lacks any sort of entertainment value and is not even a thriller i can't believe someone really made such a movie even though acting is ok the story line and the feeling it leaves is am sure i am not going to see any movies of this director no sense of movie making and utter disappointment in having thriller moments all this has is showing scenes with psychopath wasting the reels with badly shot scenes and showing more blood and violence thinking that makes it thrilling very disappointing movie and i strongly recommend skipping all the movies of this sort
this one of the best reality shows a ever saw we can see the concerts we can see the life of britney i love the five episodes i was always being surprised by britney and the subjects of the show i think that some people don't watch the show at all we can how a great person she his she his really funny really gentle and she loves her fans and we can see how she loves her work i just don't give a because of k-fed he his a real jerk he doesn't seem to like britney at all i they make a second season of this great show because it shows at some people how britney really is go britney your the best and you will never leave our hearts
the film must have been shot in a are scenes where you can see the camera reflections and its red the green light that blends with the plot and the lines are really awful without even the slightest least as a thriller genre that got to do with poe in the a shallow and childish film is full of clise and no you want to watch a funny b-movie for a relaxing evening with friends then go for it you will enjoy it i did but no way to take this film seriously
the next time you are at a party and someone asks the other day i heard the expression will does anyone know what it means tell them to sit through head above water the only way diaz could possibly have survived this movie was by means of this literary device commonly used by bad writers there are some comic scenes and you will have a few laughs however the film does not stand up to the most minor logical analysis why does keitel tie hand in front of her instead of behind why so she can do the chainsaw gag of course for me the best part of this movie was that i saw it on a cable channel instead of spending four bucks at the video shop
i am very disappointed with the original good quality of doesn't exist any more this is more like a sitcom some of casts from original movie returned and got some of my memory back the captain of dooley now loves to hit him like a scene from old comedy show that was crazy the deal with the change of police it seems like they are now lapd not san diego pd it is a completely different movie from
i'm at this very moment debating whether i should even finish watching this poppycock of a movie they had a pretty interesting idea with the buried movie set and that was it so far this incomprehensible mess has no real story there is the buried set some wolf headed monster running amok an amulet and a bunch of bad actors attacked by the wolf masked whatever it is what i would have missed had i had the good sense to eject this nonsense is a dune buggy chase some really bad some incredibly stupid dialog more bad and the hero fighting paper cut outs other than the original idea this film has absolutely zero redeeming qualities my mistake for continuing to watch merk
ouch they don't come much worse than this horrid adaptation of c s beloved novel while the adaptation is very true to the novel the acting is simply awful and the sets and special effects are on a scale equivalent to a school play i've read that the budget for this miniseries was the grandest that the bbc has ever given at the time but surely they could have scraped together a bit more than the that it looks like this was filmed for the worst effect of all is mr beaver i know computer effects weren't at the level necessary or even cost effective at the time but the costume store man in a suit look was horrid better to have just cut the character from the film than do that to the role avoid this at all costs
just a warning this is the worst movie i have seen in years i couldn't watch it to the end it is a pure waste of time i really feel sorry for snipes that he ended up in such a movie there really is not much to say about it horrible acting incredibly bad lines story everything the only reason i would advise you to watch this movie is if you really want to see how a movie shouldn't be just to tell you one scene the police are searching for snipes and they are surrounding the building with helicopters and cars they are shooting around inside the building but still they are whispering so that snipes doesn't suspect a thing
the title should have been the walker that was only he did was nothing on the movie that was good the description of the movie doesn't really comply with the only thing that i can get from the movie is that he was a good son but a low life terrible sorry that i expend my money and time on this movie i saw people leaving the theater in the middle of the movie i stayed hoping that it will a mistake i got there is a suggestion that i can make to he producer is to re-direct his life to another field because making movies is definitely no his cup of tea
i saw this movie when it was released and my distaste for it has stuck with me all these years why goal seems to be to take every literary image in the tempest and make it literal if a character were to say my heart takes flight we'd be shown an actual human heart with pigeon wings attached flapping across the screen process makes for some lush tableaux but ultimately a facile exercise and it becomes deadly don't begrudge the pleasure other viewers found in this movie but worth knowing that not everyone in the audience was enraptured
this movie could have been minutes long if it weren't for all the bickering between son and father very predictable both male stars need a good slap in the face would you like some cheese with that whine two a headache i can understand why the mother left her hubby after don't know how she lasted that long the first minutes made me want to turn the movie off wishing i had never paid the to watch it the movie didn't flow well and was painfully long i kept watching my watch hoping time would fly didn't the script had so much repetition that it had to be easy for the writer to fill space on a positive scenery was pretty fall being my favorite season the car the ford was also quite nice this movie gets an rating approaching an f
woody allen made september proving that even a genius could screw up this is mel september monumentally stupid boring and unfunny i must confess i did not watch it through to the end the flick ranks among the dishonored few the money pit out to sea spitfire grill which either put me to sleep or forced me to reach for the rewind button and i say this sadly as a devoted mel brooks fan he should stick to straight comedy and leave social commentary alone how the same fellow that made young frankenstein and spaceballs could crank out a dog like this is beyond me to be avoided at all costs
come on get real the knights of christ ordo templi or the knights templar as they are more commonly called did not even exist until the early century the story is so laughable that pathetic dolph lundgren just looked positively bored and besides if you wanted to have a real-life templar why not just use the knights of christ who are still in existence in portugal at least they should have taken history into account the only redeeming quality i could find in this movie was that the artifacts looked authentic enough to pass for medieval or gothic period pieces the acting was bad the storyline appalling the action horrible and the props were okay
bela lugosi plays dr lorenz who loves his wife so much that he will do anything to keep her young this film starts off with a wedding as the bride is about to take her vows she suddenly collapses she is pronounced dead and taken away by undertakers trouble is that these are not real undertakers but body snatchers a wave of bride deaths at the altar and their body disappearing confounds the police enter reporter patricia hunter to solve the case she does track down dr lorenz but he also decides to use her youth to keep his wife young also
a stuttering plot uninteresting characters and sub-par say the least dialogue plagues this tv production that could hardly have been interesting even with a billion dollar production characters aren't believable in their motives actions or their professed occupations the plot reads like a bad dungeons and hack but with plasma rifles and force fields there are severe continuity issues and the degree of pointless interaction between the characters has this author at least wincing it like the plague watch any episode of dark angel and you will have better acting dialogue and plot yuck
i'm glad the folks at imdb were able to decipher what genre this film falls into i had a suspicion it was trying to be a comedy but since it also seems to want to be a dark and solemn melodrama i wasn't sure for a comedy it is amazingly bereft of even the slightest venture into the realms of humour right up until the ridiculous twist ending which confirms what an utter waste of time the whole movie actually is it is hard to describe just how amateurish the hazing really is did anyone involved in this film have any idea at all what they were supposed to be doing actually worth watching so that you can stare at the screen in slack-jawed disbelief at how terrible it is
i saw the capsule comment said great acting in my opinion these are two great actors giving horrible performances and with zero chemistry with one another for a great director in his all-time worst effort robert de niro has to be the most ingenious and insightful illiterate of all time jane performance uncomfortably drifts all over the map as she clearly has no handle on this character mostly because the character is so poorly written molasses-like would be too swift an adjective for this excruciating pacing although the intent is to be an uplifting story of curing illiteracy watching it is a true bummer i give it out of truly one of the worst movies for its budget level that i have ever seen
although in many ways i agree with the other reviewers comments i find that the plot and idea are very good many of the supporting actors were very good the fatal problem with this film is ellen pompeo i am sure i have never seen a less talented actor how this person has ever been in a film or on television i cannot imagine in my opinion she would be better as a greater at a wal-mart to see a person with this low level of talent involved in paying roles does beg the question who does she know i would very much like to see this film re-made with some talent i do not fault the writer for the failure of this film to be worth the time to view it
i'm being generous giving this movie stars the line about have you even seen the wizard of oz was the best part for me with terrible writing and acting like displayed in this movie no wonder so many are taken in by worthless tv reality shows do yourself a favor and get out of the house and hit a royals baseball game your gonna be glad ya did
my life is about saving animals i do volunteer work with a cat rescue organization i am a vegetarian because i couldn't kill an animal even to sustain my life i can't even kill a spider i put it outdoors the scene where the children throw rocks at the bird until it dies with sooner participating in an attempt to be accepted by the other children made me sick and has haunted me ever since it simply convinces me that human beings are pathetic in their need for acceptance the ending the foster parents adopt sooner does not redeem the depiction of animal cruelty why would anyone want their child to see this film
this has to be the worst movie i've ever attempted to watch in the first minutes there wasn't anything to keep my interest in this movie i was on vacation at the time and had plenty of time to devote to a just-for-the-fun-of-it movie the condo we were staying in had this movie in stock they must have got it from the store or you like adam sandler this is nothing like any other movie made this started with a bad premise and then just got worse nothing even remotely funny in watched a lot of movies including some i didn't care for but if you decide to waste your time on this movie don't say i didn't warn you
jesus christ i can't believe i've wasted my time watching this movie i only watched because i have such a crush on jordan ladd but watching this film almost put me off her this is absolutely awful i could have been watching survivor series over lead guy in this was so bland and generic i would love it if the great mistuharu misawa tiger drove his ass through a glass window i was enraging every time he was saying lake and cabin i'd kick his ladd on the other hand was absolutely wonderful a true angel but she couldn't even save this utter joke of a film sadly she couldn't even act like she was off her nut when she took that truth drug it looked also loved the bit where jordan accidentally spilled yogurt on her it reminded me of a time do watch this film because of awfulness
if your idea of entertainment is watching graphic footage of people being run over by cars get to see a woman passing under the front wheel being twisted as the car passes over her before she goes under the back wheel and they show it twice in case you missed it the first time then this is the documentary for you admitedly i didn't watch any more of this very disturbing piece of voyeurism but that was enough for me maybe the rest is even wonder how long going to take for television networks to start showing slush movies perhaps game shows based on self-mutilation might be already know that there are disturbed people in the world and that horrible things happen i don't need to see the proof on the tv masquerading as entertainment
my mother keeps a cassette of this film as a general threat to any film loving person who annoys her everything about it such it is a true gave it were you inadvertently watching a good film and accidentally voted for this involved in the movie making process should be forced to watch at least a small section of this film it should be an indelible stain on the minds on all that hold film sacred and be revered as the tide mark of the cinematically dire
i watched this show and i simply didn't find it funny at all it might have been the first episode lately i realize abc is playing a lot of stupid shows nowadays and is going down as a station all the characters on this show are pretty bad actors but even if they were good the jokes and script are pretty horrible and would still bring the show down i would say that i believe this show will be cancelled but seeing as how abc is doing pretty horrible for quality of shows they are playing they might just keep this one simply because average compared to them
director murnau wisely stuck with the silent film medium he knew so well to cover this story of native islander life in the south seas the documentary style works very well for the first half of the movie the landscapes are beautiful and the daily life activities of the islanders are interesting to watch the film loses momentum though when it begins to concentrate more on the narrative story of two doomed lovers the storyline just never gets that interesting despite being handled well by murnau won an academy award for best cinematography although the award probably should have been for best scenery you can't really credit the dp for getting to shoot in such a beautiful location
its unfortunate that someone decided to spin off on the best horror movies of all time in my book this poor copy steals lots of material from the first three films going as far as even copying how persons die and what will happen in the future to the key characters and it basically tries to cram in three films into one and fails it fails even to create a good scary atmosphere for one with the odd exception where the impressive choral music brings back memories of the old only thing we can be thankful for is that there has not been an omen v
in one respect like the wizard of oz with paris in black-and-white and the riviera in color but supposedly about possessive love destructiveness and moral decadence while actually being about designer gowns shots of the riveria lots of big expensive cars and music-and dancing interludes that suggest vincente minnelli on one of his off-days watchable but a remarkable example of desperate dark plot material and glitzy style heading in opposite directions this the model for the talented mister ripley does anyone sense an affinity between jean seberg and matt damon
this tiresome plodding las vegas casino heist movie in almost impossible to watch and get involved in something you look at if you have absolutely nothing else better to do the only two decent things in this movie are both attached to gorgeous stella stevens and one spends the entire program hoping she'll fall out of one of those skimpy tops she wears many great shots of las vegas it was still a cool place to visit and the fashions of the day are good for a giggle as well otherwise one big yawn the rhino dvd has a very good widescreen transfer but even at under bucks it still ain't worth it in my humble opinion
now for the truth its very very weak storyline for a walt disney film its total rubbish when the robinson appear the films all over the place i was shocked how poor it was it like alice in wonderland gone wrong it feels like they were short on ideas some mashed some crazy rubbish together to try and get away with it and they don't after that i sat there wishing for the end my younger brother lost interest half way through and was confused by the story the characters are weak and after the robinsons appear you don't care about the ending you just want the film to finish its a film to forget and forget quickly if you've got some spare time don't waste it on this
skip mission galactica and watch the original living legend episodes instead the network took parts of living legend and jammed them into one plot with the awful fire in space episode although galactica suffered from network-controlled writing and a lack of time to prepare for a proper production living legend is the best of the tv series fire in space on its own is one of the worst episodes as a historical note watch galactica the original star trek and then the revival trek series and you'll see the difference in quality between network-produced sci-fi and syndicated sci-fi
i never quite understood the popularity of power rangers show which was quite simply a second rate americanized version of ultra popular super sentai series of the past three decades what was cool about the japanese version gets completely lost in the american version characterization special effects course many kids will say that power rangers are the greatest but they would be sure if they spoke japanese they would learn how much better super sentai is over the american rangers is completely awful try super sentai instead looking for a better show try voltron the third dimension instead
this is arguably the worst film i have ever seen and i have quite an appetite for awful good movies it could have managed a kind of adolescent humour if it had been consistently tongue-in-cheek la rocky horror picture show which was really very funny other movies like plan nine from outer space manage to be funny while trying to be serious as to the acting it looks like they rounded up brain-dead teenagers and asked them to ad-lib the whole production compared to them tom cruise looks like alec guinness there was one decent interpretation that of the older ghoul-busting broad on the motorcycle
this show stinks for parents they usually want their kids to watch something good for them it is usually educational funny and it educational no the doodlebops sing and it they usually sing about themselves they don't try teaching it funny no the doodlebops instead say something which is not intended as a joke and laugh at it bright so bright painful as far as everything is extremely bright so good but nothing is ever wrong in the world of the therefore they are always happy a kid in trouble will become depressed because they have never been exposed to being show is also extremely cheesy every syllable is said to the highest level of exaggeration and very corny kids entertaining but past the age of you won't want your kids to see it they'll never know how to grow up
i fail to see the appeal of this series is supposed to be sci-fi really just see what soap operatically happens this week and oh the cylons are involved through cylon babe that keeps nailing the other guy is pretty lame pretty obvious that was added to the show every time she pops up i'm bewildered as to wtf is supposed to be going on and don't even try to me about story a soap opera with some cgi thrown-in this is not science fiction aside from the original series is not everything worked-up to be if you like trendy edgy dodgy jumpy vague editor-on-crack camera work this show might be for you since nerds seem to be raving about this show a clear indication that vocal nerds opinions have been changed from tng
possible spoilers film is more boring then anything else there seems to be some attempt to build tension through badly lit shots of empty rooms and empty lawns but none of it did a fairly good job with it but on its own the movie is mostly the fake skull rolls out of a pile of ashes the wife becomes hysterical and woozy while the husband is trying to drive the wife crazy says in a deadpan voice there is no skull there no the real ghost-skulls have the husband caught in a pickle as if trapped between first and second base
not like that big mechanical toy says a character early on commenting on jaws well blood surf would only wish to have a beast as convincing as the shark of the jaws series in other words the digital special effects of this movie are terrible acting and directing are not much better either they seem more suited to a deodorant or a bubble-gum commercial than to a horror movie the attitude of the people who worked on this film shows contempt not only for the genre but for the audience too saying you liked this film only encourages filmmakers to offer us more of this crap further destroying the poor horror genre
not the best of the films to be watched nowadays i read a lot of reviews about shining and was expecting it to be very good but this movie disappointed me the sound and environment was good but there was no story here not was there a single moment of fright i expected it to a horror thriller movie but there was no horror no thriller the only scene where i got scared was during the chapter change scene showing wednesday there are lots of fragments i the movie most of the things are left unexplained with nothing to link it to anything the story does not tell us about the women or other scenes that is shown might be a good movie to watch in the but not for the century
bored londoners henry kendall and joan barry fred and emily hill receive an advance on an inheritance they use the money go traveling their lives become more exciting as they begin relationships with exotic betty amann mr kendall and lonely percy marmont ms barry but they remain as boring as they were before arguably bored director alfred hitchcock tries to liven up the well-titled quoted in the film from the tempest rich and strange by ordering up some camera trickery an opening homage to king the crowd is the highlight the low point may be the couple dining on chinese prepared rich and strange alfred hitchcock henry kendall joan barry percy marmont elsie randolph
normally i have no problem with a movie or story with an ending that leaves you wondering to puzzle out what really happened when done on this movie really feels like they got all but the last minutes done then realized they had left to finish saw it on tbs i recommend you not spend money on it either if you catch it on tv watch all but the last minutes then walk away and make your own ending in your the movie would have been better if they had simply got away and come back with the state poice of feds only to find that the town and the car graveyard was gone and by all appearances had never been i had more thumbs so i could give that movie thumbs down
well i don't know what people saw in this movie i don't know saw this movie yesterday and i got a severe headache other than few good dialog there is nothing in this big b rt now is preaching to fall in love with girls of half of you age didn't like the movie at all i wanted to give rating but giving as like the role of the small girl who is called sexy by ab my word dont your self donot watch this time and money
if you are one of the people who finds according to jim great television comedy this is going to rock your world and might i add kudos for proving that good talent good writing and a charismatic star are all you really need on any network other than abc which prefers to air crap like jim show year after is a big steaming brown german shepherd-sized thank you for all of the geniuses who loved the first movie exactly what fans of that film and the lesser belushi deserve comedic chops and choice in projects are never far behind his ability to butcher a blues standard look for him to try to showcase all of his diverse lacks of talent into every project he hurls at the public like a surly zoo you enjoy work this movie is your reward
we all know that countless duds have graced the slasher genre and often deserve nothing but our deepest disgust maybe a bit hastey but damn if slaughter high wasn't terribly unoriginal even for a slasher flick pretty much the plot involves a kid who experienced a carrie-like shower humiliation in high school and returns to the dilapidated building to seek out revenge on a group of former-bullies who all show up to reminisce as you'd expect they are killed off steadily by a masked madman on april by means of electrocution burning hanging and chemically altered beer i've got a number of problems with the plot details and settings of this movie but considering the ending i feel the need to discard my complaints and just say that this is a complete waste of time ignore any thought of viewing this movie
holy freaking god all-freaking-mighty this movie was so bad i thought i was on drugs in a bad way the character acting is the poorest thing i've seen in quite some time this movie was more akin to lord of the g-strings a real movie most of the movie appeared to be done on a horrible green screen my favorite part was when they are in the carriage and you can tell no horse they're fleeing from alien monsters and going about the same speed as a swift jog then it switches to a far-shot with a ridiculous cg horse and the cg in general seems to be sub-par to beyond the eye i mean come on really it felt like a horrible episode of hercules only without kevin sorbo there to save the day worst movie ever
my wife and i are semi amused by howie show i also like shatner even when at his most this is absolutely the worst show on cancel this show it sucks only positive thing i can say is that the girls are hotter on this show and seem to wear less clothing than deal or no questions are a mixture of way too easy and incredibly obscure and watching shatner or the contestant say show me the money makes me want to one will not last
movie sucked a have been reading some of the other reviews apparently there are a lot of people that think that anything woody allen writes or stars in is automatically have watched several of his films in the vain hope that i'm missing something but no they just suck poorly written trash the characters are all very stereotypical to mention rather stupid the plot think it is supposed to be mysterious not sure on that mr character allen on any other film you have seen of you are a fan of woody allen go see this film if you are under don't bother you are a fan of woody allen and you are under you are atypical i don't know what to say
slow incomprehensible boring three enthusiastic words that describe the movie of the book this is surely a case where the movie should never have been made at the expense of the book the best part of the movie was the scenery excellent the worst part was the slow moving interactions of the actors which combined with endless meaningful glances the editing is abrupt and patchy however despite this the actors worked very hard at least trying to be a little believable with a terrible script it was startling that although set in peru there was hardly a person of peruvian descent wandering about the set even in the flashback scenes depicting peru in the century if you have any sense of history try to avoid this movie
what is it is a mish-mash of bizarre recurring motifs shirley temple swastikas and overtly racist music among others unfettered by any sort of narrative or plot or character development the whole thing struck me as self-consciously freak show and i don't mean only the unusual casting decisions it has the feel of a bad acid trip far beyond any level of drug use one might attribute to hunter s thompson or william s burroughs the only movie to which i can compare it is eraserhead second-least-favorite film of all time which was by intent much more depressing but i still found what is it a total waste of my time one thing to give me a peek into the inner workings of someone mind even someone chemically altered consciousness but quite another to just throw weird visuals at me purely for the sake of weirdness
i saw this movie at a sneak preview and i must honestly confess that i do not like films with meryl streep that much this picture was the worst half the theatre did not return after the break halfway the film i couldnt blame them if this wasn't a true story there had been absolutely no need for the second half of the picture just before the film goes forward in time about ten years i myself was expecting the credits to appear
first of all this movie is not a comedy unless you really force yourself you can hardly laugh secondly the movie is slow and boring the acting is not bad but not special there is a lucky luke comic about two families with big noses and one with big ears fighting each other in a small town you will laugh much more if you read this instead of wasting your time with this movie religions and dogmas are not the best source to make a good comedy and this movie does nothing more than confirm this rule there is a similar subject comedy the home teachers this had some good moments my final comment is do not waste your time and money to watch this uninspired and boring film
this film was the most longest film and the record breaking film for sure it had actors after jaani i guess no one had the guts to do something like film as the title suggests is based on the kargil war but the problem is there are too many characters and the romantic subplots and the songs of many characters are there are too many cinematic liberties like killing people with knifes wonder which soldier does by jp dutta pales front of border music is the huge cast ajay devgan stands tall saif is very good in his part and also his first film with kareena abhishek is likable manoj bajpai has his moments sanju is wasted suneil is okay akshaye khanna does his part well rest are passable rani is good esha is okay rest are passable
sadly i don't remember the book anymore but i do recall that i was captivated by the stories of edgar wallace this film represents a typical german production of low quality it does not hold my attention although the story itself is good it is just badly adabted at the center of the misery are the characters that are overly simplyfied and exaggerated they have no nuances in their performances even the well known and liked german actors joachim fuchsberger and eddy aren't cannot rescue this poor spectacle however hope i've been told that the films following this one are getting better and better so in conclusion i must say that this film doesn't deserve the cinematic screen but may be enough for a lazy afternoon
this film proves that the commercial cinema or hollywood movies are in a serious is absolutely no reason that this movie should have been produced apart from the fact that somebody expected success based on is no worth referring to the plot it is a bit more perplexed than a screen is somewhat is a bad actor but francis capra is even
little mosque is one of the most boring cbc comedies i have ever seen they have a way of producing the easiest comedy programming they can for the oldest most-easily-offended viewers which for cbc means year old farmers in saskatchewan the jokes are all predictable and so deathly lame i can't believe it the performances are very hammy and over acted but i don't blame the actors since those kind of one dimensional stereotyped characters are probably exactly what the cbc asked for and demanded very lame show with bad jokes they tried to present as controversial well it is less controversial than the other boring cbc comedies like the hour has minutes royal canadian air farce and rick report
everything in this film is bad the story the acting the effects but its funny funny funny scott valentine with the army uniform thats ten sizes too big is so bad with the permanent attempt at a scowl on his face as the leader of a special ops group its hilarious the terrorists are as scary and realistic as the raptors this is so phoney and bad at everything it tries you have to laugh the part where the giant t-rex who somehow snuck on board a ship and then somehow got below is blown up and you see the metal pole sticking up where its head was is the perfect ending if your into bad films this is the pot of gold the mona lisa of b-b-bad
this is not an all-around terrible comedy but it is very dull it has barely any laughs and it wastes its lavish production values there is one poignant moment near the end when fu manchu offers a dose of his elixir to his nemesis and tells him that you've been my one worthy adversary and now we can start all over again that scene however along with burt amusing cameo in the beginning are the only memorable parts of the movie
this game was made by sega being made by sega i didn't expect much but i also didn't expect this junk either for starters the camera angles work against you in this game the motorcycle is your means of getting around the motorcycle is the worst part in the game whenever you run in to something you just stick there and you don't move you never fall off the bike or wreck for that matter the main character hardly talks even though got a voice that suits him the graphics are horrible you ride through trees on your bike the camera makes fighting the enemy impossible this game wouldn't even be worth renting
this movie is not in anyway funny it tries to be funny with lame humor which is so dry and boring that the movie is just hours of torture throughout the whole movie i was thinking one thing when is this gonna end one thing you have to hand to them is that they do have a very few mildly funny moments which is also why i gave it a whole stars it is unoriginal and uses up almost every old blonde joke in the book even the ones that wasn't funny the first time it basically is a movie to belittle blondes and to record the whole repetoir of blonde sum it all up this movie is blonde humor gone bad it is not worth paying any amount of money to watch it is just that bad
the person who wrote the glowing review of this misguided project must be related to the is in fact the same person as it defies rational thinking that this movie would be appealing to anyone not connected to a very tightly woven inner circle how about this you want to make a a story entertain draw me in with vivid characters sure you can do it artfully without bowing to the commercial elements designed for mass appeal however do not address elements of artistic expression in a vacuum in which the audience is in a continual struggle to grasp at skimpy narrative threads if i'm to be moved by a dreamy psychological thread then make the concrete fabric easier to buy
time is precious this film isn't i must learn to ignore critics who rave about small films like fargo and this complete waste of theater was packed and everyone left with the same reaction is this the film the critics are raving about what a piece of hook of this film is the upwardly mobile black daughter seeking out and finding her white trash family get acting is production sets editing sound is about steps above a minutes story the characters are shallow and unintelligent i was insulted by the fact that these people could not figure out about each other what was blatantly obvious to the audience the audience was murmuring to the movie screen what the characters should say have had more fun doing the laundry
rumor has it that when the nasa technical advisors to this film were asked to keep the picture believable they laughed for several hours after all unless you are a politician or the shuttle you are not going to get in the shuttle furthermore space camp is in alabama not truth is everyone on earth will win multi-billion dollar lottery prizes before the events depicted in this film ever become possible this film was meant for kids and had to have been written by one because they are not aware of the myriad restrictions and requirements regarding access to is the most useless film of all time and it was a well deserved flop
i thank god i didn't go to cinema for this film i would be very sorry for the money i gave i saw it on tv and i couldn't beleive my eyes i wonder if any film could be worse than this one they spent millions of dollars to this film for nothing awful acting and awful scenario i think the other people who wrote comments are the man working from that film company very big fiasco in year can they still laugh at this kind of film embarassing
i saw this movie way back at the first theatrical release in a justifiably empty theater believe it or not after decades of watching movies this one still sticks clearly in my mind as the worst movie of all time or at least the worst that i would allow myself to acting is far beneath the standard set by any random group of drunken high-school students yanked off the street and forced to learn their lines in minutes or the first shock of disbelief we laughed for a while as each scene hit new lows but after a while even that dubious pleasure wore off and it just got to be really sad
i wasn't terribly impressed with season offering in homecoming it wasn't much of a horror story but rather a smart political statement with the undead screwfly situation is the story of a virus unleashed on the world that causes sexual drive to replaced with murderous tendencies toward women the episode starts out all right with a short film explaining the way the screw fly was killed of by scientists then there is short scene where a man is arrested when females bodies are discovered in his home i assume this is supposed to show the beginning of the outbreak but is unclear because this is never revisited the episode go ons for a while introducing characters blah blah seems cool and mysterious but the episode stars to get worse and worse as it lurches forward until its sad and unsatisfying end the worst episode well except for chocolate
how do i begin this movie is probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen it has no redeemable qualities i just sat through this movie and it was a failed to get even a single smile on my find it hard to believe that anyone would distribute this horrible film i felt that this movie was a failed attempt at distasteful humor the only thing that was worth anything about this movie was the soundtrack i'm pretty sure thats the reason i wanted to see this movie in the first will wrap this up as i am going to try and forget the time i just wasted with this piece of crap i will leave you with this warning do not watch this film it sucks
i only watched this movie because i was so impressed with olivier martinez in swat but this is no swat swat had a plot and some likable characters and made sense bullfighter had none of these should have realized that it couldn't possibly be any good after all the always painfully bad michelle forbes had a starring poster here called the movie incoherent another called it the worst movie ever both gave the movie far too much credit i am so glad i got it from the library for free yet i still feel ripped needs to include a in the rate this film vote just for movies like this one
went to see this movie hoping to see some flashes of the jet li we were amazed by in lethal weapon unfortunately too many of his fight stunts are so clearly fake that it took even that enjoyment out of it the flying kicks would be a lot more impressive if you couldn't see the wires holding him up as he flies through the air for seconds and cartoonish and very disappointing
yet another movie with an interesting premise and some wondrous special effects falling right into the trash direction and performances the exception of the lovely annabel schofield who is much cuter as a brunette and probably deserves better material and the ever earnest charlton heston earn the rating of a real amazing to watch heston perform up to his usual par and display how really bad this movie is he even plays in a sub-plot that kept me interested just to see how it tied back into the main line of the movie the way they ended up resolving it was that they didn't it simply falls off the don't waste your time on this one
what a long drawn-out pointless movie i'm sure that historically this film is delightful but as entertainment goes it just doesn't make the grade ralph fiennes has been in some fantastic movies the english patient list but this one was such a let-down it didn't seem to be going anywhere his character at the beginning was so shallow and uptight it amazes me that his sister would ever have been interested at all don't bother paying to rent this movie buy yourself a copy of the english patient instead
this is one of those movies trying to be moody and tense and instead ends up tripping all over itself having seen it at a queer film festival i was intrigued by the young college threesome gone wrong write-up however over-all ended up quite hard to critique a true story since not much that can be done about the plot but i found this disjointed melodramatic and wholly depressing dark and almost sinister painting a darn creepy flash of the seventies with imposing music and jerky close-ups it just doesn't work some scenes where so cheesy that instead of hushed awe my audience was supressing snickers and rolling story has an interesting premise but this just spins downward into a dark miserable spiral
this movie has many problem associated with it that makes it come off like a low budget class project from someone in film school i have to give it credit on its campiness though many times throughout the movie i found myself laughing hysterically it was so bad at times that it was comical which made it a fun you're looking for a low-grade slasher movie with a twist of psychological horror and a dash of campy ridiculousness then pop a bowl of popcorn invite some friends over and have some agree with other comments that the sound is very bad dialog is next to impossible to follow much of the time and the soundtrack is kind of just there
what you were not aware that scooby-doo battled zombies well you might also not be aware of this little film that was directed by victor halperin who had also directed white zombie four years earlier that would probably make it the second zombie film don't go looking for dorothy stone to expose her breasts as you would expect in most zombie films and don't even look for any brains being eaten this is you what you will see is typical of the period lots of do get to see dean jagger o'clock high and bela eyes but that is about it zombies in cambodia indeed
i don't know who got the idea that orcas go around killing people and bashing and destroying things for revenge but my god is it absurd orcas are most definitely not the cold-blooded killer this movie makes them out to silly orcas are extremely intelligent don't get me wrong but i highly doubt they know and understand a concept such as revenge so i have to say all i got out of this movie was the entertainment of how preposterous it was so i was at least somewhat amused by it personally i'd recommend going and seeing jaws if you're wanting to see an animal-killing-humans type of movie but if you're like me and want to laugh at something this far from realism then i'd say go ahead d
i watched this video at a house i'm glad i did not waste money buying this one the video cover has a scene from the movie capricorn one the movie starts out with several clips of rocket blow-ups most not related to manned flight smoking gun is a short video clip of the astronauts preparing a video broadcast he edits in his own voice-over instead of letting us listen to what the crew had to say the video curiously ends with a showing of the zapruder film his claims about radiation shielding star photography and others lead me to believe is he extremely ignorant or has some sort of ax to grind against nasa the astronauts or american in general his science is bad and so is this video
i actually didn't enjoy this saw it at a camp and we didn't rave about it we laughed at it sure some parts are touching but the acting is terrible the effects are terrible and the whole overall movie idea is terrible i know it was based on a book which i haven't read but i hope that the book was better than this because frankly i thought that this movie was very bad and boring like i said i went to it with a bunch of people from a camp and we were excited to be there plus i got a caffeinated drink but nonetheless i struggled to stay awake the only thing that kept me up than my fear of being embarrassed once i woke up was the gunshots that were quite pointless as well i just really didn't like it
didn't know anything about the film or that it was based on a best selling guessing from the opening scenes what it would be treasure and a death lasted about minutes when i got the sneaky suspicion that the film was not bore you with how bad the plot and acting were but anyone who gave it more than two stars must work for the film watched until the hero jumped into his corvette to rush to the had his on his and tie arrived at the hospital in jeans and a even get the continuity right i got the christian to miss it
strange how less than hours can seem like a lifetime when sitting through such flat uninspiring drivel if a story is as personal as this supposedly was to sally potter wouldn't you expect a little passion to show through in her performance her acting was completely detached and i felt no chemistry between sally and pablo and the tango scenes which should have been fiery given the nature of the dance were instead awkward and painful to watch obviously revealing such a personal story on film can be daunting and as such sally potter would have been wise to let a better actor take on the task rather than let her passion fall victim to her own sheepishness
this movie offers nothing to anyone it doesn't succeed on any level the acting is horrible dull long-winded dribble they obviously by the length of the end sex scene were trying to be shocking but just ended up being pretty much a parody of what the film was aiming for complete garbage i can't believe what a laughable movie this was i'm very sure rosario dawson ended up in this film cause she though this would be her jarring break away indi hit a wowing movie the problem is no adult is going to stick with this film as the film plays out like a uninteresting episode of the oc or something aimed at teens pathetic
the first one was the best the second one sucked because the dialog was terrible although the storyline wasn't so bad fact all story lines are good and bad throughout the movie i dosed off a few times i know that jackie chan is a great martial arts expertise but not a good actor in rush hour chris tucker too wasn't good and zhang ziyi what can i say a few lines terrible acting based on her script all the characters there were not that good but some of the things i like in rush hour is always the action and less sex scenes i know that jackie chan doesn't do those things which is good for him
if i could i would give zero stars for this one but unfortunately i have to give is no single scene i could laugh about but the game didn't make me laugh either so if you're some ill retarded folk go to your local cinema watch this movie and give it stars like some people here already for me in a movie where children are shot dead to achieve humor good taste goes over the edge this was the third time i wasted my time to see a boll movie and it was definitely my i'm ashamed of being from the same country as uwe please keep him from making more movies
this has to be the worst movie ever the acting is scarier than the movie lots of blood but no idea where it comes from cuz they don't even show you the cuts i can't believe i wasted my time watching this movie we laughed like we were watching a comedy and not a horror movie this is a disgrace to horror films for one if they are in asia why is there a white cop driving past waste management trash cans so much of another language that you don't even know going on half the time the film editing is a joke my teenager could do better and if i went to a movie theater and that nasty old man was working the window that would be the first clue do not watch this movie not to even see how bad it is you will be sorry you did
i wanted to like this movie but many elements ruined it for me the use of a fisheye lens throughout and choppy editing did not give me a sense of being in the world of the meth head but it did make me think i was watching mtv for a few short moments the movie never did seem to go anywhere and the acting was truly an excellent example of over acting i love movies that give us a glimpse into the seedy underworld but this film couldn't decide if it was a bad horror film or an even worse serious commentary on the horrors of addiction
i enjoy quality crapness and this ranks up there with some of the finest the cg is out of this world or at least pre-dates our world and the insanity of a foot bloke in a rat outfit chasing after people is laughably bad i quite enjoyed some of this but the acting is so goddamn awful and even the obligatory nude scene doesn't really have any baps out in it just a complete waste of time if ever i saw one i don't know who wasted more time me watching this or the poor saps who got dragged into making it in the faint hope that this will launch their acting careers i can assure you it wont however on a brighter note i have managed to successfully do the degrees of kevin bacon from this movie so i think it was almost worthwhile watching the minutes of it
movie about a small town with equal numbers of mormons and baptists new family moves in cue the overwritten dialog mediocre acting green jello salad with shredded carrots and every other inside mormon joke known to man anyone outside the mormon culture will have a hard time stomaching this movie anyone inside the mormon culture will be slightly amused with a chuckle here and there you'll be much better off watching other movies dynamite etc than trying to sit through this one the acting is mediocre jared hess has had his hands on much more quality films like saints and soldiers and napoleon dynamite i would recommend both movies over this groaner
this cult movie has two crazed lesbians locke colleen camp appearing at the home of wealthy socialite doctor george manning cassel in hope of help in locating a residence they can't seem to find but these two have other plans in mind when they find out wife is out of town they end up taking control of the residence tying up the george killing a delivery boy while destroying the place all in one evening bizarre and disturbing movie but the two get there just reward in the same bizarre way as the movie ends most will either dislike it right off or get caught up in this ludicrous movie after about minutes into it either way some even consider this a cult dodson
when i was a kid we always used to be babysat and we always used to rent a film or see a film at the cinema this is one of the films we watched this is one of the stupidest films i've ever seen i think it might even be a walt disney pictures film a martian is dropped on earth turns into a human befriends a human and is trying everything he can to get back home but he is distracted by the wonders of the earth the only good comment i can give is the choice of actors back to the christopher lloyd as the martian uncle martin dumb and jeff daniels as tim o'hara elizabeth hurley as brace channing and daryl hannah as lizzie but apart from that complete crap poor
painful painful is the only word to describe this awful rendition of such a fun and interesting shakespearean play i gave it a shot but was terribly disappointed and couldn't bare to even finish viewing it to the person who wrote a novel about how wonderful this twist of much ado was i pity you and your bored brain may your pretenses about young viewers be lifted without retribution please do not even bother with this gut wrenching disgusting excuse for a performance of an acclaimed shakespeare drama you will be forced to induce vomiting and will require a commode close to the television with which you choose to watch this crap because involuntary defecation will take place
after being hugely entertained by mr performance as a cad in the tailor of panama i rate across the board casting acting script story editing pace music emotional impact etc i enthusiastically anticipated this film i was hugely disappointed it is a script reading not a film vulgar for the sake of being vulgar bankrupt in every way that the tailor of panama is rich and satisfying blame it on the screen writing and directing i sat in the theater waiting for the good part it never came i neither laughed nor cried although one line of dialog did make me smile worth hardly
i'm a fan of arty movies but regretfully i have to report this movie to be pretentious drivel agonisingly slow to develop a non-existent plot based on a promising premise the experience is shall we say trying even after bad movies i feel that i learn something or enjoyed some aspect but there there was nothing to appreciate the premise was not uninteresting but the movie starts and ends there the acting was ok though the characters were utterly boring for the protagonist to aim at such an audacious goal she is mightily empty pity i usually enjoy movies that are unformulaic but lack of formula should not be confused with zero content
this is no doubt one of the worst movies i have ever seen this makes your run of the mill tv movie look like reservoir dogs based on a book by the one and only britney spears and her mother this is trash with nothing bar a reasonable performance from virginia madsen hope you got paid well to save it the story of a red neck country gill who wins a scholarship in a prestigious music school is little but a vehicle to pedal ms spears pants music to the consumer and to generally agree that low brow must be the way there is nothing good going on here with all the beats as predictable as night following day never ever again
when i refer to malice as a film noir i am not likening it to such masterpieces as sunset boulevard double indemnity or the maltese falcon nor am i comparing director becker to alfred hitchcock stanley kubrick stanley kramer or luis bunuel i am merely registering a protest against the darkness that pervades this movie from start to finish to the extent that most of the time you simply cannot make out what is going on i can understand darkness in night scenes but this movie was dark even in broad daylight for what reason i am at loss to understand as it is however it wouldn't have made much difference if director becker had filmed it in total darkness
this one features all the effect of cheap-o movies but is so overtly racist nasty and unpleasant that it is difficult to give this piece of dreck any redeeming feature unless you plan to enlist in the marines skip this one oh and even if you do avoid it at all costs
this movie is just plain terrible slow acting slow at getting to the point and wooden characters that just shouldn't have been on there the best part was the showing of iron maiden singing in some video at a theater and thats it the ending was worth watching and waiting up for but that was it the characters in this movie put me to sleep almost avoid it
i give this marriage years and thats stretching it adrianne curry is fouled mouth spoiled controlling loud and her bi sexual past makes me laugh she tells chris he has an image to protect and must avoid strip clubs he married her chris has low self esteem and from a different time warp i have nothing against adrianne curry but this combination is not gonna have a happy ever after ending her mother said he was an old rooster and thinks this is his last attempt to recapture his youth here very good people who are gonna end up in a nasty divorce i don't think his old brady family is gonna fit into his new life i see them being shut out chris said his friends were more important than his family the supported him and was there for him
dr mordrid is terrifying i would not recommend any adult or child see this unless they are rampaging murderers already there is so much filth in this movie it hurts my yes speaking of eyes there are eyes in the sky against a backdrop of stars only the devil himself could have imagined such a wicked thing i rented out every copy i could from local video stores and crushed them with a pound crucifix that movie should remain locked in a cellar behind the dimension with all the other disgusting beasts of hell that is where this movie belongs i suggest if you want some scandalous entertainment go and rent all dogs go to heaven or angels in the outfield those movies are worth seeing if you want to commit a sin and love terrible movies you need to see dr mordrid
saw it yesterday night at the midnight slam of the festival des films du monde in montreal what a disappointment this movie is clearly over rated by imdb fans the acting was only but regular the directing didn't bring anything new or interesting the plot lacks considerably the movie is all about those college grads and the game they play making prank and on top of that you can predict the end in the first five minutes if you like prank calls and a slasher with an axe that makes you jump only once or twice during the whole movie you might like it if you don't this movie is not worth it
i don't have much to say about this movie it could have been a wonderful tour-de-force for peter sellers but it is one of the most tragic misfires in movie history that it was sellers final movie makes it all the more terrible screenplay direction and shockingly wooden performances all come dreadfully together to make this one of the most unwatchably awful movies ever wish so much that i could find even a snicker or a chuckle buried somewhere in this pile of putrid blubber but a lifeless humorless disaster the truth why couldn't you have stopped at being there
you loose iq points just for tuning in this show has to be awful i refuse to tune in from just what i've seen in commercials where did they dig this guy up at anyway also what do they intend to do next season the secret is out everyone already knows the set up are they going to look for people who has been living under a rock to star in next season where are they going to dig up more stupid women no wonder america is a big joke to what you are watching
this movie is worth watching if you enjoy marvelling over special effects there are some interesting from that typical hollywood fare of dazzle without substance true to the not worth picking apart the story like performing brain surgery on a dinosaur not much there to begin with nothing original and not very special so don't go in for the story at all just look at the has been mentioned it got a little flashy at the end diluting the purity of great fx treatment of an invisible at times half invisible man however if you ignore the standard pyrotechnics a sight to behold not to in all a decent fx film worth seeing for that purpose and that alone
this was on the anniversary dvd for blazing saddles itself brilliant but not this nowhere did i see mel name on here and i can guess why got a lot more sense to not be associated with this pilot my gawd who would find this funny sure there may be a race issue but for me it just wasn't funny well cause simply not funny like the writers didn't even try to be funny just to cash in on being tied with blazing saddles did they expect this show to go for several seasons when they made this pilot flat out they didn't care it was a quick cash cow which thank god didn't cash out i guess useful for historical purposes only or only to demonstrate how stupid and unimaginative hollywood writers can be
the director tries to be quentin tarantino the screenwriters try to be tennessee williams deborah kara unger tries to be faye dunaway the late james coburn tries to be orson welles michael rooker tries to be gene hackman mary tyler moore tries to be faye dunaway version cameron diaz tries to get out of the frame as quickly as she can don't ask about joanna going eric stoltz and james spader try to conceal their embarrassment with this crappy stuff it delivers endless meaningless dialog and very little is a town with beautiful elevator lobbies an art deco church by bruce goff and a lovely sprawling mansion by frank lloyd wright visit tulsa don't watch this movie it doesn't do the location justice
this true story of raiders is more of a army training film than anything thrown together quickly on a miniscule budget about the only thing it has to recommend it is an early performance by robert the only decent actor in the actual footage of the wreckage at pearl harbor which gets your blood it was obviously intended to do
i can't believe that so many are comparing this movie to his work is far more imaginative and a lot more director simply lacks the ability to build real tension the murder face it what this genre is all interesting it was not hard to guess who the murderer was and i really didn't care when it was revealed the cinematography isn't memorable and the much-praised century gothic atmosphere just didn't draw me in several of the actors are quite good the headmistress and the sadistic girl who lords it over the younger students but they're given very little to there are undertones of incest sadomasochism and lesbianism but amazingly they add very little spice or suspense you're looking for a good horror movie look elsewhere
don't what to say this is a film that could be really good a with a bunch of stoned viewers some of the acting reminded me of john waters early offerings perhaps i should take that don't want to insult waters ability as a particularly loved the lawyer taking about the full faith and credibility clause full faith and credit by the also reminds me of the conrad boys where the main actor is also the writer director film editor etc those sort of multi-involved undertakings such as that are probably best left to very seasoned film professionals who would have the technical ability a stunt some might say to pull something off like that
the film looks super on paper a romantic comedy in which a frantic lover gets dragged into a smuggling thriller should be generic cross-breeding gold especially with this excellent romcomic afraid lawrence kasdan simply gives his two stars too much rope though and they duly go and hang themselves adam brooks script may well be to blame but you'd expect better from the kevin kline of a fish called wanda instead the two ping-pong off one another and the unlikely burgeoning romance is never reconciled satisfactorily with the reason either of them are in and dashing around reno co-stars amiably as the cop-with-a-heart and i guess wishes he was a star-with-a-part mind you he went on to do those pink panther so perhaps he was ok with this
susan swift is an appealing youngster a flower child transplanted to the a young susan dey but she doesn't quite have the vocal range for a demanding dramatic lead and she tends to whine still rather sweet and has bright eyes and a pretty smile in the coming it was called when briefly released to theaters swift may be the reincarnation of a salem witch the flick is very low-budget and borrows from so many other pictures that i gave up on it with about minutes to go it starts out strong and has some camp appeal obviously there are more serious films that deal with the salem witch trials that deserve to be seen over this one however as junk movies go it isn't too terrible the boston locales are a definite plus and the supporting cast is amusingly hammy from
i saw this movie at sundance and was stunned at how bad it was although based on the catalog description i was excited to see it supposedly a mockumentary of two high school students making a documentary of high school life it featured bad acting bad directing completely lack of engaging characters as written and all-around is a total bust i love good movies about high school and this is not one of them the characters are one-dimensional and self-consciously cool although they are supposed to be outcasts you get the overall impression of a bunch of people sitting around making an on-purposely-bad movie to show their friends yet somehow it got into sundance mystifying
i may have seen worse films than this but i if i have i don't remember or possibly blocked them out who i was to undergo hypnotherapy i may remember them along maybe with been abducted by aliens as a child or other traumas if so i would happily exchange those memories for the ones i have of watching this should give the film some credit it did produce an emotional response i actually started to become angry at scenes that spoofed other films and tv programs that this travesty was dirtying them by association i am terrified that i may be unable to watch films like dr strangelove again without this film flitting across my minds eye
visually disjointed and full of itself the director apparently chose to seek faux-depth to expand a minute plot into an minute snore-fest moments that work in this film are very limited and the characters don't even feel real how could you feel invested in a main protagonist who was made so surreal and stylistically it all feels like a quirky dream sequence jarring irregular camera work awkward silences and gaps in action and with the little spider image crawling across the screen whoever thought of that needs to go back to film school it added no meaning just cheese and didn't even stylistically work with the rest of the film the film even had a style which is a close call what a flop
i know john a smart guy coz he made boyz n the hood so how did he write and direct this like the pilot of a bad going away to college for the first time teen soap a parade of boring stereotypes and cliches with some gratuitous violence thrown in to make it a commercial proposition i guess who would've guessed the date-rape victim would dump sausage for seafood the angry loner would be preyed upon by a group of neo-nazis would be roomed-up with a black and a jew just for laughs even laurence creepy reactionary history professor just irritated me and i love the guy like everyone involved with this movie just lost the plot except busta rhymes of course big ups
had i watched it in my teenage years this movie was mildly entertaining what i liked about soul survivors were the gothic atmosphere during the party scenes and the constant flips between dream and there not been movies like the sense and don't look now i would have been surprised by the ending
all right i recently got a chance to rent this and watch santa claus conquers the martains although the children were much more sadistic in scctm i would have to say that santa claus was a much worse movie as a spanish assignment in spanish we all had to watch it i'll tell you usually when we watch a movie we are all just talking and eating food but not for this movie everyone just kept there jaw open wondering what the evil mr pitch was going to do next would merlin help santa claus or would his robot reindeer come and save the day i would suggest renting it because it is the biggest piece of rubbish i have ever seen and i love it for that d
this movie deserves more than a but i'm giving it a one because so many fricken fan boys have given it a resulting in it getting a rating that'll take it into the top list seriously not that great its not that bad its a stupid cult classic with so many fricken fan boys ridiculous these are the types who probably still laugh at chuck norris jokes and still say i'm rick james no matter how old or annoying it gets i dread having to hear i'm tired of mfn snakes on this mfn plane months from now from idiots trying to be funny its crappy plot crap acting etc its okay to love a bad movie but you still gotta admit its a bad for the marine starring john cena if you wanna see a real movie
amateurism best describes the film adaptation of the best-selling philosophical novel the celestine prophecy which follows the spiritual awakening of an out of work teacher in a mysterious village in peru home video quality actors present so-called characters spewing overwrought exposition and metaphysical hokum while the film is propelled by the extremely heavy-handed direction of armand mastroianni even though there are visible attempts at measuring up to and interesting fans of stronger fare in the vain of lost or dan the da vinci code the filmmakers are hardly up to the task this film reeks of ill-conceived mass consumption spiritual propaganda and the results are so awful few can wade through this mess to spot a real point
this movie is some of the worst crap i have ever seen i literally got a sharp pain in my head while watching this movie the cgi was awful and the story was just a waste of ink dean character was mr-super-intuitive-i-can-figure-out-anything except he can't seem to work his own helicopter correctly the biggest problem was the split screen camera work i felt like i was watching the brady bunch or something only it wasn't different people in the boxes just close ups and different views of the same thing i can only figure that the actors really needed the money because this movie wasn't worth the film it was shot on
an uninteresting addition to the stalk n slash cycle which dominated the horror genre in the this was filmed as pranks but released as the dorm that dripped blood which is an obvious steal from the horror anthology the house that dripped blood daphne zuniga is the only recognisable face in the cast and this was her first horror movie has also appeared in the initiation and the fly ii
i was thirteen years old when i saw this movie i expected a lot of action since escape from new york was in germany i entered the movie as fallback it was so boring afterwards i realized that this was just crap where a husband exhibits his wife i mean today you do this via internet and you pay for instant access it is more then years ago but i am still angry that i waste my time with this film this is a soft-porno for schoolboys undressing bo derek and painting her with color nice but then they should named the film undressing bo and painting her
this movie let me down decidedly hard it was a great concept that was ruined with a horrible script the story just didn't flow and was disjointed at best there were so many elements to this story that were not explained or were forced into place with out any real thought elements like the love story could have been expanded on a bit more and the cannons need to be written in better the whole main character growing up thing needed more about the training he was receiving and less standing around everyone likes a good little guy overcomes story and this showed promise but with the scripting failures wasn't to be while it did have some pyrotechnics in the final battle sequence it was lackluster due to a lack of choreography this made for a maddeningly boring could have been so good
saw this movie in my english class this afternoon and was surprised by how bad this version was don't get me wrong george c scott was terrific as scrooge but the rest of the cast fails so very badly sometimes i couldn't stop laughing at the stupid acting and the repeated line merry christmas to everyone other times i almost fell movie is based on a charles dickens short story about a rich guy who don't think christmas is nothing but humbug after minutes the rich guy is visited by three ghosts who persuade him to celebrate christmas after can not understand how this movie with a script so bad it must have been written in five minutes can be so well-rated instead of this piece of garbage i recommend to you the bill murray comedy scrooged that at least was funny
like all the taviani brothers films this one looks great but it is rotten to the core with false romanticism and coincidences heap upon each other in some facsimile of a story in actuality this is really just a sentimentally cheap tear jerker posing as an intellectually distinguished art film
an illegal immigrant resists the social support system causing dire consequences for many well filmed and acted even though the story is a bit forced yet the slow pacing really sets off the conclusion the feeling of being lost in the big city is effectively conveyed the little person lost in the big society is something to which we can all relate but i cannot endorse going out of your way to see this movie
i was raised in a very christian household since birth i was saved before i saw this movie and the rest of the series and was forced to watch it in a youth group at my church this movie was highly disturbing i saw it when i was about years old and literally had nightmares about it for years i used to lay awake in bed and listen for the sounds of my footsteps upstairs if i didn't hear her footsteps i would sneak upstairs to make sure she hadn't been raptured i used to pray so hard every night for salvation because i was terrified of jesus forgetting me this is definitely not something i will show to my kids until they are much older if at all it took me years to shake the fear that this movie gave me
quite possibly how francis veber one of the best comedy directors in the world least when sticking to his native france managed to turn in a film so completely unwatchable is beyond the reason of mere mortal man to discern not just that the characters are so unlikeable or that the film is so utterly devoid of even the lowest form of wit genuinely physically painful to watch such an endless parade of inept writing acting and film-making that you cannot believe this is the work of experienced and talented filmmakers for once the near-eternity spent in the cutting room and on the shelf before its blink-and-you'll-miss-it theatrical release tells the whole story what were they thinking
this movie was just plain bad just about every cop movie clich√© is present and accounted for bad guy gets away check partner check wacky personality clash with partner check rookie with something to prove check rookie shows up grizzled veteran check about the only ones it didn't touch on were idiot shoot themselves in the foot and retirony but i guess they're saving those old chestnuts for next outing add in the battle of the sexes with girl power along with tired old sight gags and banal overdone material like prize car getting trashed all the time and you have the recipe for one really bad movie avoid this one at all costs
hello i am from denmark and one day i was having a film evening with my friends one brought this movie with him russian terminator and it was extremely awful after watching less than half a minute we decided to fast forward only stopping at some laughable highlights or should i say lowlights in the movie i was actually mostly surprised to find out that this film was produced here in my homeland must have been the biggest mistake this country ever made
men do i love police movies filled with action shooting chases was i let down after watching this short and unsatisfying movie we've seen it all before the hostages the bank the surrounding yet bad guys that shoot down multiple officers and innocent people who simply stay in the line of fire without getting hit due to some just a few shots no hundreds of shots going back into the bank where the dumb hostages didn't lock the safe or doors when the bad guys went out how stupid did the director think we'd the shots in between that fake a documentary were good but after seeing the film i only got the thought why didn't the police get a decent shooting course and why where there so many cops and was swat on a real long break truly bad
what a stinkeroo this turned out to be at one time much earlier in her career linda darnell was one of my favorites no great shakes as an actress but very beautiful and pleasant in films like the mark of zorro and blood and sand but when i saw this monstrosity the memories of her golden days faded quickly the story is unbelievable and farcical the acting second-rate the supporting cast insufferable i cannot think of a more immature performance by anyone when compared to tab hunter and donald gray had to be the most boring leading man they could have picked added to this was the terrible photography i am not just referring to the color everyone associated with this must have shuddered whenever it was shown
obsession with dannielynn smith is despicable leave the child alone with all the constant attention she'll most likely grow up psychotic depressed or worse think of princess diana and how she longed for privacy now poor little rich girl ashley olson just wants to be left alone no wonder greta garbo became a recluse and said i want to be alone how much does et make off this little girl does et not have anything better to report on i bet lots of people who really don't care what color her birthday cake and balloons were by the way i never heard that anna nichole ever won any of those court cases over the will and her inheritance who is paying for the lifestyle of larry howard and little dannielynn could it be et
this is a bad b movie masquerading as a mockumentary the porn documentary filmmaker in the movie has almost as much screen time and dialog as any other character that completely destroyed any documentary feel that they may have wanted to fact that the film is not actually a mockumentary is the least of problems the film is not funny the film is not sexy the film doesn't have anything insightful to say about the porn business not even particularly salacious while simulated sex the amount of nudity is mild for an r rated someone will make a good mockumentary about the porn industry this is not it
the haunting a remake of course the original was a creepy psychological thriller and one that has improved with time compared to this remake a classic there is no character development here only caricatures slut the authoritative brain the i'm gonna get us outta here fellow the oh so sensitive bookworm but seeing as how the were banking on the special effects being the star i guess characters that you can empathize with are a secondary concern unfortunately the effects are laughable mewing cherubs stretchy doors irritating dead children that can't speak plainly and an idiotically sappy ending that does darnedest to give you a new age enema of butterflies and rainbows ill take my skittles orally thank you bruce dern i've liked you since the cowboys stop it
if you want to laugh like crazy rent cage cage is about two war heroes billy and scott who are best friends when billy is shot in vietnam he is unable to fend for himself so scott takes him have never seen a movie with more gay references to the two main characters billy and scott love to wrestle and scott tells billy that he is still sore from last night among other catch phrases like shut the up and ping pang pong cut the will keep you laughing for hours the native american guys that are supposed to be playing mexican gang members are also top notch as they say party time right now ba-ba-ba-ba ba-ba i could go on forever but just watch this movie and laugh your off it was so funny i went out and bought the dvd for
john leguizemo a wonderful comic actor is a new york latino able to get inside a myriad of characters both male and female to show the bizarre foibles of an ethnic group trying to cope in an alien culture he is not however italian he doesn't look think or behave sicilian or calabrese immigrant groups who live in bensonhurst or bayridge brooklyn every scene in which he interacts with his gumbas rings false as though he'd wandered in from a college production of west side story while the other guys were doing a low-rent mean streets only one problem with this ill-conceived mean-spirited flick spike blew this one big time btw cbgbomfug means country bluegrass blues and other music for uplifting gourmets possibly gourmands ask hilly crystal who founded the club
probably the worst bollywood film i've plot line very little character of silly and pointless humor the whole film was chaotic and direction-less there was no proper ending to the story the airport was filmed in a shopping mall story chewed over and over again until you want to say please just move on with it even the song and dance was pointless and badly only good thing about this movie is that there were hot bods all around but then most of the bollywood movies have that anyways these i'm not from an indian
absolutely horrific film ameteurish and it isn't funny at all lead character played by mehmet ali erbil is very annoying edits by and star wars is just plain yilmaz goksal is the only good think about this movie he should master his english and move to hollywood hollywood can not find an actor with his qualities other than goksal this movie is a gani mujde is a comic writer and this movie is his worst written work to this of cem karaca is another plus of this waste of money actor sumer tilmac also have some presence actor who plays the three sons has no talent what so ever
lame lame lame a cringe-fest minutes too long a setting ripe with atmosphere and possibility abandoned convent is squandered by a stinker of a script filled with clunky witless dialogue straining oh-so-hard to be hip mostly just embarrassing and the attempts at gonzo horror fall flat sample of this dialogue after demonstrating her artillery fast dolly shot to a closeup of vigilante character she questions hyuck hyuck hyuck bad acting idiotic homophobic jokes and judging from the creature effects it looks like the watched evil dead way too many times owe my friends big time for renting this turkey and subjecting them to ninety wasted minutes they'll never get back what a turd
from the beginning of the movie it gives the feeling the director is trying to portray something what i mean to say that instead of the story dictating the style in which the movie should be made he has gone in the opposite way he had a type of move that he wanted to make and wrote a story to suite it and he has failed in it very badly i guess he was trying to make a stylish movie any way i think this movie is a total waste of time and effort in the credit of the director he knows the media that he is working with what i am trying to say is i have seen worst movies than this here at least the director knows to maintain the continuity in the movie and the actors also have given a decent performance
i was looking forward to this ride and was horribly i am very easily amused at roller coaster and amusement park roller coaster part was just okay and that was all of about seconds of a second ride was visually dull and poorly executed was trying desperately to be like a mixture of the far superior indiana jones and space mountain rides and disneyland and failed in every was not thrilling or exciting in the least
the movie opens with a meteor crashing into a lake unbeknownst to the locals a dinosaur egg is also at the bottom of the lake the meteor heats the lake turning it into a giant incubator you guessed it the egg hatches releasing a dinosaur that proceeds to terrorize the what utter garbage not that i mind the stop-motion clay dinosaur everything else about the movie that bothers me the acting is atrocious the dialogue is utterly ridiculous the comic relief is anything but comic logic is non-existent any similarity between the scientists in this movie and an actual scientist is purely coincidental i could go on for an eternity on the bad aspects of this movie but you get the idea i feel fairly safe to call this disaster worthy
this is one of the worst films i've seen in years you could randomly pluck people off the streets and they could act better than anyone in this film absolute waste of time watching it i only gave it a as i like gory films but this is just plain rubbish the acting i use that term very loosely is abysmal someone please tell me that the main actors in this were making their first ever film don't waste your time watching this hostel was a better film by some way i cannot believe that someone has spent money making this i hope for the producers sake it only cost to make it looks like a school project made by kids who haven't got a clue did this even make it to the cinema
an ensemble of uninteresting and unlikeable characters twist and turn their way through a flimsy plot that might be interesting if only you could bring yourself to care this twisting and turning i speak of refers not to the story contains all the suspense of a recipe for tuna casserole but to the inability to keep the characters faces even remotely centered in the frame on the other hand angie harmon has very nice nostrils and left only real surprise in the movie is the big names they convinced to do it when you consider this movie was never released in theaters despite having an all-star cast you might be inclined to think something indeed it does
well it looked good on cage and jerry buckheimer collaborate again this time on a mix of heist movie da vinci history and indiana jones but oh dear this is to indiana jones what speed is to speed a reasonable john voight and harvey keitel battles against a puerile script and loses badly the film is little more than an extended advert for the these freemasons are not your usual shopkeepers who use funny handshakes and play golf these freemasons are the natural descendants of the knights templar nobody mention from hell or jack the don't think i've revealed any plot spoilers because there are none there is virtually no suspense no surprises and no it just stops national treasure aims for dan brown but hits the same intellectual level as an episode of scooby doo sans the humour
wow some movies just leave me speechless this was undeniably one of those movies when i left the theatre not a single word came to my mouth all i had was an incredible urge to slam my head against the theatre wall to help me forget about the last hour and a half unfortunately it didn't work honestly this movie has nothing to recommend the humor was at the first grade level at best the acting was overly silly and the plot was astronomically far-fetched i hearby pledge never to see an other movie starring chris kattan or any other cast-member of snl
i do agree that though this story by melville just might be unfilmable this isn't even a credible try to move the story into the century just outrages the original intent and nature possibly you might have been able to move it over to england but it must be a period piece even our story it in a flashback going back even further somewhere around towards the end of the century a strangely disobedient worker would be discarded without a thought and the century come on give me an expletive deleted break even around such behavior didn't work very well in view of the ending and the ending i don't know what it was because i didn't watch the entire had to stop this was like setting streetcar named desire in elizabethan england
it is amazing to me what passes for entertainment today maybe i am a dinosaur from the fifties and i am out of touch with todays movie going generation and apparently that is the case with regards to this movie since so many people loved it i found it foul and vulgar i haven't said that about many movies in my life but this one fits the bill the humor is sophomoric and crude i am not a politically correct person and even i found the gay jokes not only not funny but downright offensive i'm not gay the main character in the movie is not even a likable person just pathetic when the movie was finally over i heard a number of people comment on how disappointed they were in what they had just pay good money to see
i saw this film at its new high falls film festival screening as well and i must say that i found it a complete and awful bore although it was funny in some places the only real laughs was that there appeared to be o real plot to talk about and the acting in some places was dreadful and wooden especially the lovely lady and the voice of the narrator i have never heard of had a lot to be desired was i felt the redeeming feature of this film true action and grit and of the cast the only real acting i am sure with another cast and a tighter reign on the directing this could have been a half decent film let us just hope that it is not sent out on general release or if you really want a copy look in the bargain bin in lidl
lorenzo lamas stars as jack kelly an ex-vietnam vet and a renegade cop who goes on a search and destroy mission to save his sister from backwoods rednecks atrocious movie is so cheaply made and so bad that ron palillo is third billed and yet has minutes of screen time and even those aren't any good overall a terrible movie but the scenes with lorenzo lamas and josie bell hanging from a tree bagged and gagged are worth a few laughs followed by an improved sequel
i read the comment of from united wrote a fantastic documentary of this early century geography of iraq was would like to thank chris and people who are interested in bakhtiari nomads of iran the zagros mountains and landscapes and have watched the movie grass a battle for life these traditions you saw in the movie have endured for centuries and will go on as long as life endures i am from this region of iran myself i am a bakhtiari i am sorry to bother you but bakhtiari region of zardkuh is in iran not in irak as you mentioned in your comment iran and irak are two different and distinct countries taking an iranian for an irankian is almost like taking an american for an mexican
i'm sorry but i didn't like this doc very much i can think of a million ways it could have been better the people who made it obviously don't have much imagination the interviews aren't very interesting and no real insight is offered the footage isn't assembled in a very informative way either too bad because this is a movie that really deserves spellbinding special features one thing i'll say is that isabella rosselini gets more beautiful the older she gets all considered this only gets a
not totally off the wall in a good way but just totally stupid killer tongue is an uneasy mixture of sci-fi horror and supposed comedy what this equates to is a mindless and totally incoherent film there is very little dialog mainly due to the fact that the script if there was one is complete pond scum i wouldn't even call it strange more like just total nonsense this movie is certain to disappoint and you have been warned there is absolutely no reason to waste time on this and if you do the pungent smell will linger like rotten fish merk
this show made me feel physically sick and totally detached from british society as a whole it was programmes such as this and blue peter that pretended that there no class divisions in britain they'd always say things like go into your loft and you may find this or go into your back garden tonight and what about us scummy working class kids who never never had a loft and a back garden which was nothing more than a meter square of balcony on the floor of a council block public service broadcasting yeah right and on top of that it was awfully depressing to see those stupid middle class up-their-own-backside kids mess about with bits of old plastic having fun do me a favour and why don't you go and slit your wrists or do a coke overdose on mama and money you make me sick
in the beginning and throughout the movie it was great it was suspenseful and thrilling yet in the end it gave no answer to what had happened they mysteriously turned into zombies by a raven or crow it did not answer the questions that we all had and therefore was not as good a movie as i thought that it was going to be
imagine the worst skits from saturday night live and mad tv in one minute movie now imagine that all the humor in those bad skits is removed and replaced with stupidity now imagine something times now go see the underground comedy movie that vision you just had will seem like the funniest thing ever ucm is the single worst movie i've ever seen there were a few cheap few but it was lame even if the intent of the movie was to be lame it was too lame to be only reason i'm not angry for wasting my time watching this was someone else i know bought it he wasted his money vince offer hasn't written or directed anything else and not surprise why
oh my god what a horrible film the film has all the right people involved unfortunately it is not worth watching i saw it for free at my local library if i had paid to watch this i would be even more upset this film is unwatchable how could tarintino be involved with such a slow paced unexciting film no wonder it didn't get much distribution every one involved must have been ashamed i can make a better film with a dated camcorder and my big toe its beyond boring i really hated it tarintino just lost some standing in my eyes this must be some kind of sick joke don't bother with this film if some one even hints you should watch it kill them
cheap and manipulative this film has no also got dire dialogue unconvincing characters and a preposterous or rather non-existent story it just lurches from bad to worse in a cynical effort to wrench some kind of emotion from an insincere and unengaging the many cheap shots can a film take the hedgehog by the way gave the most convincing and watchable performance in this ninety-minute you have considered watching this film don't i'm sorry but i cannot find a single redeeming feature to this movie it scores a big fat zero with me strictly for sub-dogma knicker-wetters if you liked dancing in the
killer tomatoes movies have this special kind of humor you either love it or hate it i personally like it but in this fourth movie the feeling is gone the tomatoes aren't the same jokes are lame even the actors aren't as funny because the only thing this kind of movies are supposed to be now following the plot made to laugh is annoying they really shouldn't have done the fourth part to the killer tomatoes trilogy
this movie contains no humor for anyone who has lived with a family member who has a mental illness so many scenes reminded me too graphically of my own life experiences this movie was the version of mommy dearest it depicts both graphically and accurately the life many children of a mentally ill parent goes through it also shows how easy it is for a psychiatrist to become corrupt and act like they are god told me it was funny no way i say it is sick humor at best movie is so intense and depressing that my son and i had to leave the room the best use for this movie is for people who don't understand mental illness or don't believe what we families actually do live through
i saw this movie at the afi dallas festival most of the audience including my wife enjoyed this comedy-drama but i didn't it stars lucas haas alpha dog molly parker the five senses hollywoodland and adam scott snow art school confidential the director is matt bissonnette married to molly parker all three actors do a fine job in this movie about friends the marriage of two of them and infidelity involving the third it all takes place at a lake house and it looks wonderful the film wants to treat its subject as a comedy first and then a drama and i thought it needed to be the other way around
i have seen about a thousand horror films favorite type this film is among the worst for me an idea drives a movie so even a poorly acted cheaply made movie can be good something weird is definitely cheaply made however it has little to say i still don't understand what the karate scene in the beginning has to do with the film something weird has little to offer save yourself the pain
this movie begins with an ordinary funeral and it insists so hard on this ordinary funeral feel that i lost interest within minutes of watching and started skipping scenes it seems to me whomever made this movie is afflicted to the extent of becoming trapped in a permanent morbid trance unable to contemplate anything else but death and destruction well i ain't one of the dark kids from southpark i want a movie that within minutes gets me well into an interesting story i won't sit and watch minutes of nothing but preparations for a funeral my grandma on her last years was fascinated by funerals perhaps she might have enjoyed this movie
some people might consider this movie a piece of artwork to be able to express your imagination on film in order to create a movie filled with antagonizing pain and death i personally think that this movie is a disgust which should have never been released this movie is repulsive illogical and meaningless not only is it a complete waste of time but it makes you sick for days to come the appalling images shown in the film not only make you grasp for air but they set in your mind and it takes days to forget them such a shame that people waste their imagination on such inhumane suffering kill bill would be another example but at least kill bill has its purpose meaning climax and resolution
you know you're in trouble when the film your watching has numerous alternate titles generally it means that they tried and retried to hide the turkey in various markets such a turkey is the brain machine which has seven different about some super secret government project that is suppose to be able to use a computer to read people but instead it drives people to kill each other or themselves or something like that its filled with b level tv actors sitting in paneled room with lawn chairs trying to act a script that makes almost no a turkey of the untastey kind avoid it
although the movie takes place at an ivy league college it was in fact shot entirely in northern arizona mostly at northern arizona university in flagstaff in the fall of i was involved in the theater department there and most of the extras in the film are then-members of the theater department is an absolutely ludicrous scene in this film you know your arizona geography that shows several cast members riding bikes from the college to a creek we nau'ers know that the campus and said creek oak creek canyon are about miles apart and while the trip there is all downhill it would be literally impossible to ride a bike back up that same road
a friend of mine was in the cast as a feds agent non-speaking part as i recall he brought it over on dvd so i could see it it was interesting but very much felt like an amateur film a well made amateur film though really boring and poorly written it was probably fun to make and be involved in but it definitely didn't deserve any kind of wide release maybe in omaha they'd enjoy it but this california girl was bored and honestly kind of embarrassed for my this film maker has made or makes any more films he really should try to have a really interesting story line and good actors i'm sure this was a great learning tool for them i wish them luck in the future and hope they can improve their film making
the film lacks style i mean original style everything looks copied including action first appearances in the movie songs dialog delivery etc etc yes there the goof-ups were original like in the beginning a car is shown with number number and few seconds later it starts falling down a hill with number that was one in many goof-ups of the movie anything good in the movie yes for kareena fans if there are any kareena in bikini for akshay fans his dialogs and action stunts thats it nothing else so watch it on your own risk and don't blame the director or actors director is already insane and actors i pity them
motocrossed was fun but it wasn't that great i guess i just didn't understand a lot of the motocross racing lingo there was a lot of that in the film the plot wasn't what i expected from the disney channel previews so that could account for some of my disappointment
for shame for shame that a fine actor such as joseph fiennes would allow himself to be cast in this piece of nauseating drivel the movie was not only bad but down right horrible and of no redeeming quality the plot there one seemed to go no where the russians played silly kill or be killed games and the rest of the cast should be declared null and void for their pathetic performances i gave up about of the way through and turned it off a for awful only because there is nothing lower don't waste your time on this one you'll not miss anything
dont ever ever ever consider watching this sorry excuse for a film the way it is shot lit acted etc just doesn't make sense all so bad it is difficult to watch loads of clips are repeated beyond boredom there seems to be no normal person in the entire film and the existence of the outside world is well it just doesn't exist and why does that bald guy become invincible all of a sudden this film is beyond stupidity zero
definitely an odd debut for michael madsen madsen plays cecil moe an alcoholic family man whose life is crumbling all around him cecil grabs a phone book looks up the name of a preacher and calls him in the middle of the night he goes to the home and discusses his problems the preacher teaches cecil to respect the word of god and have jesus in his heart that makes everything all better only everything in life were that easy the fact that this film looks as if it was made with about certainly doesn't help
look carefully at the wonderful assortment of talent put together to make this movie connery fishburne capshaw harris underwood beatty thigpen even cameos by slezak lange and plimpton they prove in spades the adage that a good cast cannot save a bad script the story line requires so many leaps of faith from the audience that its implausibility should have exceeded even hollywood standards not particularly original and the twists are downright cruel
well i rented this movie while i was bed ridden hopped up on pain killers and let me say it didn't help the film film is about a man who buys a car as he is going through a midlife crisis he loves the car more than anything around him one day his wife decides to borrow the car since i don't want to spoil that there was anything to spoil i shall let your imagination figure out the zany i use that word lightly antics that had to fight to stay awake through this snore a minute sleeper of a film and i would like to say that if you are venturing to the movie store and are thinking about being adventurous please don't a waste of the film it was printed again i could be wrong
i rate this movie with skulls only coz the girls knew how to scream this could've been a better movie if actors were better the twins were ok i believed they were evil but the eldest and youngest brother they sucked really bad it seemed like they were reading the scripts instead of acting them spoiler if they're why do they freeze the blood vampires can't drink frozen blood the sister in the movie says drink her while she is then when they're moving to another house they take on a cooler they're frozen blood end of was a huge waste of time and that made me mad coz i read all the reviews of how this movie was great how many awards this movie won and this movie was
one stinko of a movie featuring a shopworn plot and to be kind acting of less than oscar caliber but to me the single worst flaw was the total misrepresentation of a jet aircraft and especially a some of the major no flight engineer even a flight engineer station mis-identifying the interceptors as resmblance whatsoever loading passengers into an aft baggage compartment supposedly accesible from the cabin even if such a compartment existed placing that much weight that far aft would make the aircraft unflyable hollow point bullets that won't damage the aircraft the entire landing procedure was so bad i wanted to puke an all planes with a pressure seal hatch opening a cabin door outward into the wind in nuts it was just a truly lousy movie gotta make the list of bottom of the year
the worst movie i have seen in quite a while interesting first half with some engaging terse dialogue among dubious characters in a late-night bar the movie then degenerates into a shapeless succession of scenes aiming for visual shock disgust without any redeeming observations or lessons in humanity or anything wanted to walk out but the director was present at this showing and my politeness preventing me from showing him disrespect still time is precious the director himself observed in his intro and i really begrudge the time i wasted on the second half of this graces were the three main characters in the first half of the movie especially the female lead
rural family perhaps a nod to ordinary a young boy who withdraws into himself after fatally wounding his older brother in a shooting mishap despite downbeat subject matter mercilessly glum treatment by director christopher cain there are some dynamics in this sad story worth exploring unfortunately the isolated farming atmosphere and the reluctance of the adult characters to take charge of the situation render the film a stultifying experience what with robert duvall glenn close and wilford brimley in the cast the movie is nearly a small-scaled reunion of the natural too bad this project didn't get the necessary talent behind the camera to really eke out a gripping memorable picture from
unfortunately for me the first busby berkeley movie i ever watched was street i then expected all of his stuff to be that good i found out that wasn't necessarily the case even here with my all-time favorite classic-era actor james the musical numbers at the end are as spectacular as always but the story is like many of the others and quite tiresome they seem to always involve screaming unhappy show producers in this film cagney who winds up shouting things out so often that he gives me a headache after awhile and his character wears the songs in here are anywhere near street class songs you could hum for years and years decades i should say the songs in this movie are not memorable no this is one of the few early cagney films and berkeley films i totally dislike and was very disappointed with while watching
if you are planning to see this movie please reconsider i don't usually post my comments about something i've seen on television but this one was such a waste of my life that i needed to do something productive to get that bad taste out of my mouth critiquing this movie would take far too long as there are so many things wrong with it i will just simply say please do not ever see this movie it was a complete waste of my time and it will be a waste of yours anyone that wrote a positive review of this movie is one of two things utterly inept or working for the company that produced it again i guarantee that you will indeed regret seeing this movie
ok so after watching this invigorating movie and wasting an hour and so many minutes off my life here is the basic summary genie comes out of ghetto boom box gives this kid with shaggy hair wishes the kid wastes his wishes on i forget what shaq sucks at rapping and i guess thats mainly i laughed i mainly i laughed at the shear comedy that came from the wonderful acting skills of an nba and boy with shaggy highly recommend this movie for college kids sitting around drinking some beers with their close friends and are in serious need of a good going to give it a out of only the movie is based off of magical i had wishes one would be to erase this horrible movie and for everyone to pretend like hollywood didn't waste money on making this
well i just ordered this on my pay-per-view at home because i was bored and needed a laugh i have to admit i did chuckle a few times but i don't even remember what parts they were at i don't understand why this movie was made it claims to be a comedy but seriousuly i don't find a singing penis or a naked year old woman very funny this movie was trying to fit itself into the gross-out comedies of recent years such as american pie and road trip but it just failed miserably it was way to much gross-out then it was comedy also why on earth did cameron diaz attach her name to this movie the only thing i liked about this movie was when dave and angela were in the pool i thought it was sexy and enjoyable and well-done besides that avoid this movie
well minutes of my life i won't get back this movie makes teen tv show california dreams look like almost famous the acting was horrid and storyline unrealistic don't even get me started on the actual band at the forefront of this story lame songs look etc you had to believe that they were one of the hottest bands in the country and there isn't enough irony in the world to accept that one the guitarist is seen to be a heroin user not that i blame him if i was around such a putrid band with stale songs and wooden acting i'd be injecting the horse you take music remotely seriously avoid this at all costs
urgh things a movie needs a good script a good plot and good casting i watched this movie expecting it to be hilariously terrible and was unfortunately disappointed when it was just plain terrible i lost the will to live halfway through the only thing which stopped me from stabbing my eyes out with a fork was rose byrne was the reason for me watching it in the first place she did a good job as rastus and her appearance hasn't changed much since she was it was a fantastic first effort in a movie the dog was also very good both did a great job with such awful material sandra bernhard i think was the biggest mistake of the movie she was completely miscast and i don't think she ever quite got the give the movie out of and thats only because of rose
so i got a hold of this as an assignment for trent harris who teaches occasionally in the film dept at the u of u i guess this is his only real way to get anyone to see his documentary section at the beginning dragged on yes the kid is a nut-job from no where but not good enough to keep it sean penn dressed as a onj is the only highlight and after about thirty seconds it loses all crispin glover takes on larry the story-telling was better but i just couldn't take anymore
i was staying in one night and got extremely bored around so i flipped aimlessly through the channels and happened upon where this classic was playing initially i was happy to have caught something at the beginning but my happiness faded about two minutes into the movie the whole movie centered around an unattractive man who had a fear of females four beautiful but empty minded women who worked as waitresses at his diner and his enormously fat and extremely miserable cousin who also works at the diner there are a few strange twists in this movie that make it somewhat interesting but certainly not worth watching basically if you have nothing to do some night or just can't sleep medication works much better however guys there is a lot of skin so it may be okay to watch with no sound but even that can get annoying
i've had to change my view on the worst film in the world having just seen this one this is no mistake this film is a list of storyline being based on a true story dreadful acting was judge reinhold thinking unbelieveably bad stunts childish dialogue non-existent continuity lack of the
would anyone really watch this rubbish if it didn't contain little children running around nude from a cinematic point of view it is probably one of the worst films i have encountered absolutely dire some perv woke up one day and thought i will make a film with little girls in and call it art stick them in countryside and there isn't any need for a story or explanation of how they got there or why they don't appear to live anywhere or have parents because films don't need anything like that i would comment on the rest of the film but i haven't ticked spoilers so i will just say avoid avoid avoid and find yourself a proper film to watch
i had high hopes for this film since it has charlton heston and jack palance but those hopes came crashing to earth in the first minutes or so palance was ridiculous not even acting or annabel beauty brief nude scenes could save this film some of the space effects were quite good but others were cheesy the plot was ludicrous even sci-fi fans should skip this one grade f
you should know that i am the type of person that watches even the worst of movies to the finish often out of sheer morbid curiosity i even watched leprechaun to the end before giving in to the temptation of tearing out my eyes and stamping on them you should also know that this movie was in my vcr for less than half an hour before i made a frantic leap for the stop button and dashed back the rental store just to put as much distance between me and it as possible
if you hit your head with a shovel write the script with your feet you may come close to the intelligence level of this movie there is nothing in this movie that hasn't been done a thousand times in other gangster flicks and done much better those who think scarface was some kind of hero to be looked up to or saw goodfellas menace ii society or dead presidents and thought mmm the life for me will like this movie i thought i'd give the movie a chance since the premise was perfect for a prequel i should have known better after seeing mario van peebles and sean combs were involved anyone above a grade education see the original with pacino a real actor and be satisfied
how many minutes does it take to paint a poem in this film much too long tells the story about the impact of a first love between two schoolboys boys can't withhold touching each other and making love after a while one gets distracted by a brief encounter with a sensual guy in the disco and that raises doubt exploration fantasy longing lust and feelings of loosing grip on your love are themes that are all extensively painted with music close-ups and silent scenes like telling a poem but it really takes too long annoying long shame the effort was promising
the female lead was a terrible actress which made the whole movie mediocre she was smiling too much when she first went in front of the cameras to talk about her daughter this should have made the police suspect her i would have been inconsolable in the identical situation she seemed way calm for a mother who could not find her daughter it was as if she did not want to even be in the movie jennifer aniston would have played the part better and it would have made a lot more money for such a controversial important subject everyone else was excellent i don't know where the lead actress is but i hope she got some acting lessons
it had all the clich√©s of movies of this type and no substance the plot went nowhere and at the end of the movie i felt like a sucker for watching it the production was good however the script and acting were b-movie quality the casting was poor because there were good actors mixed in with crumby actors the good actors didn't hold their own nor did they lift up the others movie is not worthy of more words but i will say more to meet the minimum requirement of ten lines james wood and cuba gooding jr play caricatures of themselves in other movies you are looking for mindless entertainment i still wouldn't recommend this movie
this movie couldn't decide what it wanted to be there were a couple of sub-plots that for awhile made you think these items would all come together in the end but they didn't if you want a alien in the frozen waste story stick with the version of the thing the abomination that was remade in gore-o-vision years couldn't get over the fact that the alien looked pretty much recycled from independence day bare minimum sets would have been more effective if they had hired actors who could actually act and carry off the intended of scenery chewing with little payoff
this video guide was the masterpiece of the year beautifully done matthew perry and jennifer aniston have major on-screen chemistry when they talk about what the start button does i'm waiting for microsoft to release a special edition dvd complete with deleted scenes bill gates commentary a documentary of how windows compares to windows xp and have won at least a golden globe
this is probably the worst excuse for television programming since oh i don't know whats happening now nothing ever happened on this ridiculous series even though mostly shot by britney and kevin themselves you don't get any good details into their personal lives mostly just them making stupid jokey small talk and acting like white trash look i love music as much as the next babe but this show is just pure filler for a nation so addicted to britney that they would watch her clip her toenails that could be an actual episode thank god these two broke up because they were painfully dull together this show is toxic
for the love of god please don't see this movie its a waste of time the plot is predictable as are the romantic scenes trying to build too much with very little this film and its evil predictable villain is just lame the characters aren't developed and most of the film is padded out with shots of rome which is much more interesting than the actual film to top all of that the acting is a disgrace i know everyone tries to find their niche but this is truly a disaster i can't believe that someone actually paid however many millions of pounds to put this film on screen don't waste money or time on this film go see your grandma or something worthwhile instead
i actually saw this movie at a theater as soon as i handed the cashier my money she said two words i had never heard at a theater before or since no refunds as soon as i heard those words i should have just waved bye-bye to my cash and gone home but no foolishly i went in and watched the movie this movie didn't make anyone in the theater laugh not even once not even inadvertantly mostly we sat there in stunned silence every ten minutes or so someone would yell this movie sucks the audience would applaud enthusiastically then sit there in stunned bored silence for another ten minutes
this only gets bashed because it stars david hasselhoff well then let me bash it to compared to the garbage they call horror coming out nowadays this film isn't too bad it has the beautiful leslie cumming she is super hot but can't talk very well there is a great scene with her when she is supernaturally raped she shows off her nice body linda blair does nothing here as well as hasselhoff
i gave this movie a and though i consider myself a science fiction fan i found this movie very difficult to take seriously it was on amc one late night and i'm glad i saw it for free this movie is probably good for a few laughs but not much special effects are about average for the time period not awful but not great either of course we know more about mars now than we did back then but we really can't hold that against this film the main reason i did not like this movie is because of the were several parts of this movie that i wish would have been explored in a little more detail the the city on mars the creature in the lake etc overall the movie is much like a lengthy episode of the version of the outer limits complete with a cheesy ending
a henchman wants to call her after falling in love with a five-dollar hooker in this extremely low-budget horror-comedy i can't explain all the positive comments on this movie i'll chalk it up to mass hallucination but disconcerting none the less the one redeeming factor this is me being extremely generous here might be the grandfather the only semi-likable character in this whole mess don't waste your money or time in fact a word of advice if troma puts it out on dvd but does not make it themselves in all likelihood dvd with omar and kirk second commentary with cast and crew deleted scenes bloopers troma interactivity radiation march clip from terror firmer theatrical trailer trailers for the rowdy girls teenage catgirls in heat cannible the musical and toxic avenger grade d
i'm a big fan of nicolas cage and i never thought he would work on a movie like this i couldn't believe the other reviews and i thought it shouldn't be bad to watch it at least trust me it haven't seen the old why would they want to remake a movie like this the very basic idea of a good horror movie is either it should have an extremely intelligent script or it should be extremely graphic this film doesn't fall under any of those and just remains just kept watching the movie hoping it would get interesting at some point but it never does this movie is a big no no for both horror movie fans as well as for the cage fans you could probably for it show up on television
the only reason i watched the movie till the end was the hope to see something interesting the movie is really bad and the performance of the girl it is really really bad honestly i am not a movie critic neither an expert but you just need common sense to notice that this work it is incredibly first thing that came to my mind as soon as she started to talk was she has an affair with willem dafoe and he accepted to help her with the screenplay and appear in her movie since she is the brilliant director surprise surprise next day after i watched the film i found out on internet that giada colagrande is his wife awful story and terrible performance
director ron atkins is certifiably insane this ultra-low budget film chronicles a few days in the life of one harry russo giancaspro who also co-wrote a nut-job who receives a rubberneck doll from his bitch girlfriend he starts to take orders from the doll to take massive amounts of drugs rape and kill not always in that order what starts off as being a balls-to-the-wall exploitation film well stays like that but it gets very repetitive very fast i'm leaning more toward the certifiably insane it is hard to forget once seen though kinda like if tom green ever did a horror candy laurie farwell gets fully nude jasmin putnam shows tits and bush candy seeing john completely naked repeatedly
what made the original killer tomatoes fun was it was made by people with no budget who were just being wacky for a couple of was something with a budget but it just wasn't as much fun john astin of adams family fame is actually making an effort here to be comedic but he is supported by lame actors cheap special effects and unfunny plot dr gangrene escapes from a french prison and decides he is going to put a pretender on the throne of france the hero his french girlfriend and the gizmo-like fuzzy tomato decide they are going to stop direct to video nonsense
just don't bother i thought i would see a movie with great supspense and it grows boring and terribly predictable after the interesting start in the middle of the film you have a little social drama and all tension is lost because it slows down the speed towards the end the it gets better but not really great i think the director took this movie just too serious in such a kind of a movie even if u don't care about the plot at least you want some nice action i nearly dozed off in the part of it rating
i was required to watch the movie for my work so i didn't pay for it the contrary i got paid but i still found the movie to suck far more than average the jokes were lame the two lead actresses well to use the first wives club division of ages in hollywood they are no longer in their hot chick age but more in their district attorney age what angered me most about the movie was the main plot line which pretty much completely plagiarized beavis butthead do america which the boys are all jazzed up about some dude offering them money to do his wife not realizing they're expected to assassinate her all in all a bland piece of crap
thanks to this film i now can answer the question what is the worst movie you have ever can't even think of a close second and i've seen some really bad nothing works in this film name a single element of any horror film and this movie fails honestly i've seen better on youtube some typical steve steve is that you steve i'm not kidding steve this isn't funny steve are you there steve steve ahhhhhh nooooooo
lets put it this way i actually get this movie i get what the was trying to do i understand that the dialog was meant to be dry and emotionless i understand that the plot was supposed to be non-climactic and stale that was what the was going for a very very very dry with all that understanding i still think the movie sucked it seemed like the was trying to recreate napolean dynamite with this movie it had all of the same features even the main character behaved similar to napolean but napolean dynamite was actually funny its script worked this movie is not it has no purpose well let me rephrase that its only purpose is to rip off napolean dynamite and try to capture that look and feel too bad it didn't work
holy cow what a piece of this movie is i didn't how these filmmakers could take a word book and turn it into a movie i guess they didn't know either i don't remember any farting or belching in the book do took this all times childrens classic added some farting belching and sexual inuindo and prostituted it into a kaka joke this should give you a good idea of what these hollywood producers think like i have to say visually it was interesting but the brilliant visual story is ruined by toilet humor you even think that kind of thing is funny i don't want the kids that i know to think it take your kids to see don't rent the dvd i hope the ghost of doctor suess ghost comes and haunts the people that made this movie
this movie could have been its got a somewhat fascinating premise but it never rises above sheer caricature the acting is severely flawed and there were moments where i cringed so severely that i thought i was going to fall of my seat in the theater never and i mean never watch this godawfull piece of danish cinema has been getting a lot of good pr the recent years but if this piece of crosses the border i'm afraid nobody sane will ever want to rent a danish movie this movie is the reason why i chose to register here i really felt i needed to steer people away from this piece of my sympathies go out to the people who already went to the cinema to watch this
this film is mediocre at best angie harmon is as funny as a bag of hammers her bitchy demeanor from law and order carries over in a failed attempt at comedy charlie sheen is the only one to come out unscathed in this horrible anti-comedy the only positive thing to come out of this mess is charlie and marriage hopefully that effort produces better results
this is the worst movie i have ever seen i was deceived into thinking it might be good because a couple of my favorite actors are in it now i want to punch jason schwartzman in the face for taking this role i was physically ill after watching this film i really don't understand hollywood sometimes there are so many people trying to break in that i'm sure you can skim off the top and get the very best that way the worst movie you make is equivalent to ferris beullar instead of this sludge the gags like the hair doll and blatantly ripping off jeans commercials added to the humorlessness of the film glad i avoided this film and watched it on tv this proves that you should avoid january releases at all cost
this third pokemon movie is too abstract for younger kids to follow and too repetitious to entertain older kids the message of the about dealing with is subverted by the return of the young father during the credits team rocket provide some amusement but they're not really part of the small plot so they don't appear very often
remember the chain-smoking channeler exposed on minutes a few years ago this is her lots of folks reviewed this movie without checking the bona fides of the filmmakers the producers have been using phony word of mouth promotions very successfully without disclosing the financial and philosophical underpinnings for this piece of marketing tripe if you believe in channeling reincarnation new age dreck and day-old baloney this film is for you if you want a discussion of quantum physics or reality look elsewhere the purpose of this movie is to convince you that ramtha isn't a wacko so you'll give her a bunch of your money if you can tiptoe through the ramtha website without howling in disbelief then maybe you'll think the bucks you dropped on this infomercial for insanity was well spent
i have been a fan of without a trace from the premier episode i really cannot express my disappointment in the episode last week this is a real problem that far too many afican-american families have dealt with and continue to deal with the lack of media coverage crucial in the first hours has been documented by a recent study law enforcement including local state and federal are also complicit what was the purpose of advertising this subject matter and then copping out on the ending seemingly television can deal with almost any subject matter except race this is it together or don't explore it next time
this is at least the third remake of this movie so if while watching it there is a sense of deja vu don't be surprised all they did was change the setting of the story and tell it differently but the differences are not significant and it doesn't get any better because the plot is flawed to begin with it never works and like its predecessors the acting is plot has a unique ending which will surprise any one who has never seen the movie before but the ending doesn't fit the story had this movie ended ten minutes earlier it would have worked and have been very satisfying and i would have thought it more worthwhile but here is the spoiler and that in the end crime does pay because the criminal is not caught i never like this message resulting from a movie
i too was fooled by the packaging i too fell for the gory packaging and the dvd casing that claims grieved fans as every copy was pulled from shelves though it was inexpensive it wasn't really all that worth it no scares and very limited gore the ending was very cheesy and didn't deliver the punch it should have i really don't even know how it became a video nasty with how very tame it is the story drags the characters are obvious amateur doesn't live up to the promise the dvd bonus feature very strange as the director appears very incoherent and not all there the lead actress talks like appearing in a shakespearean production a great laugh
lately they have been trying to hock this film late-night on cable tv commercials don't believe the hype i was one of the unlucky people to see this stinker in theatres this is in my opinion the worst movie of all time just behind mac me worst and jack frost worst but i must admit they are all close and all terrible really nothing of this movie is funny or disturbing or anything else it claims to be so don't waste your money the only thing it is good for is giving to your worst enemy i'm not lying about that someone who you would love to kill or torture would be a prime candidate for this film it is that awful if you don't believe me then you deserve to suffer through the misery of watching this which i doubt you can finish two thumbs enthusiastically down
a poor film but i must give it to the lead actress in this forbes she appeared to be acting the least and i personally thought she was kind of cute too bad she only appears in one other film in the database besides that the film is filled with laughable gore and fakey death scenes people get stabbed and they gush like gallons of blood but if you like to watch poor horror films i recommend this one highly
please even if you are in the worst of the moods refrain from watching this flick don't think whether anything was right with this movie at all on a recommendation i watched this and i literally flushed and min of my life down the closet poor acting stupid direction weak storyline and pathetic action sequences and when you blend this together you get double impact even least of the expectations were not met guess i did learn one thing never watch van damme action flicks they are pure wastage of time
it makes sense to me that this film is getting raves from hollywood because oftentimes in hollywood all just a popularity contest it also makes sense when you think that people who are liking the film may just be reacting to the countless songs being spit out at you rather than story content yet this film is overrated and overblown eddie murphy looks just ridiculous no way do jeniffer hudson and beyonce knowles give the oscar rated performance so many have raved over before the film was even out i can't even believe that condon is being set up to be nominated for a directing oscar when all he did was put together an album glitz does not replace a nothing storyline a bunch of songs does not a movie make
the worst movie i have seen since tera jadoo chal gaya there is no story no humor no nothing the action sequences seem more like a series of haphazard akshay kumar thumbs-up advertisements stitched together heavily influenced from the matrix and kung-fu hustle but very poorly did not go a lot of expectations but watching this movie is an exasperating experience which makes you wonder what were these guys only thing you might remember after watching it is an anorexic kareena in a reason why i did not give a rating of is that every time i think i have seen the worst bollywood proves me wrong
such great actors such a disappointment marlon brando plays and awful character the movie is not funny at all a subconscious message can be seen it is a damn crap it suucks so badly throw your tv through window and so on it is simply disgusting and irksome in addition to foolish plot sense of humor there is something else the way the rooms are decorated the colors it makes me sick everything is so colourful that it might cause epilepsy usually i do not care about the decoration in movie but this from free money made me angry avoid at all costs free money probably for charlie sheen sutherland and brando but a viewer gets nothing one watches it at cost of sanity
oh dear while chevy chase and the gang at snl set new highs with the sketch show format this fails miserably at every level fortunately chevy is barely in this at all and can't be blamed for this utter tripe it seriously is very very bad while meant to be a political comment on usa at the time of release it still remains neither funny or acutely observed the sketches are all way too long and any satirical impact they may have had is lost as they're all drawn out to the point of complete boredom this is credited as movie debut and i'm pleased to say that everything he did after this bettered it avoid even if curious
flat characters that you do not and never will care about cringe-inducing dialogue at places no twists think they have one but if you didn't figure it out after about you're not too bright lots of well know actors in roles and performances that fortunately for everyone involved will be forgotten as soon as the end credits don't mind slow movies but they've got to be going this one plot wasn't what made this a direct-to-dvd movie just a rather convenient excuse to try and drum up some fake as-of-writing ten ratings must be from people involved with the production
finally i thought someone is going to do justice to classic not another version set in the wrong locale or era but one based firmly on the book well it definitely follows the book pretty closely and that is the only plus to this is hours long the book is only around pages timothy hines had the nerve to come on here and say if you can do any better i would say yes i could and i have never used a video camera or been to any sort or drama school in my paid good money to get this crap over to the uk from the usa do not make the same mistake as me
bridges of madison county is a better made version of this story i felt the ending of this movie was not handled sensitively as they did in the original english movie this movie is very indianised if you are a very sensitive person who cries in a movie when hero dies in the end you'll love this movie on the other hand if you are a fighter in life and think crying is for wimps you may not like the on the whole pretty good subject is well handled for indian conditions tabu was good as a caring wife and mother everybody acted well
columbo movies have been going downhill for years this year it may have reached the bottom peter falk gives the same uninspired performance and comes over as creepy in this movie as is usual in this series crime scene protocols are unheard of so plausibility is always lacking brenda vaccaro chews the scenery and pulls pantomime faces and andrew stephens is a pretty unconvincing man faint though was a script was by the numbers and its delivery patronising they should never have brought columbo into the nineties just left us all with one or two happy memories of clever plots better scripts and sharp characterisations
the cast is ok the script is awkward at times and it takes a while to figure out what the point of the movie is i found myself looking forward to doing the dishes the shehan bit is a cheesy statement on the war i guess we were supposed to not notice did its a house you did nothing more than kill forty five minutes the shower what was that about literally it is i have a client ok you can use our shower yawn the angles are trying way to hard there was a set of woods suddenly its gone cause you can see right through then next it is deep and animals are dying in the end this is a horrendous movie of boring proportions
this film looked interesting i'd read the book a number of years ago and it informed me that the feature followed the plot outline pretty watching it and almost from the outset it failed to live up to expectations in fact i didn't bother watching the whole thing utter drivel bad performances bad acting and instantly dislikeable characters that was the point of the film i this film left a bad taste in the mouth and put me on a downer for the remainder of my not bother with this feature
wow i love and respect pretty much anything that david lynch has done however this movie is akin to a first attempt at making a pseudo art video give you a couple of examples david lynch is typically a visual filmmaker however this had little visual artistic content walls up shots with ceiling in the background david lynch typically takes great pride in audio however in this you could even hear the video hum fact it is very hard to swallow the idea that he had anything to do with this movie is a joke on part to force fans search his website hours only to find this drivel i hope so because at least that idea is funny
i heard about this film and knew it wasn't real good but i started watching the film my was interested this could be a really great darkly black satire on todays morals in media the small featurettes on every contestent were good it build up to something i wouldn't wanna miss but when the so called show starts everything becomes implausible cheap and rather silly where the writer should have added something that would make people think but instead wrapped up and assuming people are this ending is so bad i give it a even if the film starts of promising
this has to be the cheapest film made in century it is all the way low quality but at the end it falls below everything all the cheap tricks like flashing and darkness are used to hide those crappy computer the actors are below average especially the main character anne fletcher mackinnon there is a scene where anne is asked why you seem so careless the correct answer is because she can't act no matter what happens world is about to be destroyed her friend is dying she is fired she has the same stupid grin in her is not only the movie which is b it is also the back cover description least in finland the text mentions things like lorica gray capital and main character garrison harper and anna anne fletcher the description sounds like a different movie both featuring character called fletcher and sea monsters
after i got done watching this movie i was so upset that i had wasted hours of my life hours i'll never get back ugh when you start this you might think wow this is really good but rest assured that first impressions mean nothing i was so excited about this movie until the dumbest ending i have ever seen this movie is simply pathetic the acting is bland the story line is anything but original and nothing especially unique about this except that the worst movie ever do not watch this movie warning dumbest movie ever you will be sorry if you waste hours of your life on this
this movie was so very badly written the characters had no depth they should have never made a movie of this my yr old son could write a better screenplay then hyung-rae only actor that didn't suck was the zoo guard he was the only funny and believable one of the love movies and try to give them the benefit of the doubt but this one was up there on my lame list at number number being those of you who actually thought this was a good movie you are in serious need of brain of the creatures in the movie weren't even why did they call d-war
hey is playing the elvira late night horror show on their site and this movie is their under the name monsteroid good fun to watch elvira comment on this crappy movie have fun with bad movies anyways this movie really has very little value other than to see how bad the were for horror flicks bad effects bad dialog just bad movie making avoid this unless you want to laugh at it while you are at hulu check out the other movies that are their right now there is episodes and some are pretty decent movies with good plots and production and you can watch a lot of them in as long as you have a decent speed connection
i should have figured that any movie with the poltergeist lady in it isn't going to be good it actually starts out okay but during the first murder scene you find out that the movie you're watching is a movie inside of a movie people sitting in a movie theatre watching that movie one girl in the audience is so annoying that i would have turned around and strangled her a bit strange but far from good
leonard maltin compared this film to a mel brooks comedy he was far too kind to ms rivers and far too cruel to mr brooks not even the raunchiest mel brooks films are this tasteless and at least they're genuinely funny this picture deserves a place on the hundred-worst list
i didn't think it would be possible for joe don baker to make a movie as bad as his stinkbomb mitchell but this one wouldn't recommend this if you're a fan of joe don much better work you like to watch fat guys sweat and really really drawn out gun fights you'll love this movie
really am truly amazed to see the glowing reviews here is one of the worst movies i have ever seen it is one big pathetic grainy clich√© i would have laughed out loud and a lot but was on a date with an ex-military guy i could not hide my other response boredom yes i think my date a flat-line good old boy liked it not a compliment i know an actor wants to work fine for the others but ralph come was a painful tease from ralph i vote a only because ralph looked so stunning but i must plead ralph how could you and why going to go watch the end of the affair to heal and recover now
i would rather of had my eyes gouged out with rusty ice picks than have had to sit through this abortion there is no plot there is no acting ability ray liota has shamed himself and should be blacklisted from any more work i am so sorry that the industry allows crap like this to be shown on any type of medium has it that maddona threw herself to the floor to break her other arm so she could be taken away on a stretcher actullly she deserves to be married to this loser and wanna-be-actor-director i hope she stays in london and never returns to the usa please do not waste your money on this so called film i beg of you
i own this movie not by choice i do i was really bored the other day and the box intrigued me so i popped it in the old vcr and spent the next hour and a half of my life crying why god why the story-line was not that bad as an gamer i could appreciate bits of it i think that maybe if you're into super geeky-cheese romantic scenes you'll enjoy this film i always thought of myself as a vulcan you know like to love there is very few good things to say about this film truly it is awful but if you're up to really badly made film this is the one for you the real much more interesting though i had to sum up this film in one word it would
this film is just a kids against evil genre thunderbirds is just the hook to get people to see it but are almost incidental in use the fact that the action takes place on tracy island is just a ploy to pull in the public it was interesting to note what the film makers view of future london will be and how the world all fits best part of this film are some of the lines delivered by lady penelope which are highly comical these provided some light relief for those expecting a rerun of the tv said that it passes or so minutes in a fun way and so may just be worth watching
the concept for sarafina appears to be a sound one that is aside from the musical perspective it attempts to combine upbeat african music with a story describing the atrocious conditions and atmosphere that black people were forced to endure at the time the film was set the contradictions of each of the two elements are too glaring and the film never justifies such rapid shifts between jubilation and terror had it simply been a drama reflecting these conditions it may have been a good film however the scenes of school children being shot down by soldiers don't exactly sit well next to the songs from the poor premise the acting isn't the best either goldberg gives a mediocre performance as does the remainder of the cast overall a
plenty to appreciate here spectacular locations and flying sequences period costumes props and sets and competent writing and acting however to enjoy a drama we need at least one principal who exhibits some qualities that we can like or admire in this bunch of catty snobs we found only one character who is at all likable a hapless enlisted man in a fleeting peripheral role as their helpless victim from the reviews here it is clear that we are completely out of step but we did not find their malicious-schoolgirl behavior amusing or entertaining even the dog is detestable we threw in the towel after two of the six episodes so you should discount these observations accordingly but what i could find written about this mini-series gave us no cause to expect character transformation or redemption
i can't figure out how anyone can get a budget for a movie this bad like the tv station are desperate for anything anything at all they're buried underneath a bunch of snow the electricity constantly flashes on and off yet magically there is a background light that stays constant where does all this light come from that and all that stupid bickering between the characters they seem to be more interested in complaining to each other than trying to invent ways to survive it tries to create that feel of emergency and people helping but because such bad directing and acting you will not your florence nightingale fix with this flick sorry i'm joining the negative feedback and i concur that this is one of the worst movies ever
i'll just be vague about my potential spoiling comments there are enough canned plot elements in this movie that essentially movie derives a few ideas from a southern classic to kill a mockingbird i suppose maybe tkom got its ideas from some source at any rate after you watch this you'll say oh yeah that is a think the truly entertaining thing about these mcmovies is once you've identified a plot element is to figure out whether they'll stick with the original or try to twist it around not a lot of twists in this one
perhaps one of the most overrated so-called horror classics ever made halloween does feature the memorable michael myers and some great acting by jamie lee its rewatchability factor is very close to zero as there is an unforgivable amount of time spent on to the actual is the sort of movie you can walk away from to microwave popcorn and not miss anything at it spawned so many sequels i will never god rob zombie is remaking this and generally i hate he will more than compensate for all the random time-filling gaps with some quirky points of interest that the original severely is a movie we feel we have to like much like the way we're taught that we should enjoy assume this is a classic
i've read a few books about bonnie and clyde and this is definitely more accurate than the version in that its costumes and locales echo actual photographs taken of the gang particularly well done is the death of buck barrow and the capture of his wife blanche this actress looks looks exactly like the photographs taken that day of blanche grieving over her dying husband however this movie is still hollywood and our anti-heroes stay pretty to the end even after being shot full of holes life bonnie was badly burned in an auto accident the year before their famous ambush and did not look like a perky cheerleader at the time of her death the script is tedious and the acting is poor particularly the leads very disappointing stick with beatty and dunaway may not be the true story but a great film
pokemon the movie was a terrible film unlike the first one this is not a good film at all the graphics were decent but the story was flat and no real drama was built up in it in the first one the interaction between the characters were decent the subtraction of brock and addition of tracey was bad tracey really doesn't have much to say or do and unlike brock offers no comic relief the only good points is you get to see misty actually get jelous over ash and her early brooding over being called his girlfriend was entertaining overall this film isn't worth renting and the short movie before didn't do anything for me or my wife and we do consider ourselves pokemon well maybe the next one will be ge t much worse
okay the promos promised a comedy and went to watch it being the first release of is not a bad thing or for that matter of any year because the first and last films mostly flop except ghajini and some coming to jawani in short the film is about emraan hashmi doing his usual stuff sadly annoying this time after repetitions it has an irritating hrishita bhatt and a flop celina dialogues comedy scenes and badly handled drama and lots of is bad emraan hashmi is annoying here luckily now he is coming of age but post footpath and murder and some decent work in some more films the actor in him took a backseat and directors focused on his kisses and womaniser image which sadly lost touch after repetitions hrishita and celina are bad mahesh is horrible
i couldn't believe my eyes once i've watched this movie no point in it either then blood and violence unlike other scary movies that had gore and a meaning to it this movie is just blood gore and killing one after another this movie isn't interesting at all has no meaningful plot or story line nor does it have an intelligence in it the blood looks very fake and this movie overall is pointless don't even waste your time with it just an hour or two of mindless violence it has many bloody scenes that aren't scary but just plain revolting this is probably the worst horror film i have ever watched out of all the horror films i ever saw
i can't believe that those praising this movie herein aren't thinking of some other film i was prepared for the possibility that this would be awful but the script lack thereof makes for a film also pointless on the plus side the general level of craft on the part of the actors and technical crew is quite competent but when you've got a ear to work with you can't make a silk purse ben g fans should stick with just about any other movie been in dorothy s fans should stick to galaxina peter b fans should stick to last picture show and target fans of cheap laughs at the expense of those who seem to be asking for it should stick to peter amazingly awful book killing of the unicorn
one of the worst movies i've ever seen with robert de niro the fan is a pointless clich√© of an exercise in slasher flicks it tries to spin or twist the genre with preposterous plot lines of a a crazed fan turned psychotic the movie meanders into nothing we're to believe that a knife-wielding idiot has access to and murders a baseball player in a lavish hotel with no witness security or cameras the movie is nonsense trying to tug at our heart-strings through the hoopla of baseball ending up mockingly unsophisticated and gimmicky not sure what all the actors were thinking when they got onboard this razzie this is as big a dud as they come stay far away if you prefer thought in your movies
i completely agree with this was the single most horrible movie i have ever seen holy crap it was terrible i was warned not to see foolishly i watched it anyway about minutes into the painful experience i completely gave up on watching the sat through until the to see if i could well i did and now i wish i had was happened and the ending was all movie that bad has the right to implore all of you to spare yourself the terror of fatty drives the only i had heeded the same save yourself from this have a feeling those who rated it highly were involved in the making of the should all be wiped off the face of the planet
to be honest i didn't like executive decision which was obvious the template very much but compared to this piece of crap it looks like a masterpiece of only that the people moving in the film term actors would be an insult for all other actors should attend more acting classes the guy who build the setting hasn't even seen an aircraft from afar it is so ridiculous that on a only flight attendance are aboard but this is only the tip of the iceberg the film is full of illogicalness use sleeping-gas then don't use it then use it anyway which dropped my rating finally to the can have more fun in rearranging you sock drawer or in drilling a hole in your knee and fill it with milk
i rented this tape a couple of years ago and boy did it suck from the commercials i was lead to believe that this was a movie about a guy who had no no luck with women and that was where the comedy would lie boy was i wrong the jokes were vulgar and they were just not funny don't bother
absolutely trash i liked halloween and from then on been in a downward spiral this is about the pits we get it john pro-lifers are scary you don't have to make a shitty film that bores the hell out of me to tell pacing is way off here it feels like john didn't have much to work with here to his credit it looks like he did not write this junk there are countless times where the camera just sits and waits for the actors to look dumb or say something dumb i love the long cut too bad carpenter doesn't know how to employ it he needs to bunk up with herzog and fassbinder years ago please john stop making a fool of yourself and boring me to death
this sequel is thoroughly uneven incoherent and rambling in plot there really is tries too damned hard to be modern out of period and character st century style songs predominate and cute there are too many manufactured belaboured jokes with animals the actors in his film are secondary to the juvenile plot even glenn close she is normally very good sweeps through this film parodying herself as the original de ville and the lead from sunset boulevard a film that isn't even good to look at this is a very good example of a bad and pointless sequel even basic instinct had a plot characterisation and acceptable acting this doesn't it is bad
first of all let me say that i had to think a lot about writing a comment for this movie the best review for this kind of cinema can be just the silence movie addressed to housewives and to grandmothers this movie tries to look genuine and the characters should be supposed real people an italian could never think that the characters might be real they are just low-profile stereotypes it gives a very misguised vision of what life is in the italian countryside the plot is weak which plot and the humour does not make laugh anyone older than
this will be brief let me first state that i'm agnostic and not exactly crazy about xtians especially xtian fanatics however this documentary had a tone of the like of some teenager angry at his xtian mother for not letting him play video games i just couldn't take it seriously mentioning how charlesmanson thought he was christ to illustrate the point that xtianity can breed evil i don't know it was just cheap and childish made the opposition look ignorant furthermore the narrator just seemed snobby and pretentious the delivery was complete overkill i can't take this documentary seriously might appeal to an angry teenager off at his xtian mother for not letting him play video games
i rented this flick for one reason tom savini i respect his work but this was a real let down i had horrible clich√©s half of the film was naked women so called fallen angels running around trying to act scary oh and then there was the occasional blair witch black and white motion sicken camera scenes character was really awful horrible script and you got to love these lines they use is anyone there who is out there this isn't funny no but your acting was i wish i could give this flick a oh the names of the characters judd molly ally emilio but they did leave out anthony the breakfast club reunite in the forest of unforgivable acting
i felt that the movie was dry very disappointing no waited for something to happened and nothing did dry as a bone a wast of money one of robins williams worst you don't believe me wait a few months it will be out on dvd because that seems to be a pattern for movies that don't do well in the theaters are out as rentals before the year is over this is one you will not want to see or say why did i spend my money on that plus for it being such a new movie there were only people in the watching it this was on a friday night the showing i also felt that it needed some more excitement or something to keep us awake when they characters spoke in the movie the voices were also very low you could not hear what they were saying
fake the whole thing is a fake there is no ghosts or zombies alan is a lord and his cousin or brother or half brother or something like that wants the castle and his title for himself so he invests this overly complicated and needless pointless plan ala scooby-doo to drive alan to commit suicide most of the movie is him picking up redheads and attacking them not even killing them he drops off to sleep and the girl vanishes and he thinks he buried them someplace if he looked at the so-called ghost of evelyn he could tell she was wearing gloves my god what a waste of time don't bother watching it renting and if you bought it and haven't watched it yet sell it quickly do yourself a favor and stay away from the night evelyn came out of the grave i give this stinker the crap-o-lantern
what can i say about seven i watched on a flight from seattle to tokyo and as that flight was long and boring the movie definitely didn't help will character ben thomas is almost completely unlikable even with his redemption in the end the two hour plus run time wastes most of the screen time with random garbage that just strings the plot along as slow as possible in the movies defense rosario character adds a little life to the film although not much i don't understand how anyone could actually cry during this film when all i wanted to do was turn it off also will smith kills himself with a jellyfish at the ended proving that killing yourself with a jellyfish is the stupidest way to die
much as we all love al pacino it was painful to see him in this movie a publicity hack at the grubby ending of what seems to have once been a distinguished and idealistic career pacino plays his part looking like an unmade bed and assaulting everyone with a totally bogus and inconsistent southern plot spools out this way and that with so many loose ends and improbabilities that the mind reels then basinger is there not doing much her scenes with pacino are flat and unconvincing hard to believe they meant a lot to each other no energy leone on the other hand lit up the screen she was electric and her scenes with pacino were by far the most interesting in the movie but not enough to save al from embarrassment
bette davis brings her full trunk of tics to this miserable flop which is another variation on the hilariously mismatched lovers theme sadly cagney and davis are truly mismatched in acting styles and the mix is not simply unpalatable but distasteful the only distinction in the film comes from eugene pallette who literally phones in his usual part as the misunderstood dad jack performance can only be described as an act of mayhem on the audience
having seen three other versions of the same film i am afraid for me this is by far the weakest primarily due to rather dull and leaden performance his emotions throughout are so bland it makes it difficult to engage in the film alistair sim portrayed the role infinitely better when scrooge was at his meanest you don't get the sense scott is saying the dialogue with much conviction and when he undergoes his metamorphosis he is similarly unconvincing i cannot think of any actors in this film who match those from the alistair sim version even the musical version frankly the muppets take on this are better executed very disappointing
despite pretty bad reviews i just had to give this film a go it does after all star hk super-babe shu qi plus other oriental lovelies as a team of all-action cat-burglars surely worth checking out well as babe-fests go martial angels is hard to beat the eye candy is top quality shu qi looks as fantastic as always and of the rest of the girls rosemary vandebrouck and amanda strang caught my roving eye in if one is to judge this movie by any other possible merits it is an absolute stinker the story is weak the action shoddy and the special effects downright pathetic director clarence fok and producer wong jing have given us a photogenic cast and little shu qi is the only reason you're contemplating seeing this one you would be better off watching sex and zen again
this film is in no way entertainment but more of a look deep into the depths of the darkest side of human behaviour loosely linking a half a dozen stories of the worst kind of depravities perverted sex greed violence and intolerance all the action is played out over a few very hot and sticky days during a heatwave in vienna and the heat is maybe responsible for some of the anger and hate in the film for me the treatment of the retarded girl by the security equipment salesman was about the worst episode closely followed by the scenes of drunkenness and perversity in the slags flat you will be gripped and i hope horrified by this film i hated it but i felt compelled to see it through for fun for displaying man as he sometimes is
hmm imdb rating of good comments bla bla okay two of my friends and me we orderd pizza sat down and wanted to see something as cool as ichi or at least something brainless but funny like versus but naked blood sucked a complete waste okay the scene with the woman who likes to eat is quite outstanding but it nothing more nothing less i won't summerize the plot other people did already i just wanted to stop the hype but watch it and rate for yourself maybe we can push the rating where it sould be one more thing that comes to my mind the soundtrack is even worse than carpenter ever was okay cool
i just did not enjoy this film but then i loved babe a pig in the city and have been spoiled by talking animal films that are exceptionally well done in every way the animals were not likeable they were all irritating especially chris guinea pig but then what could i expect chris rock i believe i smiled once or twice at a couple cute lines but it
maiden voyage is just that i'd like to say straight away that i watched of this before i just couldn't stand it anymore as already stated in another comment this film doesn't fall into the whole so bad good thing just bad the acting is awful the sfx are poor and the story is bland and stupid even the extras suck the bag guy guards and such appear to hold their weapons like water even bother watching this film the only thing special about it is that no matter how low your expectations are you will still be disappointed
tara reid as an intellectual christian great as a dollar store constantine and stephen dorff stephen dorff for christ sake i personally just want to thank those brilliant casting directors for the hard work and effort you guys are on heres an idea just my humble lowly opinion as the movie going public but it follows directly with your previous movie about the most brilliant neuro-physicist in history invent one pill to cure all diseases ever known to man and get this heres the clincher they have to be played by jessica simpson and paris hilton i knew you guys would love that seriously though you owe me
i really didn't like this film the plot was very predictable typical american plot i'm sorry guy gets the girl kind of thing at the end and london has a monorail bank of london bank of england is what it really is i did however like the look of tracy island and the thunderbirds themselves and the brits were baddies from parker and lady penelope what was up with that oh and they kept on saying stuff like here come the thunderbirds but it was never known as the thunderbirds in the series why do that i'd like to see this re-made in years with more british cast i preferred the original series sorry
one wonders how the script came to be and the other performers do an ok job but as it is neither comedy romantic thriller or anything else it is all rather feels as if one of the threads had been pursued it could have been something worthwhile it is nonetheless interesting to see a real turkey of a story made just before the usa became directly involved with the war i wonder if the surrounding politics had something to do with trying to make a movie for all tastes but ending up with something that pleases no it has historical value
apparently the people that wrote the back of the box did not bother to watch this so-called movie they described blindingly choreographed intrigue and violence i saw no intrigue i instead saw a miserable attempt at dialogue in a supposed kung fu movie i saw no violence at least i saw nothing which could cause me to suspend my disbelief as to what could possibly hurt a man with impervious here i am perhaps revealing too much of the plot furthermore as a viewer of many and sundry films of which include the occasional kung fu movie i can authoritatively say that this piece of celluloid is unwatchable whatever you may choose to do i will always jonathan tanner i was not blinded by the choreography
lady in cement pi spoof with ole blue sinatra is a shamus on a houseboat in miami in this rarely funny by an annoying and repetitious hugo montenegro score and bunch of misfiring punchlines this flick just never rises above slightly too bawdy to be on tv made for television movie blocker is effective in the mike de corsia big galoot role and raquel welch should thank her personal only thing that makes the dvd worth keeping or seeing is the collection of cheesy trailers for welch flicks like voyage mother jugs speed and myra if you get the dvd-skip the predictable movie and go for the trailer library in the special tons of mysoginistic asides-sinatra lisps the homosexual owners of the local go-go relic that needs to be put back in the time capsule d
i saw the film and i got screwed because the film was foolish and boring i thought ram gopal varma will justify his work but unfortunately he failed and the whole film got spoiled and they spoiled sholay the cast and crew was bad the whole theater slept while watching the movie some people ran away in the middle amithab acting is poor i thought this movie will be greatest hit of the year but this film will be the greatest flop of the nobody did justice to their work including ajay devagan this film don't deserve any audiences i bet that this film will flop this movie sucks
with title like this you know you get pretty much lot of junk acting bad script bad director bad grammar make lot of noise that really not music and lot of people yell movie make bad racial stereotype why come every movie with black hero have drug addict why come hero always have to dance to be success why come famous rapper always have to be in dance movie why come letter s can't be in need to stop dumb down audience and make movie that have people with brain who know how speak proper self favor and not go see
what a waste this movie could have really been something decent but the writing in particular is crap and the main characters are rather shallow and uninteresting mike meyers was good and the historical recreation of late decadence was well crafted but overall this movie was a big waste of time instead the movie to watch that deals with similar themes and the same basic time frame is the great boogie nights
ok look at the title of this title says it all right the title is great i mean a lot of things should come into your head after readin it in fact you might be extremely anxious to see sadly you won't see any of a bunch of bad actors some blood spilling some hot chicks and some lesbo well i think there are about minutes of zombies and vampires away from this if you want to see a good movie else get it
scary yes scary jam-packed with nudity fat people to skinny people maslin beach takes place on a nudist beach in first saw this film two years ago safe to say it made a bizarre topic of discussion at school the next day this film was horrible hardly a romantic comedy just a showcase of nudity this movie hit its lowpoint with one of the new-age characters staring down between a girls you're not going to find god in there guy nah but i think i found clear of this one unless you want to hear amateur actors discuss topics such as farting adultery and the process of superlguing genitals together avoid
prior to watching dahmer i thought no movie could be worse than freddy got fingered i was wrong to sum dahmer up a story about a gay serial killer which features almost no killing and almost entirely consists of encounters with gay men before they were killed there is no plot to be found and it serves no purpose as far as telling us anything about dahmer all you'll learn about dahmer from watching this movie is that he liked to have sex with men horrible acting horrible directing horrible writing horrible everything if you have to choose between watching dahmer and projectile vomiting for three hours go with the vomiting it wll be less painful
it was nice to see all the familiar characters again but the story bothered me we loved ariel in the first so why is the second one centered around her daughter the new characters were annoying and i didn't like the plot of this worst of all christopher daniel barnes didn't come back as the voice of eric disney please stop remaking classic movies with these shoddy imitations
in my life i have seen many great and awful movies i am not an expert in professional reviews but i have definitely something to say about this one firstly these actors are the worst i have seen their acting is so unreal that you even want to throw away the dvd in the first minutes i think that these actors were not interested in the quality awful thing is about these dialogs they are so lame you sometimes feel uncomfortable when you hear them it seems that your year old son could act better i feel that this movie had a budget similar to the cost of my year old european if my message reaches you save your time and money
whoever made this movie must have done it as a joke i mean this was the stupidest movie i think i have ever seen a killer snowman terrorizes a small town give me a break love it when he takes off driving the cop car more like a comedy than a horror movie if you want a laugh rent this if you truly want a horror movie stay the hell away from this one
sorry but aside from kim basinger doing a good job acting scared this was one of the worst thrillers i've seen in awhile logic is thrown out as young guys terrorize this woman outside a crowded mall then shoot a security guard yet no one seems to notice then instead of screaming for help or racing back to the mall she drives off and ends up in the middle of the woods with the guys in hot pursuit i can't even describe how silly it is seeing this woman fleeing from retarded thugs carrying a red toolbox screaming for god to come help her and then having sex with one of them after brutally killing the others please trust me this is bad and a bit tasteless as well
this must be accompanied by a special rating and warning not recommended to normal obsession of daneliuc with the most dirty body functions becomes here a real nightmare also evident that the man is a misanthrope he hates everybody his country his people his actors his job and this hatred makes him blind and he forgets anymore the profession he knew long so called film is just a hideous string of disgusting images with no artistic value and no professionist knowledge it is an insult to good taste and to good sense shame shame shame
i just saw this at the vancouver international film festival the synopsis in the festival guide sounded pretty good so we decided to check this one out i'm sorry to say i was very being poorly written it was boring i won't take away from the actors as there is not much they could do with this bad bite was clich√© without being ironic over the top seriousness without being funny the movie would have been better had hunt hoe went with a campy horror feel instead he took himself to seriously and this resulted with a boring film i can't recommend this film it felt too long and all in all just plain weak
have previously enjoyed wesley snipes in several action flicks and i had expected a lot more even from a score of imdb the movie fails to entertain and even though the story is thin and unoriginal the acting is most unfortunately thinner and goes to mimic a worst case scenario of playing strong feelings accompanied by some bad acting don't waist your time this movie √≠snt entertaining if you wanna cry it might suffice though even though your tears will be wept due to seeing wesley snipes in the tragic action film wannabe give this it really was awful if you wanna see a decent movie go see shooter or rent it its all the good things this movie isn't
i don't really post comments but wanted to make sure to warn people off this film an unfinished student film with no redeeming features whatsoever on a technical level completely amateur constant unintentional jump edits within scenes dubbing wildly off etc the plot is completely clich√©d the structure is laughable and the acting is embarrassing i don't want to be too harsh i've made my share of student films and they were all awful but no reason for this film to be out in the world where innocent fans will have to see assumption that much like the cast positive comments are filmmakers friends and family
this film just goes around in circles and the viewer does not know where they are at first i could be kinda cool movie this but it just drags on and on and eventually you don't know going on the lead female is a good actress and played her role well and the psycho fella is creepy but after a bit you don't really care what happens because this film just drags on shame really this could have turned out a lot say though that the lead female and psycho fella will have a good career ahead of them but will they remember this film for making them known or for being the film they regret they ever made
i went to this movie expecting a concise movie relating the effect the son of sam had on the society i didn't expect spike lee to force-feed me more garbage on racial tension mob-justice or the inability of the common citizen to make a choice under pressure by peers lee has presented an extreme entire movie could have been more effective if in a format with more focus less tangential even bother renting the video unless you passionately enjoy spike lee in such a case the theatre is worth it this is not an escapist movie
anyone who has studied any physics or cognitive science will walk out disgusted after min as my wife and i did the ignorant masses might be entertained by the hand-waiving arguments and the absurd conclusions drawn even an attempt at a logical reason from real science i'm offended by such nonsense presented under the guise of science i can only conclude that the writers picked up a quantum physics book didn't understand a word of it then watched the matrix about a thousand times and proceeded to write this example the washington dc crime experiment was done by the transcendental meditation program a brief search will reveal the science of their methods your money
this film seems to be a rip off of many movies that have dealt with the same subject in the past let the future viewer be forewarned that art heist doesn't add anything to the genre director bryan goeres has no clue what to do with the baldwin keeps reappearing in films and frankly one wonders if he has a great agent or is it that directors and producers love his unusual goofy looks complimented by that strange hairdo he sports in most of his movies the only good movie in which he has appeared is the squid and the whale in which he only speaks two or three lines ellen pompeo his leading lady doesn't fare much better there is no chemistry between ms pompeo and mr movie to be seen at the own risk
if you want to know the real story of the wendigo i suggest you pick up a copy of algernon original story this movie was not only bad but had nothing to do with the loved the book when i read it as a kid campfire chillers by was so excited to see a movie based on it come out i was so disappointed when i finally saw it another thing is that there were too many pc correct undertones throughout the movie that had no place in the film when the book was written pc didn't even suggestion is don't waste your time or money if you see it on the video store shelf leave it there
and thats about all that is this thing is slow the actors have ability they just don't seem motivated to put forth the effort the plot isn't that great and is hampered further by the aforementioned slowness of it all the accents when there are any are british uh lots of these folks are supposed to be danes ok ok accents aren't that important but language is i don't think they used words like yeah and ok in day and that supposedly way cool weapon his king gave him did he ever reload that thing did he ever sight it in or was beowulf just that bad an aim well his aim did at least match the computer graphics used in generating the monsters those were rather off too bad special effects bright spot just one that i can think of marina sirtis has held up well over the years
considering that i felt like picking up a new jet li film to see some but kicking and brainless hand to hand fighting i grabbed this this movie contains more gun battles chow yun fat but nowhere near as good than jet li and acrobatic fighting thus it was a let faucet fighting was interesting and even funny considering this was something totaly unexpected in a jet li film for me more on the line of say jackie alas i'd recommend fist of legend tai chi master or even the enforcer over this for martial arts rating for overall movie score
i was eager to see mr fix it because i'm a huge david boreanaz fan what i got though was a hour nap the premise seemed enjoyable boreanaz is lance valenteen proprietor of a business called mr fix it where dumped men enlist his help to get their girlfriends to take them the problems with this movie are the editing script and acting although i've found boreanaz delightful in his other film roles the exception of that crow movie he did this was disappointing at times his character was interesting and others flat the supporting cast reminded me of soap opera day players i realize it wasn't a big-budget film but some of the scene cuts and music just didn't seem advice watch at your own risk
horrible horrible horrible do not waste your money to rent this movie its like a low budget made for tv canadian movie absolutely the worst movie i have ever seen and there have been many others out there this movie is not worth the time it takes to put it in the dvd player or vcr is it possible to write ten lines the acting was horrific it had absolutely no flow i saw the made for tv movie on the btk killer and it was much comparison to this one i am not sure what they were going for in producing this film but if it was to educate us or tell a story about the btk killer they missed by a mile it appeared to be more of a infomercial for animal rights
now wrong with the actors that took part in that crap michael dorn should stick to the star treck merchandise john diehl does anyone remember him in miami vice liked him there well whatever what can one expect from a movie with one of the lifeguards from baywatch in the lead nothing and what we get none of the characters is even likable the special effects are hilarious not funny the story is a bad joke there is no logic whatsoever for happening i got the feeling that the film makers were trying some kind of attack of the killer tomatoes kind of thing especially in the scene where all the important people were discussing national security in some kind of a you happen to see it on tv switch channels your tv set will be ever thankful
i expected alot from this movie kinda like lee as a naustradamous like caracter but instead all i got was a waste of time and a boring movie i can't even explain this movie it had wooden acting terrible script from pieces from the bible like hurricanes tidal waves and earthquakes but that was at the end the rest of it i had to wait and hope that something meaningfull would happen but it didn't this movie is about a couple that tries to find out the changes going on in the world like places in china where there was an earthquake and end up at a convent run by eight nuns and a priest the convent end up being the key to the misshappenings the whole movie is missleading and boring one of lees worst
i'm shocked that there were people who liked this saw it at tribeca and most of the audience laughed through it at scenes that were not meant to be funny i felt bad because the lead actress was in the audience but honestly the plot to this movie needed major didn't even make sense one second the characters question what exactly it is that they're next scene they're hopelessly addicted and figure out how to make it also the ending just took the not going to spoil the magnificent it pretty much blended right in with the rest of the horrible this movie for comedy if you must
this whirling movie looks more like a combination of music-clips at mtv than as a real movie there is no real story and as the movie goes on you ask yourself what is going to happen but nothing happens the story around eric cloeck the frustrated writer is the only good thing the other persons seem to have nothing in common then why bring them together in a movie with music you can make watchable the worst movie when i open the tap and there comes water out with the music of bach then most people will like to look at it but this is not a movie the director should learn how to write a script for a movie of minutes or more before starting to direct a movie
this piece of crap since i can't call it a movie can be summed up by the black criminal with black midget partner get in trouble midget pretends to be a baby with a fully developed adult face body hair and genitalia midget is by man and woman who happen to want a baby midget than goes on to commit acts of physical and sexual violence demean white people wherever he sees them and commit more crimes it could have been a good satire if it hadn't been directed so shallowly and had such talentless bastards star in it
obviously made to show famous stripper misty ayers acting talents too bad she can't little tale about sweet innocent sally down being drugged and forced into white slavery then she meets likable tommy cole who instantly falls in love with her he wants to help her escape but can he you really won't no real skin just strips down slowly to her underwear the rest is just a boring little tale chockful of bad acting atrocious comedy thought prostitution was funny but what do i know and terrible post-dubbed dialogue i admit there was a twist at the end i didn't see coming but not enough to sit through this also ayers attempts at acting are hysterical a real bomb avoid
a trio of treasure hunters is searching the west indies for a hidden fortune the lure of gold makes for a rise in tension as the men come closer to the location the deep-sea divers hope to track down the gold but find that greed and hatred leads to murder according to the dvd synopsis manfish is the name of their boat not a monster the skeleton who gives muscular captain john bromfield brannigan his half of the treasure map is very good old salt victor jory professor provides the other half of the map first mate lon chaney jr swede plays dumb and sexy tessa prendergast alita guards the rum very well obviously serious editing and continuity problems mar the picture which otherwise might have amounted to manfish w lee wilder john bromfield victor jory lon chaney jr
i was so eager to see this one of my favorite tv saw universal trademark followed with a newly acquainted title and theme song which still impress animation on some scenery like a solid title jetsons or a dimension view of a spaceship approaching an amusement park and more made this version splendid and after that till the couldn't believe my lucky i was that i could forget all i had songs by tiffany and its theme song in new arrangement were in my wish to see this space-aged family the flintstones and yogi bear in all graphic computer design as toy story or best style for in my opinion
i was interested to see the move thinking that it might be a diamond in the rough but the only thing i found was bad writing horrible directing shot sequences do not flow even though the director might say that that is what he is going for it looks very uninspired and immature the editing could have been done by anyone with vcrs and the stock was low budget video i would say that it wasn't even something as simple as mini digital video are some simple ways to fix a film with what the director has like through editing etc but it is obvious that he just doesn't care there is as much effort put in to this movie as a ham sandwich it could be made better but that would mean extra work
why because for one reason there has never been a more adorable scene in any film than ann margret singing bye bye birdie at the opening she reprises it again at the ending too a different mood both wonderful rent it and see even if all of it that you watch you'll agree i'm about the original was so excellent it just didn't need a remake sorry jason and vanessa gave commendable performances as well as tyne and chynna in fact all the actors and singers in this new version were giving their all but like trying to improve on casablanca it just can't be done even annoying finding yourself comparing the two mentally as you try to appreciate the remake and it just falls short through no fault of the actors
another friday the ripoff even featuring some of its music a group of young adults get together for a small high school reunion and start getting slaughtered a la jason voorhees could it be that nerd they used to torment in slash-fest is fun for fans of the genre and contains the usual quota for films if its ilk the ending is a bit more imaginative than your standard rated for language sexuality nudity and some drug content
this may be the worst film adaptation of a broadway musical ever even the music has been destroyed attenborough knows nothing about theater almost every shot and moment ring false i will say though that it is almost bad enough to be hairstyles are remarkably dated i can not for the life of me understand what is meant by opening the film with an exterior of the theater where a chorus line is playing are we to think that these people are auditioning for a chorus line which contains the stories about the people who are auditioning oh no the show is collapsing on saw the original production and have listened to the album hundreds of times why oh why did they do this
as we all know hollywood enjoys changing historical events around for our enjoyment and minutes is one of those hollywoodized movies for example the bank robbers never did go back in the bank when they started shooting at the lapd yet in the movie we see them go back inside twice another example is the number of lapd officers who were shot near the end of the movie this is far from the truth but of course hollywood must have a good bloody ending so they some more blood and guts some events were combined and many of the lead actors played several different people but this is what hollywood has always done so why complain i guess the only sad part is that i have watched some one hour documentaries about the north hollywood shootout on tlc that were far better then this
the king maker is a film about a series of real needed events that occurred during the portuguese occupation in the costumes and art direction are commendable the movie still fails to impress the viewer the acting in particular was extremely poor some of the actors are trying hard to let tears down and the accents both real and fake are extremely irritating the storyline was also too dumb and too stupid to be true and it seemed more like a history lesson the movie couldn't even capture that sort of regal and century-old air and it looked more like a botched attempt to make an asian version of say costumes and art direction give the film a breath of fresh air but the execution was extremely poor and the actors couldn't even give natural bursts of emotion in short the movie sounded more like hullabaloo than a script
this movie is a blatant attempt by the left in hollywood to portray administration as incompetent and bungling some mistakes may have been made at the time of the crisis but i'm sure not to the extent portrayed in this lame movie my first reaction was that this movie had to have been directed by oliver stone but i was wrong this time there are apparently many others
the alarmist is so abysmally scripted that you have think to yourself why on earth did an up and coming actor like david arquette agree to be in it it has to be one of the weakest plots i have ever seen and without any humour at all it borders on the brink of tedious it staggers along to a dreadful conclusion which appears to only happen because the director got bored and just wanted to wrap up quickly in order to get home for his dinner stay away
i found the arab conspiracy in a bargain bin and thought i'd uncovered a lost treasure folks a reason why you don't hear much about this film the plot is muddy the pacing is slow cornelia sharpe is about as vivacious as plain cold tofu and the ending leaves you flat not even sean connery can save this one
as soon as it hits a screen it destroys all intelligent life forms around but on behalf of its producers i must say it doesn't fall into any known movie category it deserves a brand new denomination of its own a neurological drama it saddens and depresses every single neuron inside a the closest thing one will ever get to a stroke without actually suffering one it drives you speechless all you members go numb your mouth falls open and remains so and the most strange symptom of all is that you get yourself wishing to go blind and small feat for such a sort of a only word that comes to my mind just having finished my ordeal is outrage
how did mike hammer live in a penthouse with a golf bag stashed in the corner next to a big screen cathode ray tube tv and a snazzy fireplace nah he'd knock back a bottle of rye and twenty unfiltered camels on the couch or floor of his fly-specked office or in the stink of a lousy downtown la flop house wiping the dried red crust and oil smeared mud off his face how spillane wrote trash paperbacks for sure but how do you make it worse give some desperate scheming producer a blank check because he thinks any film noir titled crap will sell at the box office add some over-the-hill hot tomatoes and just generally screw-up the story-line by some retard drugged out screen writer how
not surprised that even cowgirls get the blues if this movie is anything to go by i expected something better from uma thurman which was the reason i suffered my way through this experience in the first place an awful film with only the music as a redeeming quality just a shame that we are incapable of giving out of in these reviews this movie deserves it
i really don't understand all these positive user reviews this movie is the worst movie i've ever seen and i'm not trying to be mendez is hot but terrible in this film but i don't think it is her own fault but the directors he have somehow managed to make everything look artificial their acting the idea the make-up star i'm giving is only for the idea behind the movie which was very bad watch this bullshit go watch a fellini woody allen or some david lynch
story starts slow and nothing funny happens for a while all the action is in the end but you won't have to laugh because the movie is funny but because the story is funniest part is when harvey i'm not paranoia keitel really loses it and the judge starts a massacre oscars for this guy
this piece of crap might have been acclaimed years ago but it is one of the most racist movies ever made with the native american indians played by white men the right-wing republican james stewart was a huge racist in real life just like his close friend john wayne in stewart had actor hal williams fired from the jimmy stewart show short-lived series that mercifully flopped just because williams was black as if that were not bad enough this film is very dated and boring watch dances with wolves instead for a less racist was in his forties when this awful movie was made and even with his ridiculous wig he still looked like a paedophile chasing after debra paget i'm surprised it was even
the only reason to give this movie even a single star is how much the ending made me laugh i had high hopes as i usually love bad campy holiday horror movies but this just didn't qualify really just a bad attempt at showing a character slide slowly into insanity which again isn't a bad plot but is done poorly here there are some scenes as the ending which are not intended to be funny but actually made me laugh out loud there were a couple of times when i thought the movie would actually go in an interesting direction but it never fulfills what it could and should be in my opinion if you are looking for a christmas slasher flick try silent night deadly night
no real plot to this one just a series of short skits acting out some very old jokes i chuckled once or twice in the beginning much to my chagrin but even at only minutes this film wears out welcome before too long and becomes stale and tedious some nudity sprinkled in here and there to keep you awake still as bad as this movie is pretty putrid a comedic gem compared to pretty much anything by aaron seltzer jason friedberg movie epic movie meet the spartans also the song is sadly kind of catchy in a sad candy pair of tits bushes asses grade d red dvd extras original trailer for this film and trailers for beyond the door dead pit the farmer obsessed ones power play sole survivor wacky taxi
i had to do a search on the actresses to find the board of this film because the title is now an unexpected love not really worth looking for but i was unfamiliar with both leads and wondered why they were headlining a lesbian flick on lifetime pretty restrained and you don't really get an idea of who these characters are so as a viewer i wasn't able to become emotionally invested in the storyline i guess i'm not the target audience for this but i'm not sure who is muted and soft focus and earth very interesting i had a prurient interest in seeing two women make out but handled so discreetly that i was disappointed rent personal best instead
this is a copy of the doris day classic romance on the high story line is more or less same but is contemporary govinda plays a sharp witted fellow who replaces the husband on the trip while rani plays the college friend of the wife who does her the same favour they ostensibly try to catch each other out while the actual husband and wife tries to trip each other in the trip govinda mistakes another girl for wife and spies on her while falling in love with the ravishing plays a dual role of father and son both lawyers specialising in divorce proceedings they are pitted against each other for the warring is a poor attempt at copying the original classics and the songs are quite appalling the comedy is slap-stick and will not make one laugh too much
i think they really let the quality of the dvd production get away from them i rented this dvd from movie stores and the second time i finally got it to play on the dvd player i else have this issue really hard to give the film an un-biased review after going through such a hassle to play it for one i've never seen a finnish horror film before so i was sort of bummed that the movie was done in english also since never made clear what is wrong with sarah she just came off as retarded and therefore i really just hoped someone would shoot her in the face and make all the horrific happenings go away
in the tower of babel installment of the mini-series the narrator describes the builders of the tower as the descendants of like saying george washington lived many centuries before alexander the that the light bulb was invented before the that the guided missile was the forerunner of the i say writers of the greatest heroes of the bible should have at least paid closer attention to the chronologies of biblical people and events
this movie seems to send the wrong message there can be morality without using christ poeple of other religions i believe can get into heaven i am a catholic who goes to church every week but i do not agree with such christian arrogance this is the worst time travel movie i have ever seen and i've seen timeline
to not live in montana and especially not to live there at the end of the river runs through it certainly is a well made movie from a cineastic stand-point great landscapes redford acting the story is bad there is a story at felt sorry for the narrator author who is as dry narrow-minded a character as his father a preacher being driven not driving his own life he is left to watch his brother who is also caged in the small town environment losing his life the author never even comes close to undestand his motivations but at least realizes that he is lacking the slightest amount of homour fun all there is is fly-fishing where he follows even as an old man the style of his end is not surprising it is forseeable from the very not a must-see
i usually enjoy films like this shot documentary style but the acting and writing are just awful the acting is wooden and stiff and the writing is just so clich√© but not at all in a good way as of typing this i'm surprised at a on imdb i'm certain that most of these votes must have come from relatives of people in the movie i suppose if the case you might manage a couple of laughs as always funny seeing your make a movie well in a way i guess this gives hope to all up and coming writers directors actors etc cause if they can do it you can do it although maybe you shouldn't
some news reporters and their military escorts try to tell the truth about a epidemic of zombies despite the government controlling the media the makings of the film don't understand that the george romero zombie films only worked because he kept his politics subtly in the background of most of his films of the dead withstanding this satire is about as subtle as a brick to the face or a bullet to the head is more apropos for this scenario subversive or subtle about seeing a military guy masturbating to death and destruction anything nuanced about the various commercials that are inter-cut with the film nope furthermore the acting is uniformly horrible the characters thoroughly unlikable and the plot inane add this all up and you have the worst most incompetent zombie film since reared hideous grade d
an intriguing premise of hand-drawn fantasy come to life in a fever dreams however i imagine the average nonfictional child is far more adept at scaring themselves than bernard rose is at riveting the viewer the duel between two realities drags on far too long to sustain interest especially considering that the little girl playing her is the most abrasive child actor i've ever only for kindling
what a muddled mess i saw this with a friend a while ago and we both consider ourselves open-minded to the many wonders of cinema but this sure isn't one of there very well could be some good and there are certainly some good performances the circumstances it is all buried under random nonsense sir anthony draws way too heavily from the same gene pool as natural born killers u turn and similar films as far as the editing is concerned or maybe he watched himself in nixon for inspiration say what you want about david lynch but at least he more often than not has a method to the quote of stating that he made the film as a joke says it all not worth your money bandwidth or time
it seems like more consideration has gone into the imdb reviews of this film than went into the a review without when you think nothing is going to happen it it up any way you like this is a dull film full of unengaging characters doing very little of to put on if you want to convince an impressionable emo chick that you're like so deep something to watch for your own pleasure
this was a great book and the possibilities for a truly great film were definitely there but the casting decisions completely wrecked the movie hanks is a great actor to be sure but lacks the smarmy morally ambivalent characteristics needed for the lead role jeff daniels would have been my melanie griffiths in for eye candy reasons is understandable but again she did not portray the depth or ambivalence so need to pull this movie is a great example of how every decision even those early on in the movie production can make or break a file
i chose this movie by the cover which was a bad move it wasn't funny at all and the main characters were obnoxious the girl was beautiful but the story and the acting were terrible it had absolutely nothing to do with surfing terrible movie with a surf theme that had nothing to do with surfing and no real surfers catherine zeta jones was beautiful and the movie will probably see a resurgence just becuase she is in the limelight now being married with gordon gekko and all but if you haven't seen it don't waste your time a bad movie with great surfing real surfers and amazing beautiful cinematography was in hands
how many times do we have to see bad horror movies with a killer in a scream-ripoff mask the plot of bleed is kinda original but the movie itself is a complete failure for one thing the dialogue is poorly developed boring and wastes too much time on trivial details the acting is bad et cetera i want my money back this rental stinks worse than a skunk
gods i haven't watched a movie this awful in a long while maybe not since the new guy or various freddie prinze jr movies yes it is that astoundingly awful mira blank and wooden acting surely must've been inspired by freddie the movie staging was awkward a play rather and that feeling of confinement does not work well on film the actors had no idea what they were doing especially sorvino her accent was awful and her sex appeal non-existent here so it was painful to see her seducing other characters and they falling for it and what was with the occaisional shots of a live audience in lawn chairs nonsensical i had to turn the dvd player off it would have been self-inflicted pain to finish this film
bela lugosi is an evil botanist who sends brides poisoned orchids on their wedding day steals the body in his fake and takes it home for his midget assistant to extract the glandular juices in order to keep wife eternally young some second rate actors playing detectives try to solve the terrible terrible mystery bela lugosi hams it up nicely but you can tell he needed the money film is thoroughly awful and most of the actors would have been better off sticking to waiting tables but the plot is wonderfully ridiculous tell anyone what happens in it and they tend to laugh quite a lot and demand to see the film i got the dvd in a discount store for which i think is a pretty accurate valuation anyone paying more for this would be out of their mind
you know you are in trouble watching a comedy when the only amusing parts in it are from the animal cast it is a pity then that the parrot cat dog were only in support not the other way around as the humans in it were pretty abysmal i were you paul eva lake sort of name is that jason lindsay i would forget this acting lark do something else as all of you are as funny as watching paint dry awful actors to main gag in the film is one of the characters shouting me not gay which is funny as if you weren't you might change your mind if you had to put up with the three bossy tedious dare i say very plain women leads in the worst film i have seen in years hopefully never see one as bad again though i expect not
i saw this move several years ago at the central florida film festival if i recall i liked it it showed great potential i guess most people here are blasting this film because the film did seem hobbled together the own admission on the official site the short was exhibited as a nonetheless it was an easy-going comedy i think many people try to read far too much into a comedy all they are supposed to do is make you laugh all i did just that at its showing so it succeeded on that level just my cents anyway
i usually talk a bit about the plot in the first part of my review but in this film really not much to talk of just a mish-mash of other far better sword sorcery epics lack of cohesiveness runs rampant as does banality even the main villaness refusing to wear clothing other then a loincloth is pretty boring as she pretty much has a chest of a young amusing in ineptitude at best and severely retarded at worst lucio fulci was scrapping the bottom of the barrel here and it grade extras posters stills galleries lucio fulci bio and us international theatrical trailers candy sabrina siani is topless throughout may consider that appealing i did not various extras are topless as well
i'm a big fan of the tv series largo winch this movie was pain for me i had to use fast forward not to fell to sleep it was boring how can somebody ruin this title so much the story was the only good thing actors were they can't live the role the main is a null watch the other roles of this actor the fighting scenes were unbelievable boring and not to they were not to follow the situation like other reviewer said low budget film with bad next time somebody else can do better thing out of this title french can't do right thing with big alien that was bit brrr after alien
i can't understand all the hype about this movie ok if you like cheap splatter you will love this movie but if you like good stories and good actors don't watch this personally i really disliked the actors in this movie they seem to be hired straight from the street the dialogs are completely flat and you always know coming up next the overall quality of this movie lacks of the supposable very low budget when we saw this movie and other people we all had in mind that this movie was made by some people who needed to do this just to get their graduation at a film school with the lowest effort another issue that really lessens the whole experience is the bad cam shaking and the bad sound the whole movie seems to be recored with a single microphone
i saw this by chance showing on cable on wanted to like it as i thought sandra was quite funny from what i remembered the only facial movement i had throughout the movie was jaw dropping stunned at how awful a movie i just suffered person who said this is one of the funniest movies of all time please point out one line just one scene that is even worth a is a much better singer than i remember her to be but i didn't want to watch a lounge think this is a movie try hard to like since they think they should and don't view it objectively
a movie has rarely left me as cold as this one there is not a bit of tension not a second of fear not a moment we jump even a little bit the girl is cute yeah it was that worth a movie i knew it wasn't supposed to be a great movie but i was at least expecting one
this is a horrible movie all three stories are bracketed with a psychiatrist hypnotist line which is unnecessary and all the stories are bad the first is about wild wolves and some lady there are some things that don't make sense but the hypnotism thing makes up for that the second one with bad bill paxton as a maniac roommate should not be viewed by anyone the last one sadly the best is almost incomprehensible which i guess makes it better than the other garbage
i will never forget the night i saw this movie we were on a submarine on patrol in the north atlantic and this was the scheduled movie of the evening we all gave up after the second reel they did not even try to show it at the mid-night showing opting for a rerun instead this is all i really have to say but they have this stupid rule that my comment must contain ten lines i'm not supposed to pad the comment with random words so i will just continue to ramble until i get my ten lines of bs i could not find george goble listed in the credits but i remember him in the movie the sining was terrible and the songs even worse
i never actually thought that a film could be so atrocious but alas i was wrong terrible acting terrible plot terrible effects the crocodile was awful and as for the stupid scene all in one that was a bad move from the word go it was truly shocking and that is not a compliment how can someone make this film watch it back and then actually say yeah thats a good movie people will watch that if you haven't seen it i beg you don't bother
this film was a waste of time even rented on dvd if super-speedy camera shots get any faster than this we might as well pay twenty bucks to get in the laundromat get popcorn and watch the dryer spin jet li is so much better than this one can only hope that he won't be making deals anytime soon to make another cliche-ridden film like the one film you should avoid this is the one
i grew up watching and loving tng i just recently finished watching the entire series st voyager on dvd which may have heightened my sense of disgust with this episode as the difference in style and approach between the two shows couldn't be more stark the idea may have been good if used as an opportunity to further expand character which is how it probably would have been treated on voy they could have featured memories that would be new to the audience rather than simply regurgitating old show clips the in and out transitions between the memories and the present in this episode start as clich√© in the beginning and very quickly become intolerable as the tired pattern wears on and on bar worst episode ever
if you are expecting to see a lot in the bath of as it is promised by the tag line you will be very disappointed to see that the movie consists of nothing but the populist style of regarding most famous issues like sex marriage and cheating to much nudity which seems to appear from nowhere and has no connection or whatsoever to the plot proves that was unsuccessfully to try something new as he has quoted to much sex centered jokes seems to show that had fallen for the famous saying which is sex sells i was hoping to see a very good story told with a very good narration technique however in the end i found myself sitting down for minutes and watching experimental yet still to much focused on popularism work
and being let down bigger than ever before i won't make any direct references or anything here but to say the least this film is pathetic if you're military trained don't bother watching i put it on the dvd with friends wanting to watch a somewhat interesting action war flick why couldn't i just have read the reviews at the first bomb scene the film has huge glitches and they continue to show and become bigger and bigger my friends not connected to the military in any way spotted a couple of the mistakes almost as fast as i myself did and asked me if some of the things going on we're realistic well as you might have guessed they're not at this movie unless you're able to overlook these completely idiotic and re-occurring mistakes being made for catching my interest at first
i can't believe it that was the worst movie i have ever seen in my life i laughed a couple of times probably because of how stupid it was if someone paid me to see that movie again i wouldn't the plot was so horrible it made no sense and the acting was so bad that i couldn't even tell if they were trying that movie was terrible rating f
anemic comedy-drama an unhappy seemingly rushed affair featuring cher as a woebegone housewife who slowly makes friends with the hit-man been hired to kill her by her husband chazz palminteri as the talkative hired gun adapted the screenplay from his own play with stagy set-ups and back-and-forth dialogue that quickly tires the eye and ear an air of gloom hangs over the entire project and director paul mazursky can't get cher out of her perpetual funk listless despite all the top talent robert de niro as one of the producers faithful is fraudulent with no substance to the story and characters who rarely come to life from
i was thrilled to watch this movie expecting it to be the sequel to the cult classic private lessons which portrays the dream of any male lessons ii has nothing to do with the title i mention just a regular soft-core cinemax flick that won't make a change in your life just one hot sex scene in a rooftop but it i watched this a long time ago but believe me this is just a regular boring soft core women are hot but not enough to rent or buy the movie my advice is to watch this only if it airs on cable
when i was a kid i remember watching this while visiting a friend of our uncle phil we're back a story is a silly cartoon about a dinosaur called rex by the wonderful john goodman he tells a little boy dinosaur the story about how the dinosaurs came back to earth to live he explains that he was part of the thing that brought them back along with some friends the villain of this film i think might have been responsible for them being them back but i don't care about him the kids might like this but personally it is just too cheesy john goodman was probably the only decent thing poor
kris kristofferson at his drugged-out peak in the finds himself barely able to squeeze on to the screen alongside la humongous ego and discount-store of the characters are really likable i was glad when ferrari went over that hill and you want to see a good movie about rock and roll stardom try buddy holly only about a year and a half after this dreck
i don't know what this movie is about really like a art school project they never say why the world is dark but it is always darkness except for seconds a day there are long interrupting shots of insects of all sorts for no reason what little dialogue there is in the movie is as inane and nonsensical as the images a black woman enters the main apartment somehow she becomes pregnant overnight then gets shot in the head the main character takes care of the body until it becomes a cocoon after which a white naked woman emerges i have never been so blown away by how bad and pointless a movie can be honestly i would like someone to watch it so they can tell me what they think about but i wouldn't wish this level of hell on anybody else
i watched this film for minutes and counted mullets a mullet every minutes seriously though this film is living proof that formula works if it ain't broke it don't need fixin a streetwise-yet-vulnerable heroine a hardened ex-cop martial arts master with a heart of gold and a serial killer with issues pure magic
let me first say i watched this movie around midnight and usually there only is trash around this hour but this movie broke the of all the main character is an old non attractive creepy guy yet he gets to all girls that come on his path for example he goes to a shop talks to a girl and then you see them there are loads of sex scenes and in many of them there is no nudity at all i would not have been surprised if one of the characters in the movie would say fast put your clothes on so we can this movie should show what a sexual addiction can do to a man or a family this movie only shows soft bad acted erotica it makes me wonder why those actors agreed to play in such trash
the story by norman maclean is a masterwork film is a mediocrity he adds banal scenes of the maclean brothers going over a falls and of them double-dating in a seedy bar that were not even hinted at in the story the cipher brad pitt trying to play the charismatic paul maclean a genius outdoors proves either risible or depressing depending on what the original story meant to you some of the fly casting scenes are beautiful also tom skerritt as the father and craig sheffer as norman are strong and masculine as men were once expected to be none of the women make an impression in the film which is regrettable because maclean loved the women in his story and made this clear even poetic
this is the kind of movie so extremely bad that you cant stop watching it because you keep telling yourself that it cannot continue to be this crappy all the way to the end it just cant you know worse than jaws of honestly think i've only seen one movie that was worse than this and then we're talking religious crap about how you'd end up in hell for lying or watching indeed and lots of it well made gore no acting is beyond bad and all the lines are lousy clich√©s same goes for the storyline which only really consist of sex blood and violence like so many other gore you're hoping for a mix between ichi the killer and august underground keep looking you wont find it in live feed
i don't think any movie of van will ever beat universal soldier but u never know this movie was good but not as good as vd returns a luc must do battle again he tries b funny here but its maybe worth a smirk of a chuckle vd has a kid this time from ally w good it showed a pic of them goldberg was cool he does his famous move-forgot what its called cause i don't watch wrestling-sucks vd goldberg had some good fights it was the ending like the but just not that good vd does his best move in his career like always-the helicopter kick even though the final ending should've been longer anyway it is worth seeing but it will never top the original
germans think smirking is funny like americans think mumbling is sexy and that women with english accents are acting i had to cross my eyes whenever the screen was filled yet again with a giant close-up of a smirking face one of those housewife hacks corporate mainframe tales where she defrauds a bank by tapping a few random keys on her home pc which is connected only to a power socket the director obviously loves the rather large leading lady can't say i share his feelings quite a funny bit when the entire family sit in front of the television chanting tonelessly along with the adverts apparently this review needs to be one line longer so here it is
this was the worst movie i have ever seen and i've seen a lot of bad movies first of i'm from kansas this movie does not have a shred of truth in it at all its like they took btk name and made up the rest on top of that it looks like someone was like i've only got bucks here take it and make a movie and oh yeah don't worry about researching btk at all just make up something seriously pure dookie no one should ever see this movie the slaughtering cows scenes and making his victims eat stuff and describing animal slaughter btk did none of these things but the movie does so for the love of god never see this god awful movie the made for tv ones are way better and way more accurate
before seeing this movie i would've said that i loved everything kathy bates has done now everything-minus-one james woods is his character his acting someone should've told him that poor is not synonymous with dirty nor ignorant nor cliche ditto for randy stereotyping the only redeeming feature is henry thomas who isn't a strong enough actor to carry this sodden mess if you enjoy the country you'll enjoy the scenery the best i can give a serious fan of both independent and quirky films but this is simply terrible
formula flick of guy who wants girl guy who will lie to get next to girl guy who will get best friend to help in outrageous way reliefus no to help deceive girl etc this been done to death and with rare exception of a few z-rated outings been done plot aside the leads are attractive and a couple of good moments jonathon schaech has done better and his acting here came close to being phoned in not a complete loss but nothing new here in this tepid affair
a movie that makes you want to throw yourself on a sword i've seen schlock in my time but after viewing the wretched mess i don't think i can ever watch a another movie again may god pity the souls who made ex-army quiet stud underwear model type character acted actually goes looking for the girl who sent him a xmas card while serving in the military lands in with her cabin living-granola type family who are right-wing loggers family takes to him and it takes hours of our time for the chick to see a better catch than her liberal looking french wine drinking porsche driving loud cell phone talking lazy city slicking jewish looking characters themes being beat over the head with the pro-military theme ed commercial breaks were long peter jason it ended
the ringmaster stars jerry springer as a tv talkshow host called jerry but not the jerry springer show his guests are trailer trash but not the trailer trash you get on the jerry springer show they attack one another but not like is the point of making a movie about the jerry springer show and pretending not the jerry springer show and on top of that this is a very boring film
this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen in the cinema could not wait for it to end to make matters worse it is given a certificate so you do not see anyone getting shot just bodies slumping to the ground even babban getting killed was cut out too many scenes were cut to bring in the younger viewers as i think the makers knew it would flop disastrously amitabhs acting was great but that basanti wannabe and the other idiot who plays devgans mate can't even act devgan was would not watch this for free again and i advise all others who read this to do just the same you have been warned
this movie was extremely boring it should least not more than minutes the images of child and animal being killed were little bit i don't write comments but this one was so bad having so many good and excellent comments i think in this case we are one step closer to honest assessment of this more can i say i fall asleep during this movie times it was about hours after i had woken up from hours long sleeping period i think it is the point is no dialog between characters except maybe sentences at the very you fall asleep once watching it do not try to rewind and catch up because you will fall asleep again
i am a youth wife and we took some youth to see this film we then spent an hour trying to explain it to them they didn't get it and i didn't enjoy it it is based on a concept that has run through all three of the major religions of the world bible code the torah code and the code in the koran and is so questionable as to be laughable this is not a step forward for christians in the arts it is a step forward for those who believe we check our brains at the door
i couldn't believe it when i put this movie in my dvd player i thought i'd have a good laugh since i've played for half my life i had to turn it off as i had company and they were wondering what the crap i was it later and i should have just left it off at the soft-core gay clown porn in the beginning no they run the gamut of fart jokes cum jokes incest racism dressing up as kkk this movie is flat out mean to anyone ever played wonder it looks like the real wouldn't let them use their game who'd want their name attached to this
if i could say it was better than gymkata i at least felt my money was not totally i saw steven on deadly movie should see a resurrection though on mst if santa claus conquers the martians could make tom head explode one wonders what mayhem this movie could is a very good reason why kurt thomas never had a movie writers of this dreck should be forced to wear placards every day of their lives that say bitch slap me i was a writer on gymkata
i like silent films but this was a little too moronic as much as i wish i could say that it was worth the hour i stood up i can't i don't think any version of the movie even comes close to the book and don't try it out on kids they might freak and the lady who played pollyanna how old was she i know the labor laws were different back then but come on people
this is just a bad movie with what seemed to be quite a nice budget it had potential to be much better it almost were with the heroine beautiful almost like salma hayek hero fighting almost like jackie chan battles and duels almost like in crouching tiger music almost like in say conan etc almost but in the end just dull and it is hard to find anything interesting in it maybe apart of john rhys-davies flying in duel like those warriors in hero or before-mentioned crouching tiger i am really ashamed of poor old john he is after all quite a good actor and deserves much better so as you so if you still have a chance just watch something else
well jesus of montreal is basically an intelligent movie the actors are indeed good and the technical side of the movie is okay but although i was very interested in the topic and like to think and discuss about religion am an atheist it was hard to force myself to watch the movie to the bitter and in my opinion somehow unconsciously funny end why is this movie so incredibly boring i don't know it just is and so it is not recommendable
if you appreciate the renaissance in asian horror don't bother with gawi the film scarcely deserves mention alongside a-list work such as ringu a tale of two sisters cure and ju-on even such good material as the eye or inner senses those films brim with subtleties unexpected imagery rich characters and a decidedly non-western take on frightening gawi is strung together with the leftover limbs and organs of everything that has made american horror lousy for the past twenty-five film tries to blend asian ghost story and hollywood slasher flick but a bad fit one aesthetic is bound to smother the other guess which having no story of their own to tell the filmmakers loot ringu for an evil-child subplot but the situation is hopeless clich√©s crap characters witless plotting a dull ghost ho hum
dakota was another early lou diamond phillips starring vehicle this film is similar to the later released film harley there are a few differences but they're both the same i don't know which one came first i guess it'll remain one of the mysteries of life but they both are troubled kids who are trying to turn there lives around instead of bikes this one involves horses they're basically the same movie and they're both cheesy as hell if you're a serious fan then i recommend that you watch them both you get some extreme mugging and posturing from if you're game then go for recommended except for fans
actually had to stop it don't get me wrong love bad monster movies but this one was way too boring regardless of the suspenseful music that never leads you anywhere the actress had too many teeth and that moment when she makes contact with one of the beasts was way too obvious a clich√© this film totally betrays the cover on the dvd which looks pretty interesting from the cover one expects a giant monster but you get these cute not as gigantic as expected electric eels moved on to watch another film called the killer rats but another review deep shock was really crap a big shame considering the fact that it looks pretty high budget
i can't believe the positive reviews of this movie i thought it was one of the worst most poorly executed and poorly acted movies i have ever seen and the plot was completely ludicrous she starts making out with him while tied to the chair puh-lease the worst part was that it wasn't even bad in a good laughable way just plain terrible i couldn't figure out why they even bothered to show it on hbo i thought belushi was ridiculously silly very unbelievable as an eccentric hit man idk i could go on again i am shocked by the positive reviews the only thing that kept me watching it is that fascinating to see how a movie can go wrong and what makes it bad and the ending didn't disappoint in its silliness either live by the sword die by the sword ridiculous
yikes it was definitely one of those sleepless nights where i surfed the channels and bumped into this stinker of a movie for some of the names in the cast i'd expect a much better movie i'm almost embarrassed to see oscar winner f murray abraham being reduced to such a horrible part i hope the money was worth it and the students they talked about fencing like they were talking about survival in a war or through a horrible disaster i mean i've fenced a fun sport but i've never been that intense the only reason i even watched this entire movie was because the remote fell under the sofa and i was too lazy to get it back
this is a candidate for the single most disappointing movie experience of my lifetime cool title excellent director saw to die for and drugstore cowboy before this and hey uma thurman in the cast how can you go wrong well that is a question that throbbed in my temples for hours after i watched this and unfunny in an attempt to be offbeat this is a dead-zone of a movie that should be avoided at all costs its critical lambasting was well deserved you have here one of those rare films that does not contain a single redeeming quality zero out of
do we really need any more narcissistic garbage on the baby boomer generation technically i am a boomer though at the time when all the idealistic youths of the were reading marx burning their draft cards and generally prolonging a war which destroyed tens of thousands of lives i was still in grade school but i remember them well and out of were just moronic fools who would believe anything as long as it was is just another excercise in self-importance from the kids who never really grew up
guy is a loser can't get girls needs to build up is picked on by stronger more successful guys etc seen it saw it moved on i'd have to say that rob needs to move past the adam sandler part of his life and get out of the adam sandler plots there are two funny parts in the whole movie i couldn't even finish the last minutes i was getting bored the animal is an alright film i do usually enjoy adam sandler films that have the same plot but this was trying too hard to impress the jokes are very old so trust me this is not a film that most people could really get into but some did so i'll be
the problem i find with this title is that i am not sure if the director is trying to produce a documentary or movie a blend of the two genres just doesn't work and that leaves the whole thing hung in the middle of nowhere this is more so as the director has picked the most extremes of what is supposed to be happening around our everyday life making it an unconvincing documentary if it is meant to be a this is too dull and monotonous in either case what is the moral or the message which the director is trying to convey to the audience that around us there are people who ill-treat others who are willing to be ill-treated that there are many crazy lunatics around us what
a terrible movie as everyone has said what made me laugh was the cameo appearance by scott mcnealy giving an award to one of the murdered programmers in front of a wall of sun logos mcnealy is the ceo of sun microsystem a company that practically defines itself by its hatred of microsoft they have been instrumental in filing antitrust complaints against microsoft so were they silly enough to think this bad movie would add fuel to that no public record i see of involvement but clearly the makers of this movie know scott mcnealy an interesting mystery
the genre of suspense films really takes a dive in this one the big problem is implausability i realize that you need to create difficult situations which would cause suspense and the tense feeling of whats going to happen next but this movie was so predictable and is just not believable i find that the more i watch this kind of movie the more i am continually saying things to actors to direct them away from danger continually making bad decisions just borders on being plain stupid if they took the time to make it more realistic i might have enjoyed it a little having said that you might be better off staying away from this one
this can be one of the most enjoyable movies ever if you don't take it seriously it is a bit dated and the effects are lame but it is so enjoyable there are giant crabs that attack a girl oh and the crabs sing japanese it is amazingly bad and the ending which has been telegraphed throughout the entire film is hideously awesome predictable but seeing the final fight will leave you rolling in your seat don't even give this film a chance and you will love it susan george is fun to watch and yes she does appear naked her daughter isn't quite worth putting up with but she does get attacked by giant crabs they are the size of large cats this is a but i love it as a movie my god but for entertainment i give it a did i mention there are giant crabs
this is one of those awful sex-driven b-movies that couldn't have played anywhere near a theater women run around dressed in scantily clad bunny outfits an extremely fat woman is the brunt of many tasteless jokes and they all work at the restaurant of a dirty old man who has an oddball son hanks who is of course brother whom the man wants to get laid hanks is actually sort of good but this movie goes nowhere and has no point one must wonder why it was even made nevertheless because of performance and a few entertaining no more than a few it received a stellar out of i think i was being nice though
i read somewhere that hollywood should concentrate on remaking bad movies and leave the classics alone we can only hope while this remake wasn't a total waste i still wish i had the six bucks back to go toward a dvd of the original lots of violence and one of the worst endings i've ever seen this version doesn't add anything new it only reiterates why hollywood should leave the good stuff alone
jean luc marxist polemic is as close to unwatchable a film as you're likely to see from an internationally respected filmmaker bits of political theater mind-numbingly boring and interminable are interspersed with the making of sympathy for the devil featuring the rolling stones in the process of the development from mick jagger playing a demo on acoustic guitar to the backing vocals being recorded towards the end is fascinating and worth renting this film just to see the bits with the stones almost half the movie is devoted to this so thanks to the miracle of chapter stops you can skip all the bizarre political skits and just watch the stones put a song i had this on laserdisc i valiantly attempted to watch it all but i don't see how anyone could get through it i finally gave up and just chapter-skipped my way to the stones segments
fans of goremeister herschell gordon lewis should look elsewhere if they are picking up this film for his usual buckets of blood being sloshed about for there is precious little in the way of bloodletting in this film instead lewis decides to try and tell the bizarre story relying on bargain-basement special effects on a budget which could have probably been doubled if the cast had turned out their pockets for change one day oddly enough while cheap and very poorly acted by mccabe as mitchell the total outlandishness of the plot keeps attention throughout imagine what this film could have been like with a decent budget overall it strains for champagne tastes on a beer budget
it should first be said that i have read the manga and therefore my argument is based on the anime greatly disappointed me because it removed the comedy and high quality action of the manga and ova what it left behind was merely a husk of what it could have been many of the characters lacked the depth that is seen in the manga alucard is not the sympathetic character that secretly wishes for death story lacks the betrayal and the nazi villains that plot to engulf the world in war are completely absent instead the anime provides the gary stu villain incognito who is defeated against what appear to be all primary complaint is not that the anime diverges from the manga but that it does such a poor job
tromaville high has become an amoral wasteland of filth thanks to the aftereffects of the nearby nuclear accidental release of toxic chaos crammed with absurd violence and crude behavior rather horrible obviously intended to be mess of a film with the filmmakers cutting loose the reins allowing the untalented cast free reign to ham it up craft was far down list of objectives for this gory sleazefest the honor society are punks with eerie face paint jobs and wacky outfits the german teacher who becomes a member through a toxic kiss has the streaks down one side of her face that really gave me the toxic monster which dispatched the annoying punks towards the end is pretty cool of movie trash connoisseurs will embrace wholeheartedly
i really like slasher this one is truly acting is script is the atmosphere is plot is as deformed gardener charlie puckett slaughters people in a small american right-this is the night brings charlie isn't even gory enough-if the film ain't gonna be least they should make it this cheap piece of trash at all you want to see some good slasher flicks check out before dawn or just don't waste your precious time with this worthless piece of garbage
this film is another example of the curse of east asian cinema two or more separate stories rolled into one film other reviewers have obviously picked up on it as well because there are several mentions of the first part and second part how can you have any character development or a deep plot when the characters and the story are featured for such a short time i was enjoying the first part until it abruptly stopped didn't end it just stopped in what appeared to be the middle of the story to be replaced by an inane and totally unbelievable second part that seemed to focus around a girl rearranging and cleaning a apartment i look forward to the day when wong kar wai is given a decent script to work with
if this film was a comedy i would have given it a oh my where do i begin put it this way i've seen lots of terrible horror films but this one makes troll look like freakin saving private ryan as if a group of porn filmmakers decided to make a horror film changed their mind in midproduction and decided to do a comedy then went back to horror and then decided that they should have just stuck with porno at that everything about this film is simply terrible the musical score shoot the guy who invented the yamaha keyboard the script the directing the cinematography the acting there simply are no words to describe this oh wait yes there are holy
the plot of edison was decent but one actor in particular ruined the entire film justin timberlake ruined the film with every line he uttered during the movie he is by far one of the worst actors i have ever seen and should face the same fate as the entire squad it was an emotional scene an action scene or even a silent scene justin timberlake managed to ruin it not waste your time watching this film don't even bother downloading it midget porn would be a much better justin if you're reading this stick to music even though you're no good at that you've done a wonderful job tricking people into thinking you can actually sing
as myself and my other half are big fans of trash horror we couldn't resist getting out a movie that contained both of the greats we were thrilled however for a movie with a rip off cover of freddy vs jason this is a disgrace the worst film i have ever seen but worth a look for a laugh if you are able to sit through acting is awful the i could do better on my camcorder in fact its so bad they only bothered to put make up on the zombies faces and left out neck hands etc no story line weird flashbacks that make no sense and terrible broke my tooth from one vampire you broke my cigar was the response from the human who looked like uncle jessie from dukes crossed with santa
well done al gore you have become the first person to have made billion dollars of the global warming lie just like all the other man made in the world this one is up there with the best lies to have sucked in so many people sure polution is not a good thing and i would love for all the to keep on growing but global warming is a business it employes thousands of people that are all very it there are just to many things that just don't add up but well done al you failed as a politician but went on to make lots of money sucking in the next santa is real
good lord what were they thinking here is your spoiler warning even though i don't think it'll really matter you won't be seeing this piece of trash group of handpuppets go chasing after a group of really stupid people who go on a really stupid hunt for them to try and kill them and the puppets complicate things by letting them live out their really stupid fantasies in other words the whole thing is really know it has to be bad when even mike and the bots can't save something and they didn't i know some of their lines were funny like what to add to the sign hit and the hand comments but geez this was pretty dang i can say is do not watch this piece o crud it is not worth your eyes
i've seen many of guy films and liked most of them but this one literally gave me a headache john editing is way too frenetic and apart from a tour-de-force sequence showing a line of heads snapping to look at one object does nothing but interfere with the actors ability to communicate with the thing i disliked about this film was that it seemed more brutal than earlier his films have always had dark elements his sympathy for the characters gave the movies an overriding feeling of humanity this one seemed more like harshness for harshness i'm required to add more lines of text before imdb will accept my review i will mention that the actor playing guy maddin does manage to ape his facial expressions pretty well
this movie makes several mistakes a few american actors in spain and the spanish actors speaking english the spaniards english is ok but the way the acting is performed it makes it all quite annoying the dialog through the whole script is very weak it may have been a spanish script but translated incorrectly who knows and who cares i can only assume that these are famous spanish actors forced into the english language they may be good but not in this flop you will figure out the movie within the first minutes thats how pathetic it is then the rest is just bad lots of waste of time lots of un-necessary plots oh did i mention one of the baldwins is in this
this is definitely the worst movie ever done but at this point in his life he was just happy to have a movie there are or laughs in it but i used the fast forward button through some of it don't waste your time i only saw it because i wanted to see all of his movies but it sucked
no redeeming features this film is rubbish its jokes don't begin to be funny the humour for children is pathetic and the attempts to appeal to adults just add a tacky smuttishness to the whole miserable package sitting through it with my children just made me uncomfortable about what might be coming next i couldn't enjoy the film at all although my child for whom the dvd was bought enjoyed the fact that she owned a new dvd neither she nor her sisters expressed much interest in seeing it again unlike with monsters inc finding nemo jungle book lion king etc which all get frequent requests for replays
see here are the highlights of the brain machine establishing shots of a pool and a house establishing shots of a nondescript office building countdowns by a bland technician close-ups of a menacing guard and a myriad of technical babble to show us this is a high-tech posters have commented on the discrepancy between the copyright date of and the release date given on the dvd box of an easy one to explain this dog simply sat on the shelf unreleased for five years until someone dusted it off thinking it fit in perfectly with the post-watergate mood of distrust in government after seeing the brain machine now my only wonder is that it ever got released at all
i have a nice collection on movies going and this one was added to it number to be exact title had me going at first splatter university i thought this would be a great horror movie was i ever wrong don't get me wrong this is not the worst movie i have ever seen but it could have been a lot better i love all movies but this one was one that was more of a laugh then a scare audio quality poor acting and poor shot arrangements are some of the areas that could have been improved out of is ideal for a good laugh if your looking for one of those movies to make fun of then this is one
i'm a big fan of camp but when every plot twist is predictable and bad while obviously not trying to be even i lose interest i was going to rate this a but the ending dropped it a point easily its only saving grace is that i hated other movies more not enough beer in the world for this one
blank check is easily one of the worst films of the nineties the plot is completely pointless its overtones of lonliness are pathetic do you really believe a twelve year old acting as a personal assistant for a millionaire could accomplish everything in this film like buying a mansion for a mere grand the notion let alone the bargain-basement price will only be believed by the most gullible viewers please respect your intelligence and don't watch this awful awful film
a black guy fights and supposedly wins yeah obviously we're presented with a damm nice title a real nice tag line and even a nice plot line thats about it thats where it ends we move into fiction after jai white the black guy so don't get confused with the name portrays a black guy umm thats all there is to the so hard to find decent help must have hired the black guys friends to help cause the low budget low ineptness of this movie has the shadow trailing the first scenes yeah obvious idiot moment for the average guy like you and me but lines review submitted if you paid to see this movie you got screwed
all hype what better way to describe a movie about people who are upset because they can't release their film through a mainstream distributor consequently they do it themselves otherwise the hype of the film doesn't justify the content in the film the story is absent and could easily be a short the acting is poor but the animation and music is pretty good otherwise don't waste your time don't believe the hype however if you have the chance to see the film for free do so then you won't have to waste money still the filmmakers do a good job of pressing their story and creating cliffhangers with their self-indulgent mini-series otherwise they're one hit wonders who never had a hit
i bought this movie exciting a gloriously gratuitous over the top entertaining bloodbath i got none of them this film fails on practically every level not in the least frightening or funny it is simply terrible film-making and never provides the audience with anything worth seeing what is so bad about it is that far from being as raw violent and brutal as it had promised to be there is very little violence at all virtually no blood shed and no excitement whatsoever acting direction and dialogue is absolutely unbearable honestly it is truly laughable i could hardly sit through this total garbage once i certainly will never want to watch it again don't waste your time with a waste of celluloid like this it is truly possibly the worst film ever made if i could give it minus stars i would
this was a waste of minutes of my life the acting was atrocious and the plot was ridiculous it revolves around an evil lesbian who gets rich married men to have sex with her and then blackmails them for money one of the victims is a candidate for da which is causing problems in his relationship with his wife another is a plastic surgeon also married and the evil lesbian happens to seduce this guys wife too meanwhile the evil girlfriend doesn't really like her sleeping around it ends in a happy ending where all is forgiven the women get naked a lot too mostly in situations that stretch reality bad bad bad
we saw this on the shelf at the local video store saw coppola in the credits and got excited that was the one and only time this movie raised any interest i could never quite work out if it was an attempt at a humourous film that failed miserably or an attempt at a serious film that failed miserably in general the entire production seemed incredibly amatuerish the sound in particular was absolutely dreadful especially in the scenes shot in the little bar the dialogue was so corny in parts it was unbelievable very disappointing
an very good storyline good thrill to it but the last seconds destroyed the whole movie what happened extremely well made and an good story destroyed in the last seconds sorry to say but a in vote thats what it it deserve i would think that chris shadley could come up with a better end but maybe next time all this meaningless blood gore for nothing the end would lift the story to close to a but it didn't the end destroyed the whole story i think most people aren't lame and when they goes a movie thy want a good end even if it is intricate but the only lame here is the end sorry
i can see where the film makers were going with this but they never really reach their destination supposed to be a homage to spaghetti westerns albeit set in a sort of mythical modern time frame but unfortunately it fall short in its attempt it doesn't have that gritty realism that spaghetti westerns are known for the characters are not vile and desperate enough like their italian western counterparts and failing these two points it lacks the humor of a successful parody in fact it looks like they intended to make a serious film but upon completion realized they had missed the mark so far that it couldn't possibly be taken seriously unfortunately they also missed the humor mark by a mile a whole lotta bad movie
i'm going to go on the record as the second person who has after years of using the imdb to look up movies been motivated by film the abandoned to create an account and post a comment this was hands down the worst movie i've ever seen in my entire life the plot was on the verge of non-existence and none of the puzzle-pieces added up in any way whatsoever the acting was laughable and the writing was embarrassing how this film got backed and came to be is completely beyond me the only saving grace i could find was anastasia cunning and repetitive use of the f word brilliant sound design if i were faced with the option of seeing this film again or being mauled by wild bores i would be up against a difficult decision i'm disappointed that i am unable to give it stars
this worldwide was the cheap version of what the nwa under jim crockett junior and jim crockett promotions made back in the on the localized big stations during the saturday wrestling craze when ted turner got his hands on failed version of nwa he turned it into world championship wrestling and proceeded to drop all nwa references all together nwa world wide and nwa pro wrestling were relabeled with the wcw logo and moved off the road to studios in orlando florida and eventually became nothing more than recap shows for nitro thunder and saturday night worldwide was officially the last wcw program under turner to air the weekend of the wcw buyout from vince mcmahon and wwf today the entire nwa world worldwide video tape archive along with the entire video tape library in general lay in the vaults of wwe headquarters in
oh an idiotic cheap with fake special creature is played by one guy in lame stupid dialogues are unbelievably bad and these simply example i have never seen so annoying characters like in this dumb kids or pregnant woman with his husband and many in is a great entertainment if you're it like the i don't think so
i finally got to have a look at this experimental lynch short after waiting for so unfortunately it wasn't worth it even for a die hard lynch fan i found this to be really happens there are long long long painful pauses where nothing happens long monotonous speeches where nothing is said and the whole thing finishes with the viewer not knowing or caring what the hell it was all about what happened before and what happened afterward was a mulholland drive allusion the blonde girl and the brunette girl were very diane and rita and a lost highway moment with allusions to some significant event that happened but cannot be talked about clearly all very uninteresting and very dull nothing happens very forgettable and i think i will delete it from my computer and forget i ever watched it sorry david
sugar is one of the worst movies of the film tries to cross heathers and bring it on and fails when i saw last january i was so disgusted by the film that i walked and talked on my cell phone to my girlfriend for the last half hour of the movie i've heard that the dvd has a cut maybe i'll check it out but this trash movie is and the worst kind of maybe if the film had some that would've have made it okay but the gags are lame and the acting is horrible worse than a troma film
terrible story poor acting and no humour at all from the final joke at the sort of ugly angel is sent to earth to save a boy and his mum from being thrown out of their home supposed to be a kiddies movie but even they will not be amused by this terrible film
if exorcist ii the heretic did him no favors hard to imagine what thespian extraordinaire richard burton saw in this drab exercise in non-thrills you've seen it all before burton plays a writer who discovered at an early age he possesses the power to move inanimate objects through force of his mind you thought carrie had no impact on hollywood though adapted from a novel by peter van greenaway medusa plays like recycled goods though the special effects in the cathedral finale are solid typical lee remick is somewhat present as a doctor but otherwise the supporting cast is extremely weak burton is hammy but even telekinesis could save him at this point from
me i've seen some incredibly horrific movies in my time but this takes the i can't express in words how bad this film actually is besides the plot that isn't really there the comically crap acting the hilariously dreadful excuses for zombies you know what i could go on all day every little thing in this film is either stupid pointless crap or embarrassing i express to anyone who wants to watch this movie ashamed to say i have this on my rack hidden away right at the god damn bottom of the huge pile i couldn't even give this excuse for a film away how bad it is
a total waste of time just throw in a few explosions non stop fighting exotic cars a deranged millionaire slow motion computer generated car crashes and last but not least a hugh hefner like character with wall to wall hot babes and mix in a blender and you will have this sorry excuse for a movie i really got a laugh out of the dr evil like heavily fortified compound the plot was somewhere between preposterous and non existent how many millionaires are willing to make a million dollar bet on a car race answer but didn't they become millionaires through fiscal responsibility this was written for pubescent males it plays like a video game i did enjoy the gulfstream ii landing in the desert though
this movie is so aggrivating the main character looks like and i've seen scrawny beanpoles with more balls than this guy the plot twists are so predictable its not even worth watching for the humor some of the worst dialogue i've heard in years lets go find a small animal to can't even continue don't watch this pile of garbage it was made in one highlight is the drunk dude calling the main character a faggot for drawing out of unwatchable
this is just a terrible comedy it really is a bad film there are no funny elements no jokes that are funny i don't know how some people can claim this dismal short film could be smartest or quality perhaps if its the only film that a person has seen you can make that claim of the brothers but i have seen thousands of better films namely leonard part six funny i don't know how the brothers is even considered eligible to be listed on the internet movie database its more like a home video than an actual aside just skip this film a root canal is more enjoyable that this cliche-ridden unfunny material
i didn't even bother finishing the movie because i was so bored i thought i was going to pass out i was watching it in the movie theaters and me and my friends just got tired so we got up and left to another movie if i ever have to sit through min of that movie again i think i'm going to shoot i do know the whole entire movie because my friend told me what happened at the end and i wasn't surprised at all i mean who didn't know she was going to do the right thing and let him be happy i mean for real you would have to be a complete idiot not to know that i know i didn't miss anything and if somebody me to see that movie i would say over my dead body
this short spoof can be found on millennium edition dvd of night of the living dead good thing to as i would have never went even a tad out of my way to see zombies with bread sounds just like silly harmless fun on paper in execution a different matter this short didn't even elicit a chuckle from me i really never thought i'd say this but night of the day of the dawn of the son of the bride of the return of the revenge of the terror of the attack of the evil mutant alien flesh eating hellbound zombified living dead part in shocking was a very better parody and not nearly as lame or grade f
sir john gielgud must have become senile to star in a mess of a movie like this is one of those films i suppose that is considered art but don't be garbage stick to the art you can admire in a frame because the films that are labeled as such are usually unintelligible forgeries like this masterpiece giegud recites the tempest while the camera pans away to nude people one of them a little kid urinating in a swimming pool wow this is heady stuff and real art ain't it just one example most of the story makes no sense is impossible to follow and hence is one that liberal critics are afraid to say they didn't understand so they give it high marks to save their phony egos you want shakespeare read his books
laughed a lot because it is so incredibly bad sorry folks but definitely one of the worst movies i have ever seen i know it is low budget but anyway the actors behave like playing in a soap the dialogues are absolutely crappy and the last time i have seen such odd pictures was at a trash nite at some youth video festival ten years ago i really appreciate that people gather together and shoot cheap movies but at least a certain amount of quality should be accomplished but at least one good thing the first three minutes of the movie were quiet interesting and looked okay and the score was really worth listening to the dvd cover promised a lot but that is by far the best this film has to offer
you ever sit through a movie and after all over like one big wtf to decoy straight to video action fodder flick you can immediately forget about having watched or better yet don't watch it at all peter weller and robert patrick star and are quickly wasted in this going nowheres fast mercenaries-for-hire action dud where the story is pretty darn bad and the action sucks and the point of watching an action flick if the action blows robert patrick in particular hits a new low in an action sequence that has him firing a machine gun while standing on the hood of a moving school bus co-stars the ambient charlotte lewis and own scott hylands night heat fame
this movie purports to be a character study of perversion some reviewers have been gulled into assuming that because perversion is depicted the film is psychologically deep actually considering the salacious material it is surprisingly tedious and shallow with no motivational substance why is the main character the way she is you won't find out from the script for a better treatment of the same theme a more entertaining movie try belle de jour
the movie was completely misleading and the bonus material confirmed my impression that it was a rip-off of joeseph heart of darkness the river is replaced by a road and the boat becomes a jeep and walter kurtz is claims made on the outside of the dvd box was overt fraud this fabricated death of a journalist and present it as some portions have muslims supporting the attacks for the treatment of muslims around the world alerted the video store that the movie should be removed from their documentary section and be placed in the war-drama area for quasi fictional accounts of actual events
i really cant think of anything good to say about this a single thing the script is a nightmare the writer blurs the line between chemical and biological traits and doesnt seem to understand the difference you'd think they would at least get a technical advisor the performances were bad by most of the cast although i dont really blame them the material really stinks the editing was equally bad i'll just stop now its all bad
boy this was one lousy movie while i haven't seen all of the collaborations i can say with confidence that this is the worst this rich but ill woman of course owns this beautiful island in the meditteranean ruling over a put-upon staff when suddenly visited by this traveling poet who mouths platitudes in fact the whole film is just a talk fest with much of the talk making no sense even in no one could make heads or tails of this pretentious nonsense and the passage of time makes that even more clear if it weren't for the beautiful cinematography and scenery it would deserve a negative rating the only thing this film is good for is its unintentional laughs at the expense of the stars
most action films are crass of hindi cinema especially of sunny and his family film is typical sunny type with bashes big dialogues and film also has typical rajiv rai ingredients of many henchmen and a weird starting is okay and then the shift to kenya is good but then the film goes on and on sequence of events move at a slow pace and nothing that great are many stupid scenes like the kenya policemen are shown like jokers especially climax too is rai does an okay job music is okay only song works and that is the last toofan camera-work is deol is as usual chunky acts like a monkey while his serious scenes are laughable naseer is alright heroines are pure wood amrish puri is not even half as scary as he was in tridev the rest are okay
this movie causes more unintentional laughter than anything else i've ever seen really if you are a tolkien fan rent it just to laugh at it with your friends i won't be the millionth person to rip apart its flaws all i will say is that the movie me anyway lost major points for turning my favorite character sam into a bumbling idiot shame shame
at least the seats in the theater were comfortable and i ate the pop corn as loud as possible to drown out the inferior dialogue this is absolutely not a girls film any blokes who like it are the ones us ladies can be sure to stay far away from dumb story mediocre dialogue and an overall cheap looking film i've seen many many movies but this one is the new winner in the bad category if you do happen to see it the one thing you'll look forward to is the ending so you can finally run out of the theater as fast as you can
this movie was like the disney channel after dark take out the aren't we naughty language and themes and you are left with dialogue and plot devices that insult the intelligence of anyone who doesn't describe saved by the bell as quality television the dialogue so laughably cliched and knowingly dirty one might think the screenplay was the product of locking aaron spelling and joe eszterhas in a room with orders to produce an amalgam of every bad script each had ever had a hand in creating if that was roger intention mission accomplished
for months i've been hearing about this little movie and now i've seen it i find it cute cute how so many fledgling directors make movies where they combine other creative ideas in order to make their own one-joke premise of a movie troops swingblade any of the million blair witch parodies come to mind if all that these directors want is a foot inside door then they're doing the right thing and they should keep it up because combining plot outlines is how hollywood makes films how many times have you heard the phrase animal house meets back to the future wall street meets dead society or shakespeare in love meets star wars i remember when independent films meant original and daring not safe and predictable
this is a truly terrible only writing this so that some people somewhere are put off watching it if i have stopped one person from wasting some of their precious life watching this film i shall die dull although since it stars al pacino i was fooled into thinking that at any moment something interesting was going to happen then the credits rolled and i realised i had been completely fooled into watching this unbelievable cannot believe that this film has achieved as high a score as it has at imdb stars when i last saw the voting are you people voting please please do not watch this film
frequently said that movies can never equal the original book well in this case not only the movie is not as good as the book but is an insult to the book i'd rather see milan novel turned on fire than into this something which the director probably calls the beautiful philosophy that asks is it better to carry a heavy load on your shoulders or cope with the unbearable lightness of being is put aside and instead all the movie deals with is daniel day lewis cannot say tomas sexual adventures with his dumb wife his mistress and his other mistresses fran√ßois truffaut already said it bad directors make bad movies don't waste your time and money read the book instead really worth it
humm an italian movie starred by david hasselhoff and linda blair i expecting very much to be honest and in fact i took even less than i was expecting it mean this movie is the worst i have seen because i have watched worse things than this but the plot was most of the times confusing and uninteresting and some good gore scenes are the only thing saving this apart from that you are going to love some special effects they are really cheesy and bad now i only want to watch troll by this same director sure it is not going to be worse than that
greenthumb grace is left penniless after her husbands death so she turns to ganja-growing in order to pay the bills it sounds promising and the ever-reliable brenda blethyn doesn't disappoint but the material is sitcom-thin actually a scene where grace asks her young gardener to give me one toke and he thinks asking for sex and acts all awkward yes humour so twee a nun would be bored saving grace doesn't seem to know what it wants to be the stunning cinematography and stately pace evoke memories of daughter whilst the light-hearted whimsy of the country townsfolk could be lifted from any episode of antiques roadshow it does speed up after the first hour but by then too clich√©d to care the climax manages to be unpredictable only by introducing the most shameless deux ex machina i've ever seen
not my fault my girlfriend made me watch is nothing positive to say about this film there has been for many years an idea that madonna could act but she can't there has been an idea for years that guy ritchie is a great director but he is only middling an embarrassment all round
of course flatley is already not exactly the ideal name for a dancer but i think michael is really pushing the irony envelope with this new title feet of flames really can't resist recommending desenex foot spray to the retiring clearly ailing might add that much like that cheering london crowd review below i too am enthusiastic about this being his last live that it may be his last live performance flatley is cheered on by an enthusiastic london crowd perry seibert all movie guide
seriously i don't even know where to begin like somebody gave a bazillion dollar budget to an autistic third-grader and said make me a movie about the secret service the editing is ridiculous the cinematography was random at best every single syllable of dialogue was completely retarded and the directing well was there even a director there everything was just so pointless and lame and a spoiler for you this movie is the dumbest thing you'll ever see if you liked this piece you'll also enjoy deterrance dark blue and a partial frontal lobotomy
woman with wig who dyes her hair in the middle of the film of wig presumably does not see what the audience can see from miles begin spoiler alert that her hubby is having an affair with her best girlfriend and they both try get rid of her end of spoiler alert what a spoiler that was the title already gives it away doesn't it bad acting bad script waste of time oh yeah in the end she lives happily ever you liked this movie you'll really love cannibal women in the avocado jungle of death
this had to be one of the most god awful wrestlemanias ever and is only saved by matches the hardcore match between edge and mick foley also vince mcmahon against shaun michaels the main event between cena and triple h was a complete washout and to be honest i nearly fell asleep it was so actionless the casket match was not worthy of having the undertaker appear in it and the match between the boogie man and booker t was a complete joke if you are really a big fan of the wwe and have missed the early days of the wwf and the wrestlemanias and you'll probably love this but i found that this wrestlemania left a lot to be desired
that shall be a documentary i saw it is forbidden in germany and i have to say that it was the worst documentary i've ever seen it is nothing but one big lie from the beginning to the end who can doubt after this trash that all jews were supposed to be killed in the concentration camps
weak bobby pineapple salsa flay and mario batali bring this being the worst definitely a one trick pony i think they could have gotten other american chefs to come to the table on this one as the iron chefs the kind of dishes this duo come up with reflect on the creativity of the original iron chef series i don't think batali even went to chef school actually there are a lot of great chefs in america i just wonder why they don't appear on the food would also help to have more regional ingredients and perhaps co-hosts who can handle the pressure i like alton brown but he is a bit too for this role
from the start of this movie you soon become aware that the name of the film has nothing to do with the movie itself from watching a naked woman being chased by people in very silly masks to servants running round in the worst clothing i've ever seen and all this in subtitles makes this the kind of movie you should think twice about seeing and as the film slowly moves along you soon realise that the vampire is not a vampire you got to wonder where the title came from some parts of the film made a bit of sense with pierre and is father but as the film gets to its really silly ending you have got to think why end a film this way and surly they had a better ending if only in there heads this is not a film to watch basically
left behind is an incredible waste of more than million dollars the acting is weak and uninspiring the story even weaker the audience is asked to believe the totally implausible and many times laughable plot line and given nothing in return for their good faith not only is the film poorly acted and scripted it is severely lacking in all the technical areas of filmmaking the production design does nothing to help the credibility of the action the effects are wholly unoriginal and flat the lighting and overall continuity are inexcusably awful even compared to movies with a tenth of the budget however none of this will matter in that millions of families will no doubt embrace the film for wholesomeness and religious leanings and who can blame them however it is unfortunate that they will be forced to accept rate amatuer filmmaking
what a dreadful film this is the only reason you would want to sit through this mess is the pleasurable sight of miss eleniak the painful overacting of mr mcnamara which became embarrassing at times ruined what might have been a reasonable film if the correct actors had been cast mr mcnamara is no tom cruise the actor he obviously wants to be
after hearing raves about this movie for years i finally decided to rent it and watch let me start by saying that i'm glad that the rental was free from the local library this move was slow boring unrealistic and the plot made no sense after hours i was ready to nuke that backwater texas town and put the group of those characters out of their misery i realize that taste is subjective but believe me i just do not understand all of the hype that i have heard about this movie dallas provided as good a detail of the life in texas as this movie rent it only if you want to understand how movie studios can pay enough money to reviewers to convince the general public that a bad movie is good
this movie is an utter waste of time the plot is awful the dialogue is acting is ok but the actors have absolutely no plot or script to work with the photography and some of the special effects are ok too but again there is nothing interesting in this movie to watch there is no logical progression to the story the story line is utter nonsense it isn't even scary for a movie to be scary there has to be at least a small element of believability this movie has no believability at are only three characters in the movie each character is shallow and has no personality of the special effects and make up work are both badly done or at most hope you read this and do not waste time on this movie unless you are curious to see an entirely awful movie
wow what a waste of acting talent my husband and i sat there both thinking this has to get better these actresses are too good to have wasted their time on this crap unattractive characters hackneyed script and listless pacing make for a long two hours i actually couldn't hack it and left to do the grocery shopping litter being more appealing than this film the husband stayed and confirmed that it didn't get the time buddy is killed you were wishing they all would get hit by a car and end their miserable lives it would be infinitely more entertaining beautiful scenery and costumes can't keep this one alive
i do regret that i have bought this series i expected more action more objective picture and more consistency this is just a pure propaganda series very dark without any charm or romanticism it is just boredom itself i find the actors work quite weak as well o'donnell might seem charming as robin batman but in this picture he lacks any charm probably while he becomes older he is loosing his childish charm but does not gain any charm of a grown up it comes as no surprise that it was not shown in a lot of countries and is being sold in the uk for of the recommended price and was not even released in the netherlands
this movie was definitely not one of mary-kate and best movies i really didn't like it and i was kind of disappointed in that movie for some reason it seemed like it was a movie that they put together really fast in some parts it got so boring that i had to fast forward it it didn't have any bloopers or any exciting parts like their other movies
my wife and i just finished watching b√ªsu aka the booth she fell asleep during some parts of the movie i really wish i had taken a snooze with her but the unfortunate fact is that the main voice is so loud and grating that it was impossible for me to sleep when our protagonist speaks it makes me want to hear regis philbin and william shatner sing karaoke he also has no redeeming qualities i was hoping he'd get hit by a bus five minutes into the get me wrong i love asian horror cinema but the booth is extremely irritating and full of scenes that really make no damned sense at all if you want some good asian cinema check out a tale of two sisters or into the mirror avoid the booth like the plague especially if you suffer from frequent migraines
i cannot say enough bad things about this train wreck it is one of the few movies i've ever been tempted to walk out of it was a bad premise to begin with first pregnant male but then they tried to make it a spoof what were they spoofing all those real pregnant males this was the worst movie i have ever seen if it had enough votes it would be on the imdb bottom if it was possible to give it a zero i would and i would still feel i had given it too much credit
awful movie a shame that a few of top actors and actresses made such a lamentably poor is barely something changed since the first movie and the tv series same actors same prototype characters same scenario complications the team under emotional pressure but everything turn out tip-top after a predictable grand finale another constant fact in the work of jan verheyen is the exaggerated product placement on the shirt and along side the pitch ok but two times a commercial one of the characters about an internet provider is just over the rumour has it about the making of a second series for flanders commercial tv station vtm or not the station where jan verheyen is programmation manager since a few conclude and the golden raspberry award for worst foreign movie goes to team spirit
this movie lacked everything story acting surprise ingenuity and a soul fifteen minutes in i was staring at the screen saying how could all of these guys get together and consider themselves friends without the girl another fifteen minutes in i was praying for as much amanda peet as possible when a bad movie quietly rears ugly head eye candy is a nice consolation but there wasn't much of that cheated on all fronts
if there was a god he would have made sure this movie stayed in the toilet were it was crapped up this is by far the worst vampire movie i have ever seen i may never watch a vampire film again because of this movie it makes zombie lake look like the sound of music
this movie is quite possibly one of the most horrible horror flicks i've seen the length wasn't nearly long enough to include a good storyline also the way the foster parents died was just plain ridiculous the mother suddenly dies from falling through a shower after tripping over an action figure and the dad is shot by a police officer i can see where some originality might have been what they were going for but it could have been better also the cheesiness of it all made me want to press stop before it was over after hearing all of name and figuring out it was lucifer i wanted to gag yes interesting that lucifer was a woman but look at the name a name it should be given to a male character all in all the movie was a bore and could have used a better plot
this sleek sexy movie is a must-see only upon multiple viewings can one truly understand the uniqueness of this film personally i enjoy the narrator for his intelligent no subject left untouched style of narration the introduction grips you right away and holds you at the edge of your seat throughout the film he provides wonderful insight into the world of the trainables and allows the audience to really connect with internal horror this film exhibits the script itself holds the movie together wonderfully not only for kids but the elderly alike will gain a higher understanding of the trainables and the modern grasp that they have on the sexual experience ahead of its time and groundbreaking in cinematography it surely defines the word masterpiece
this movie is a disgrace to the major league franchise i live in minnesota and even i can't believe they dumped cleveland i realize at the time the real indians were pretty good and the twins had taken over their spot at the bottom of the american league but still be consistent anyway i loved the first major league liked the second and always looked forward to the third when the indians would finally go all the way to the series you can't tell me this wasn't the plan after the second film was completed what happened anyways if your a true fan of the original major league do yourself a favor and don't watch this junk
this film is a twisted nonsense of a movie set in japan about a dysfunctional family who end up with a strange violent guest who just sits back and watches the members of the family at their worst nothing is sacred in this movie with sex drugs and violence stretched to such a limit i'm surprised it got past the i think it will appeal only to those whom we shouldn't be encouraging rather than any supposed underlying message coming out for the rest of us to consider a film that panders to the worst element in society and is in anyway utter gash a disappointment from a man who made the sublime dead or alive and audition movies
the characters are cliched and predictable with everyone being either snow-white pure or wholly evil the acting is too stilted for it to be bad in an amusing over-the-top way doubly disappointing if you're a bette davis fan because her character is not a typically fun bette-davis-type character she just gets to frown pensively a the whole neither my wife nor i found the movie to be interesting moving or enjoyable at all
a truly frightening film feels as if it were made in the early by a straight person who wanted to show that gays are good normal mainstream-aspiring people retrograde to the point of being offensive ltr suggests that monogamy and marriage are the preferred path to salvation for sad lonely sex-crazed gays wow who knew the supporting characters are caricatures of gay stereotypes effeminate buffoon the bitter lonely queen the fag hag etc and the main characters are milquetoast middle-class middlebrow clones of little far as the romantic ideological struggles of the main couple are concerned not much to say we've seen it all before and done much better
i find myself wondering what the people who gave this a saw in it that i didn't this movie has a very hard time following staying to a plot if someone tells you a comedy don't be fooled about percent odd-drama and comedy all actors turn in a great performance that cannot be denied however it seems like it really lost something somewhere don't know if the original script was good and it had to be edited down or what this had potential and instead it was really a flop i would really like the hour and a half i invested in this movie back but the video rental place doesn't do returns on time save your money and see something else
how this film could miss so many of the fascinating complex and mysterious aspects of the original story or the original movie is truly remarkable an unbelievably thin and unengaging plot ankle-deep and a really awful soundtrack tension with vast swathes of noise replacing the arcane musical references of the original for digitised crashes and roars then there are the specific references to the original which are merely plastered on over the cracks dreadful in a world where gormless brain-dead amerikan remakes of the italian job tear appears get carter uncontrollably and alfie have desecrated our screens recently this one takes the proverbial biscuit execrable nonsense how ellen burstyn ever got involved is a wonder rubbish
i checked this one out on dvd for a dollar so i could easily smile as this dreadful movie unfolds every time that you think it cannot get any worse it inevitably does the acting is absolutely horrific the plot makes no sense at all the title cold vengeance in the us dvd version has absolutely nothing to do with the script the action scenes are so obviously taken in their first take there are lots of mistakes during dialogues indicating that there is just no intend to do another take to at least try to make this movie bearable i cannot remember having seen a worse movie and i do occasionally get bad except for unstoppable with wesley snipes no who am i kidding while a bad one unstoppable deserves best picture awards at the oscars when compared to this piece of crap
a hideous little production apt to give one nightmares as well as headaches an unsightly blend of live action and ugly stop-motion animation weird but not the kind of fun weird trip anyone optimistic might expect the cold inhuman unfriendly sickening even creepy kind of weird there is absolutely no reason to watch this movie after all disney did a fantastic job with the same source material and cosgrove-hall did far more attractive things with this is a french production as such it re-enforces the stereotype that the french have no concept of scary
horrible acting horrible cast and cheap props would've been a lot better if was set as an action parody style movie what a waste starting from the name of the enemy naming it action movie would've made it better to the parody effect the cop looking like a year old player the blond girl just having the same blank boring look on her face at all times towards the end of the movie him and her are working together to take down the bad guys and every time they exchange words it just feels like the cheap lines given before a sex scene in a porn movie horrible don't waste your time
this is possibly one of the worst movies i have ever seen i don't care what the critics say bad i think the problem is with novel not that unfilmable just that like of his work pretentious and overdrawn he seems to be enamored with characters come off as navel-gazing and his novels as a whole are misogynistic i have read many of his works his socialist realist poetry that was truly awful i just don't understand what the fuss is about characteristics the self-absorption in his novels make for infuriating reading in a movie all the things that i dislike about kundera were magnified maybe i just missed something but i don't think so on a side note i cannot believe that this is a criterion collection dvd no way is this movie that essential
set in the seed centers around convicted serial killer max seed sanderson who killed people in years he is sentenced to death but in the electric chair he doesn't die even after being shocked three matt bishop par√© and other officers cover up this secret by burying seed alive seed breaks out and goes after the people who put him in his living by the worst director in the world boll seed is nothing more than a snuff film about trying to stretch the envelope of decent society and fails to deliver in any aspect of a storyline and he said this is based on true events because if a person survives the electric chair after being shocked three times they will be set free this is an urban legend and it would never happen much like other abominations in the dark for one seed is just utterly horrendous
i wish i could say that this show was unusual in it is usual in every has the dumb smarter but boring and conventional wife along with the idiotic sidekick for comic relief-it sorely needs predictable jokes with even more predictable reactions from the laughtrack punctuate this noxious mental nauseatingly unimaginative plot lines to leave me either physically ill or in a deep sleep more resembling that of an induced coma but it might be on for a while yet because it gives the average american a personage to which they can truly regular guy just like you and live in the southern so to me this show is just the opposite of here that obnoxious character is everywhere in some form or him on television is brutal overkill
st√∂rtebeker is truly one of the worst tv mini-series ever made on this acting is unbearable and the historic background is mostly nonsense just two examples visby was shown as a village of three houses instead it was a major city at this time best days already passed by secondly hamburg would have never been the city taking care of pirates in the baltic sea hamburg had no access to the baltic sea the major town at that time was worse than all that the directing how can a dilettante like this guy be allowed to direct a movie like this impossible there was not a single believable scene it the fights were ridiculous and i could not suppress laughter at most stern can't understand at all how a major television station could be so incompetent
nada was the most inadequate follow-up to les noces rouges now as the last good movie of golden era nada is first real attempt at a wholly political previous work les noces rouges had also political elements but it was more a psychological thriller with the usual look at society in french includes lot of really heterogeneous cast gives the movie the coup de gr√¢ce only had already played with the director and maurice garrel are up to romance one of actresses belle equipe panique is wasted as a madam actors nada this a second period of barren inspiration for chabrol it would be violette nozi√®res before he was again at the top of his game
brilliant book with wonderful characterizations and insights into human nature particularly the nature of addiction which still resonate strongly for the movie eh nothing special the cameraman clearly had an unfortunate addiction to circling and circling and circling around everything making the viewer quite nauseous why the director didn't put a stop to this is beyond maybe he was too busy trying and somehow failing to draw good performances from these normally excellent but inappropriately-cast actors all in all a weak adaptation your three hours would be better spent reading re-reading the book
for a science scare movie to work well it has to be either truly original or a very good retelling this movie is neither sure there is a pseudo-original twist in that the guy kills people because of a toxin and not because of a disease but that is a very minor twist there is the government conspiracy angle the crusader protagonist who has personal one real drawback of this movie is that the contaminated man has no pathos although the character is scripted to be someone who should be pitied he is not without the pity the movie is pointless the other characters are so cookie cutter they are ridiculous the subplots are convoluted and annoying and the saddest thing is the movie is too flat to even be enjoyed as mock material make the movie a minute short and it might be worth watching
mere thoughts of going overboard babes ahoy make me want to weep throwing yourself out a window would be better than watching this movie not even a supposed so bad good movie i would spend money to buy copies of this movie and burn them so that people can't see it oh the pain the pain
the dancing was probably the only watchable thing about this film and even that was disappointing compared to some other films my me this is the worst kind of film one that assumes a work of art because it has all the trappings of film-as-art yes beautifully photographed but ultimately lacks the depth and tension of the dance around which the film supposedly surrounds itself tango is a tease hot it has drama audacious precisely what this film is not
i guess i have still enough brain left to not find this movie funny comedians but a very poor movie the best performance still did nina hagen did you realize that it the real world scenes hamburg the cars are almost only new bmws guess i have still enough brain left to not find this movie funny comedians but a very poor movie the best performance still did nina hagen did you realize that it the real world scenes hamburg the cars are almost only new bmws
absolute garbage the reason that this is so terrible is not because it deviated from the formula but because the plot was just pathetic supposed star didn't do anything to solve the case and neither did anyone else really it was just routine police work utterly sat right till the end hoping for a twist and got nothing but a huge sense of disappointment was so much potential in having a relative in apparent kidnap could the personal involvement finally cloud his judgement the obvious signs were of a stranger doing it but surely a genius like lt c by constant conversation with the wronged husband would gradually uncover a fiendish plot involving a tape recorder playing in the shower room while a masked groom surprises the bride hides the body and then plants subtle clues it could have been good it was a complete waste of time
for the life of me i can't figure out why anyone would make a movie like this the plot is tired the acting is strained the language is consistently foul and at times the over use of the f word seemed like a lack of dialog was prevalent so throw in another couple of for good measure what the american public wants to hear gossett was particularly foul and seemed to enjoy his part forget this rent shrek and have a good laugh
i rarely write reviews for but i feel compelled to warn potential viewers that this movie is terrible just terrible i like shaw bros movies not a hater and i had high expectations for this one since i found it listed on many best kung arts movies websites now convinced that those best lists are all cut-and-paste jobs first of all barely any action in the film most of the movie consists of talking about the plot which is an amazing feat because thin at best and the action itself may have been impressive back in but routine by standards a special warning to netflix users the dvd they ship is terrible the picture is horrendous and not even enhanced
yet another british romantic comedy which audiences all over the world seem to have a ravenous appetite for this feeble effort is an unintentional parody of the genre all the classic clich√©d scenes are here from ridiculously elaborate misunderstandings to running after departing trains to declare love the characters are one-dimensional caricatures save for love-hewitt who manages to bring some cohesion to the film things threaten to spiral out of control in the plausibility department as the film progresses our good-natured suspension of belief finally comes crashing down during the preposterous ending if you're looking for a bridget jones notting hill kind of experience you won't find it here
thank god i didn't waste my money renting it but i downloaded it this happens to be the worst movie i have ever seen in my whole life visual effects unnecessary gore and nudity far apart from other zombie movies like night of the living dead and others there are lots of loop holes and mistakes in the movie ok if you get time after reading this comment please check out the lommel profile after seeing that i got a self explanation why the movie is like this i mean every movie directed by ulli lommel gets a rating between and and now am not willing to search what kinda movies these are directed by him but i can finish all this by saying one strong sentence even for fun or time pass or even at an extreme bored situation please do not watch this movie
warning is your typical disney correct what with the foster home that has an even divison of the viewers intellect with its simplistic slezy father is almost directly taken from the never ending story a world full of and other proplems that need to be taken care a losing team is worthy of divine you know that angels don't like swearing where the heck did that come helping the angel cause pain and humilation on the opposing angelic team the angels are helping are you angels disney at its got his training wings brillent did not like it at all
i'm allowed to write words about this film but one word could suffice bizarre hubby and i didn't laugh so much as gawk at this truly dreadful movie we kept looking at each other with our best what the expressions there is no way to adequately describe this movie killer tomatoes were funny but this is just sick what kind of mind produces images like these and then puts them on film for others to see what kind of mind includes innocent children in this weird weird movie and then packages it as if it is appropriate for children parents whatever you do if your child still believes in santa don't let see this movie preteens can watch it probably with what the expressions on their faces if you decide to inflict this movie on others you might want to spike their possibly the worst film ever made
first of all i would just like to say to everyone who has seen this movie that the actor who played the transvestite is one of my friends his name is robert dugdale a terrific actor although it doesn't say much about his filmography been in several plays and musicals he is currently residing in terrace that is where i am from he comes over to our house almost every saturday okay now about the movie i wouldn't recomend this to anyone who hasn't seen it for it is not a movie worth watching the main reason i found it to be a bad movie is it never stays in place it keeps bouncing back between time so kinda hard to follow at some points and second its really boring although the acting is great the movie just doesn't compare
this is a movie that relies solely on the somewhat controversial image of incest and lesbianism to get is dialogs are pathetic and the sensuality of the sex scenes is absolutely acting and the dialog are more suited for high-school the subject is intended for adult audiences it is a gutless and shallow could have been way better if it had a story and more drama ah and on top of that one more thing why are inner monologues so excessively used makes it seem so in all an embarrassing movie for romanian cinema as well as for mature audiences attempting to view know the means are scarce but that is not always an excuse for a movie flopping as this one please start using some good actors in your movies and stop recycling them from musicians chirila they can't act
this wasn't funny in not funny a lot of other people i'm not bashing the film because it is incredibly sexist i quote enjoyed that bit or rather i enjoyed the reaction it generates in annoying pc people i'm bashing it because it is poorly written and only really memorable character is blakey which british people years old will recognise immediately since he was a favourite with impressionists for a long
i watched this movie really late last night and usually if late then i'm pretty forgiving of movies although i tried i just could not stand this movie at all it kept getting worse and worse as the movie went on although i know suppose to be a comedy but i didn't find it very funny it was also an especially unrealistic and jaded portrayal of rural life in case this is what any of you think country life is like definitely not i do have to agree that some of the guy cast members were cute but the french guy was really fake i do have to agree that it tried to have a good lesson in the story but overall my recommendation is that no one over watch it just too annoying
i wanted to vote zero or lower i loved the commentary it is the worst movie ever made and unendurable is the perfect word for it unless there is something worse that roget never thought of i am also at a loss to think of anything negative enough to accurately describe bo derek the best that could be said of her is consistent
someone needed to make a car payment this is truly awful makes jean cyborg look like gone with the wind this is an hour i wish i could sue to get back luckily it produced severe somnolence from which i fell asleep how can actors of this caliber create this dog i would rather spend the time watching algae grow on the side of a fish tank than partake of this wholly awful concoction of several genre i now use the dvd as a coaster on my coffee table at walmart is far too much to spend on this movie if you really have to have it wait till they throw them out after they have carried them on the inventory for several years and are frustrated that they would not for the love of god let this movie die of obscurity
while not quite as monstrously preposterous as later works this slow-moving repetitive giallo offers some nice touches in the first half but grows more and more lethargic and silly as it stumbles to its lame be sure the actors are above average considering this is an argento movie and some moments show the visual skills but whole sequences should've been cut and basically just the same exploitative trash as ever wallowing in fake science and abnormal sexual out of genetic disorders
the lowest score possible is one star a shame really i'm going to lobby imdb for a zero stars option to give this film even a single star is giving way too much am i the only one who noticed the microphones dangling over head at the station and the acting or should i say the lack thereof apparently talent wasn't a factor when the casting director came to town my little elementary school talent show provides greater range and depth of emotion and those fake irish accents were like nails on a chalk board the only thing that could have made this movie worse would have wait already as bad as it can get
this is a very sad movie really nothing happens in this movie the script is bad i guess they've just copy-paste the first pages to pages the producers must have thought create a hollywood movie here in belgium they didn't succeed now in the third week it is only running in antwerp and brussels at or something in the past we have had really good movies in belgium like daens shades is a waste of your time maybe you could sneak in the theater after you've seen a real movie if you've seen minutes of shades you've seen it all it was advertised to death on local radio and tv i hope it will disappear in the shades soon
a pretty obvious thriller-by-numbers in which the only possible twist turns out to be a hiding to nothing i was watching principally for the english-language performance by isabelle huppert it wasn't great but then it was a strange role i wouldn't be surprised if half her contribution turned out to have been left on the cutting-room floor along with several last minute script acting is the least appealing thing about this film steve guttenburg looks like trying to flesh out his role with the charm that told him he has a sensationally stupid sequence in which suggested that his sexual prowess will be able to help treat ptsd an uninteresting performance elizabeth mcgovern is more of a draw with genuine charm and character but small consolation
after having red the overwhelming reviews this film got in my country i but wanted to see it but what a disappointment to see a bunch of one-dimensional characters in a plot that lacks of originality is not worth the money and the time to spend i sometimes wonder about the filmcritics in switzerland
it seems that the intention of the film was to show the aggressive character of russians or at least of those russians able to travel outside their big country that it is too easy to rob a bank in england and that british police is so inefficient that it cannot find the person who robbed the bank even when these subjects are leaving the country by air in addition nicole kidman and the supposed russian colleagues spoke a language not yet identified anywhere probably spoken by aliens in the ural mountains but far to be the russian one so nicole if you really want to talk russian kindly go to moscow or st petersburg and keep yourself busy learning russian language grammar and its pronunciation
i expected this to be a lot better i love tim work so i was really excited to see these online short films well they weren't at all what i had don't really know what exactly it is i don't like i guess they're just sort of dull the sound bothers me and most of the characters although i loved roy the toxic boy and match girl episode probably bugged me the most although it was pretty also don't like the way some of the characters die like how match girl basically set the gas station on fire or how the girl who stares died in general death was amusing surprisingly death by a car freshener very original that made me laugh so are some things that aren't appropriate for kids just some language and gore about all i have to say
this is without a shadow of a doubt the absolute worst movie steven seagal has ever made and that says a lot don't get fooled by the rating way too good this abomination hadn't even been worthy of a rating if such a thing existed absolutely no plot worst action scenes ever and there aren't too many of them either seagal doesn't do anything himself including the fighting talking of dubbing and so on as always seagal is fat lazy and couldn't care less about this movie something which is very obvious all the way all the other garbage dtv movies seagal has made multiply them with each other multiply this with a thousand billions and all the badness you then get won't even describe of this absolute crapfest
how did such a terrible script manage to attract this cast ridiculous predictable and thoroughly unbelievable this is well-acted and slickly directed but the material is so bad it still qualifies as one of the all-time worst thrillers i've seen in years amazingly bad and not in a fun way avoid at all costs even if you're a fan of someone in the cast
the golden era of disney cartoons was dying by the time the end of the this show quack pack shouldn't even be considered a ducktales spin off because the show barely had anything to do with ducktales about a teen-aged huey dewey and louie as they make trouble for their uncle donald and talk in hip-hop lingo and they are fully dressed unlike in ducktales i prefer the little adventurous nephews from ducktales there are humans in duckburg and the ducks are the only animals living in duckburg no references of scrooge mcduck the stories are repetitive the plot is boring but the animation is good if you want lots of slapstick humor i recommend this to you if you want a better disney show watch darkwing duck or ducktales
i've always been a great fan of woody allen and always will be for most of what he did in the past but only a blind lover could ignore how dull meaningless pretentious and most of all horrendously acted this movie is a vacuous mental masturbation based on inconsistent grounds and what a disastrous idea to artificially recreate a presumed actor allen-clone that is putting into will mouth and gestures what allen would have done in place had he been years younger the outcome was obviously ludicrous and not to speak of the dialogues what was intended to be philosophical reflections turned into an involuntary mockery of intellectual pondering unaware of its comic effect how sad
i actually like asylum movies i've made it a habit to see as many as possible even the rip-offs they've done have been cool like exorcism and when a killer calls this is just plain lame i can't believe that the same people who made dead men walking and curse actually made this movie too not even laughably bad like jolly roger or alien abduction by the way are pretty bad this is just bad i mean i can appreciate forgive bad acting or lame special effects in an asylum movie but this film takes itself way too seriously i really hope that snakes on a train is better now a movie i can't wait to see
very bad i mean very plot is predictable and eally cheesy the creativeness of the battle and the dance scenes for the time are the only reason i didn't give the movie a one other than is def a movie one can def afford not to feel while watching the movie the idea behind the movie was an interesting one tho kind of country bumpkins to the city blah blah blah but i feel it might have been at least a little better if it just wasn't so cheesy very poorly portrayed from idea to screen i think the plot is somewhat predictable at times tho the dancing i can say at times is pretty good the break dance battle twist was u just pop the movie and watch the dance scenes and make up your own dialog maybe it can be a
this starts off bad what with the three women acting like simpering junior high school wussies sitting around giggling with their gin endless cigarettes and a caramel chocolate treat for the one who tells the best man story and then it gets worse spoiler alert what with character falling for the young organ player who used to be her student when he was the headmistress of an english school believe it or not only to have him destroyed thanks to her bitch-from-hell girlfriend and then from there basically unwatchable claptrap she forgives her friend and has the organ love child and the women end up as they started drinking more gin and smoking more cigarettes blah blah blah character throws the caramel chocolates out in the street in a pathetic attempt to symbolize growth have mercy
the social commentary was way overblown and the mystery itself is built and solved through a series of implausible coincidences that were entirely unbelievable nothing has changed in personal life in the past decade that makes it remotely interesting even had trouble understanding why he was complaining about his stay in australia as compared to the opportunities to solve mysteries that he has in england can he not insinuate himself on the australian police it seems like a very artificial plot point to get him involved in a crime latter episodes of the original series were pretty melodramatic and implausible sometimes bordering on silliness and this one picks up that mantle rather than returning to the focus of series one sad
the storyplot was okay by itself but the film felt very bubbly and fake it also had the worst ending they were probably going for a surprise ending but all it did was leave me the question of what the whole point of the story was all other teen movies are better than this one
terrible film with frank sinatra as tony rome here he gets involved with a dead woman below the is soon hired to find out what happened to a woman naturally the woman below the sea her room mate lainie kazan soon winds up dead on the aging richard conte plays a police officer and friend of rome when a local club owner gets killed the blame falls on rome and there becomes an interesting chase scene how bad this picture is if you have to depend on a chase scene to supply the welch plays the beauty up to her neck in intrigue her acting leads a lot to be desired gabel is a retired hoodlum whose son is trying to outdo the end you don't know why the girl was murdered don't even bother to ask
ronald colman won a best actor oscar for showy performance as a popular stage thespian who completely loses himself in his roles particularly as othello critically-lauded george cukor film has a marvelous pedigree having been written by the estimable team of ruth gordon and garson kanin unfortunately the witty banter comes off as self-conscious here and the backstage business is overripe mikl√≥s r√≥zsa also won an oscar for his score and shelley winters has a few fine moments a tough waitress theatrical colman breathlessly addresses her she asks him what are ya some kind of nut otherwise this scenario is awfully obvious surprisingly draggy and not very funny from
there is a remark that one of heroines was raped on drunken rampage by russian soldiers which is completely untrue this movie should not be shown only because of there is a statement by someone that kgb prosecuted jews gypsies etc which is worse than nazis kgb was looking for so called zionist agents who were believed imperialist agents this is totally different from targeting jewry as a whole nation as nazis did gypsies were never prosecuted kgb was political tool and used politically but from internationalist standpoint communists really did not distinguish between movie stinks like fake main hero does not speak russian signs in berlin contains typographical errors kgb general looks totally phony some so called russian proverbs are totally made up and list goes on and recommended to watch this movie is full of lies and phony stuff go to good shepherd instead
the story at the outset is interesting slavery in the century from west africa to the arab middle east the problem with it is that it intentionally castigates two of director richard favorite enemies arabs and germans to make us believe that very arab-looking men would be free to roam around and easily catch blacks in west africa is as believable as whites hunting for slaves in roots obviously both trades run by locals and much more sophisticated networks while arab countries are complicit in child and sex slave trade israel is one of the worst violators according to amnesty international so why only point out arabs and then choose a german as the only european buyer obvious bias and hatred of those people by a jewish acting is above average especially by peter ustinov and kabir bedi michael caine linderby is good as always
watching this movie l thought to myself what a lot of garbage these girls must have rocks for brains for even agreeing to be part of it waste of time watching it faint heavens l only hired it the acting was below standard and story was unbearable anyone contemplating watching this film please save your money the film has no credit at all l am a real film buff and this is worse than attack of the green only hope that this piece of trash didn't cost too much to make money would have been better spent on the homeless people of the world l only hope there isn't a sequel in the pipeline
please save your money and go see something else this movie was such piece of crap i didnt want to go but i had to so i thought i'd laugh at least once nope not a single laugh it was that horrible chris kattan will never get a good comedy role after this and a night at the roxbury this movie is completely obvious has no smart humor at all and just repeats itself over and over again listen to me and stray as far away from this movie as you possibly can
stereotyped derivative unoriginal and boring western the two popular stars heston and james coburn both give performances that are far from their best and justifiably so they both have superficial roles and character traits stated mainly by dialogue heston is a sheriff who liked the world better as it used to be before and coburn is an outlaw who owes something to the man who locked him up and has to pay his debt additionally heston is so old that he has trouble riding a horse and coburn is mean and tough but not as cold-blooded a killer as some of the minor villains apparently the filmmakers couldn't come up with even one original idea about how to make this movie somewhat distinguished
this movie has beautiful scenery unfortunately it has no plot in order to have a plot there must be a conflict this movie had none it spent two hours painting a beautifule scene and failed to ever place any activity in it the picture trys to be artistic but fails to pay attentions to the fundamentals of story you love montana scenery and fly fishing you will find some value in this film just don't expect a story there isn't one
i looked forward to watching this film and then realised that any hope of a coherent dialogue between the actors was swamped by the unnecessary swearing now i am not a prude in any way but to shout obscenities at each other does not a good film make ewan bremner is arguably one of the worst actors in the world at this time his performance in the god awful life of stuff his cockney accent is almost as bad as his edinburgh accent avoid how many more of these films kiss kiss bang bang beautiful creatures do we have to suffer before the film makers realise that the f-word the word etc does not replace proper dialogue
i was subjected to this atrocity by my wife tried to turn it off after minutes but was forced through the whole thing this must be hands down the most gruesome pretense of a movie were great script moments such if she gets over here right away she gets a bonus madam a boner sammy no a summarize horrible script terrible acting and incredibly illogical
this film originally released at christmas was long thought lost a very poor copy has resurfaced and made into a cd now for sale don't buy it the film is unspeakably terrible the casting is poor the script is awful and the directing is roland young singing and dancing and that was the this movie was lost deliberately
disney has yet to meet a movie it couldn't make at least two sequels about and this one was no exception to the people at disney to give a weak story to receive a quick reward somehow although i did not pay to view it i feel cheapened by watching is grown up now and had a daughter yet doesn't allow the daughter to go into the sea because of some idle threat made by the sister of the deceased sea-witch so here we go daughter is tricked course and helps the sea-witch after a not-so-glorious battle she is defeated and the mermaids and humans live in harmony is nothing to view here go back to your lives
the movie uses a cutting edge title for a lame story kill kill would have been nice the movie incorporates taboo scenes to make the viewer move back in their chairs the scenes are unnecessary and choppy the movie is something a novice screen writer could have conjured just a waste of movie props and network money i have to write lines of text to critique this film when it is not worth lines of my time but i have to push on to let the people know to avoid the nonsense if people are counting on you to choose a good movie for movie night pick something else if you have a soul don't damage it by subjecting yourself to this filth
sometimes making something strange and contemporary doesn't always work to advantage while i will admit that the set design and concept of the film was rather interesting the execution of these ideas into one congruent story just didn't work this film was so hideously slow and pointless not even robin williams could save this garbage obvious barry dream fell flat on its face but he should have warned the rest of the world about this slop
as a big fan of the original film hard to watch this show the garish set decor and harshly lighted sets rob any style from this remake the mood is never there instead it has the look and feel of so many television movies of the seventies crenna is not a bad choice as walter neff but his snappy wardrobe and swank apartment don't fit the mood of the original or make him an interesting does his best to make it work but samantha egger is a really bad choice the english accent and california looks can't hold a candle to barbara velvet voice and sex appeal lee tries mightily to fashion barton even his performance is just gruff without feels like the tv movie it was and again reminds me of what a remarkable film the original still is
if this movie should be renamed it should be the jackasses of hazzard to sum it up this movie is nothing but minutes of two immature country punks joyriding the famed dodge charger around town and in the country chasing the girls and eluding the have been a fan of the dukes and what tarnishes the movie is the characters are out of key the overindulgence of profanity sexual references and drug use has made the good name of the dukes into trailer from comparing it to the television show the acting was horrible the only actor that got it right was the famed dodge charger named general lee the others have exaggerated the role which tarnished the dukes have been another casualty of the century hollywood television-to-big screen transition tragedy skip this movie and just buy the television series on grade f
i've been willing to put up with a lot from action fluff movies but in general been due to the fact that most of them have reasonable payoff cool special effects interesting plot twists comic value steve buscemi etc this movie however had none of this all that we got was the cheap thrill of several minutes of eva cleavage issue of maxim is cheaper than a movie ticket there is an embarrassing lack of plot suspense back story character development continuity etc i would get into specifics but quite frankly i've already-maybe willingly-forgotten most of the entire time i was in the theater i was kicking myself for not just spending the afternoon watching a season on dvd save your money on this one folks unless you really really really like eva cleavage
this film so not funny such a waste of great stars who seem to be caught up so in their own stardom that they forget only shining moments belong to john cleese as the hotel manager who likes to dress up you almost fall out of your chair with helpless laughter when he dances to donna bad girls while wearing high heels a mink coat and a dainty hat the rest forget it
why did i waste my time with this movie there was not a single funny joke or line throughout the slapstick wasn't even mildly funny i mean really an out of control vacuum sucking pipe why has the national name been attached to this movie even christmas vacation was better than this actually thought that film was very like the plague
anyone who is a sucker for jazz dress the charleston and ultra-swanky yachts me on all counts will want to like this movie but the sad fact is that all there is the plot is banal and obvious the acting mostly either awful or playing to the farcical side of the goings-on and when the whole over there is not much left but the impression of mirrors and smoke this is a beautifully made bad movie
my wife is a fanatic as regards this show that being the case i bought her seasons one through three and season four is on order i personally think the show is one big farce the cast is equally bad alyssa milano should have stuck to the other trash movies she made such as poison ivy embrace of the vampire to name a few the other female supporting cast members are equally inept in their portrayals i've seen better special effects in the old republic pictures serials i saw as a child i can understand why the male leads remained on the show for such short periods of time even though i don't know if it was their own choosing or not please please don't renew for another season as enough is enough bob
not sure if i'm referring to those who labeled this a video nasty or to the hunter sure is one bizarre horror plot is a loosey goosey combo of superior films like cannibal ferox and cut and run chick gets kidnapped in the jungle by a tribe of savages the jungle looks more like a park somewhere in mexico the tribe is like a group of hippies who walk around in party city-style halloween costume renditions of tribal garb and the savages range in race from white to asian to black to hispanic i suppose franco just grabbed anyone who looked even slightly ethnic for this make matters worse this film has ultra-minimal gore no real scares and a lot of unnecessary penis not fun i can find something to like in just about any sleazy italian or euro-trash film this one just fell way out of kids
i wanted to watch this movie but one bizarre ridiculous scene after another forced me to shut it off don't seem to react to anything consider this heath ledger is walking a night a cemetery i believe when he is attacked by spirits which he drives away once past this ordeal he calmly walks away and meets up with a friend that saw it all when asked what happen he says blandly attacked by demons nothing serious as if this is only a little more exciting than a flat shut it off when they go to ask something-a demon or something i stopped caring-a ques ion the answer can only be rented out of someone with the energy of their death and the priest watch in what appears to be vague annoyance as a man is strung up and hung and they ask his thrashing dying body out of stars
this movie is just bad bad bad bad now that i've gotten that out of the way i feel better this movie is poor from beginning to end the story is lame the segment is really bad freddy is at his cartoon character worst thank god they killed him off and who wants to see roseanne and tom arnold only good thing in the movie is the little bit of backstory that we're given on freddy we see he once had a family and we get to see his abusive alcoholic father than that all bad there are some quality actors in here zane and yaphet kotto and they do their best but the end result is just so bad the hour and a half i spent watching this movie is and hour and half i can't ever get back
the bat people is a really bad film that deserved the treatment just as well like that other film the creeping it we are in some sort of mountainous terrain full of bats we see many things happen like bats flying out and attacking and stuff station wagon chases mishaps at the emergency room and much more all this plus the cheesy mediocrity of the think mitchell here making the bat people actually one of the very best of the last mystery science theater episodes made in the series moviewise awful it should be avoided like the plague unless tom servo and crow are watching with bat people more like the bad people of course
the old axiom that bored people are boring people is well demonstrated in women in love the script taken from d h novel contains an endless flow of concepts that are at best a pity so much effort went into so vacuous an exercise what an empty array of characters given such attention in spite of high production values this film comes across as tedious as its revisit in merely confirms a impression of juvenille minds in adult bodies dawdling nowhere and fumbling every step of the way
terrible movie nuff lines are just filler the movie was bad why i have to expand on that i don't know this is already a waste of my time i just wanted to warn others avoid this movie the acting sucks and the writing is just moronic bad in every way the only nice thing about the movie are deniz breasts even that was ruined though by a terrible and unneeded rape scene the movie is a poorly contrived and totally unbelievable piece of now i am just going to rag on imdb for this stupid rule of lines of text minimum first i waste my time watching this offal then feeling compelled to warn others i create an account with imdb only to discover that i have to write a friggen essay on the film just to express how bad i think it is totally unnecessary
and not in a fun-to-watch way just bad shocking that people have posted positive things about it here the story sucks the acting is bad not scary the special effects aren't no the blackboard has hands coming out of it oh mirror turned into water the hair clothes and makeup in the scenes aren't accurate and they got a middle-aged man with a receding hairline to play the high-school version of himself this is like later-on nightmare on elm street stuff i enjoy sitting down to watch a cheesy horror movie as much as anyone else but there are better bad ones out there to choose from
i enjoyed the feel of the opening few minutes but in i was liberally applying the fast-forward button far too many shots of stewart zelniker walking from room to room down hallways through doors and down the street and as many shots of him looking pensive and confused gave me the impression that the story had originally been meant as a short minutes and then stretched into a feature as a labour of love between director grieve and star zelniker co-wrote the might have been more entertaining if any of the characters had anything to say that i hadn't heard said in many other films before or if the ending wasn't disappointingly the one i had predicted three minutes into the film for an studio film at least its heart was in the right place it wasn't your standard formulaic hollywood manipulative nonsense
greg davis and bryan daly take some crazed statements by a terrorists add some commentary by a bunch of uber-right reactionaries ascribe the most extreme positions of the most fundamentalist moslems on the planet to everyone who calls themselves a moslem and presents this as the theology of islam maybe their next film will involve interviewing fred phelps and the congregation of the westboro baptist church adding commentary by some militant atheist scholars and call their film what the world needs to know about christianity ultimately this film suffers from both poor production values and lack of attention to the most basic standards of journalism don't waste your time and money just turn on your am radio and listen to rush limbaugh for a couple of days for free and you'll get the same message with the same level of intellectual analysis
and ugly this film didn't even seem to entertain the kids in the audience except for one fairly amusing toilet joke christopher lloyd is way past his prime and actually quite tiresome in this role although the sorry excuse for jokes by the writers don't help elizabeth hurley is embarrassingly amateurish in a supposedly comic role jeff daniels and darryl hannah avoid humiliation there is really no reason to make this movie especially since it is unavoidable that one will compare it with robin often brilliant improvisations in mork
michael keaton has really never been a good actor in the tim burton batman movies he always falls in the shadows of his great villains here he stars as a widowed husband that picks up radio frequencies that seems like is dead people that tries making contact with the this is supposed to be a pretty shocking thriller but it really misses about every spot there is shocking you because way too much stuff that ends up unexplained undiscovered and uninteresting so the shocking excitement when it all gets so bad movie made in the first place that white noise makes a fool out of itself truly bad acting and horrifying edited this movie is nothing to watch michael keaton tries making a thriller comeback but ends up missing the target more than ever
this series is one of the worst shows i have ever seen terrible acting terrible effects terrible writing you get my drift the stories are so far from the legend of robin hood amazing looks like they just wanted to use the name robin hood to attract an audience it might as well have been called new adventures of mr bland commented before me that if you had imagination you'd love this show that is a horrible approach to a tv-series a visual media like this should spark your imagination you shouldn't have to force your imagination into something to make it good that would be like the simpsons episode where they try to brainwash homer with a religious propaganda movie and he starts talking about who killed who or whatever if a movie is boring i just make up my own conclusion absolute human waste
there is a word for this sort of film and that word is drivel it was drivel when it was a vhs rental and drivel on satellite re-runs might fool you because it has moderately well-known names in kistofferson and henriksen reasonable soundtrack music and nice monument valley also has some curly haired woman who fights a all you want from a movie then maybe this will keep you still drivel though
i don't understand the positive comments made about this film it is cheap and nasty on all levels and i cannot understand how it ever got characters abound foul-mouthed alcoholic layabout irish father being a prime example none of the characters are remotely sympathetic except briefly for asian boyfriend but even he then turns out to be capable of domestic violence as desperately unattractive as they both are i've no idea why either rita sue would throw themselves at a consummate creep like bob but given that they do why should i be expected to care what happens to them so many reviews keep carping on about how realistic it is if that is true it is a sad reflection on society but no reason to put it on didn't like the film at all
this is the kind of movie that my enemies content i watch all the time but not bloody true i only watch it once in a while to make sure that as bad as i first thought it kind of mobsters hijack a boeing at least is an improvement over having boeing hijack a good part of the pentagon the airplane goes down in the bermuda triangle and sinks pressurized to the bottoms a kind of post-facto has one of those all-star casts the stars either falling or barely above the on our own says pilot jack lemon he is so right except for george kennedy in all these disaster another movie instead oh not airport the original no good either instead watch a decent flick about stuck airplanes like flight of the phoenix
this movie started out good i felt like i was watching an adult version of seinfeld much to quickly i started questioning the situations and actions of the main characters and found no answers to why they were doing what they were doing all the acting was superb but only a few scenes had brief moments where they were actually funny dan cortese was amazing i loved him in this role his agent should show this movie to casting agents watch the first few scenes and then find something better or else you will find yourself totally lost in this mess i found this in a bin at a video store it cost me two dollars and due to the rareness of this movie i feel like it was a good price
deep sh is more like it the eels are just cartooned in over the film think the incredible mr limpet meets leviathan very character or relationship development so called romantic scenes very corny and predictable an interesting idea but a poorly written script and lousy special effects make this a definite must-miss
yet another insult and slap in the face to gay men everywhere this lame attempt at a comedy has nothing to recommend it once again we have an attractive straight hero who supposedly can't get any woman to be interested in him yeah right and we're also presented with the sympathetic attractive gay friend who is actually a fat balding ugly old man whom the lead is supposed to find attractive even i didn't find him appealing and i'm a fat ugly old gay man thankfully not balding whatever acting talent there may be here has been thrown away on a bad script and truly awful direction mr sneedeker should be banned from filmdom but then no different than the countless other hacks working in hollyweed
this movie proves that good acting comes from good direction and this does not happen in ask the dust colin farrell is usually a fine actor but in this he is juvenile donald sutherland comes across as an amateur why because the script is awful the adaptation is awful and the actors seem bored and half hearted the atmosphere of the movie is bad i could only think when it would finish and i turned it off half way the director has done a very poor job and even though i have not read the novel it is certainly a missed chance the atmosphere this film is trying to evoke and the message and storyline never reaches the audience in one word it is a terrible film
this movie only got a because you can't give a zero if you have a weak tummy at all don't watch animal rights people you don't want to watch either it makes people vegetarians i swear i witnessed it happen the only cool parts are the case and the fact that its a true story its really really super creepy that this guy worked at adt while he killed people still feel safe when you punch in that little code i don't he had access to every code in kansas i hated the movie it was not scary it was mentally scaring do your self a favor and this movie i think it cost about to make that includes their over paid actors
wow probable the worst movie i have ever seen this person should never make another cant believe anyone would have produce this in good have have wasted every cent no concept of real life i have wasted hours of my life i will never get back ever everyone who worked on this show should be embarrassed i'm embarrassed for them all of you should be ashamed if i was gay i would want to tell the director that they have personally set back gay rights progress by years please never watch this have never written a blogg about a film before but the distaste for this film has compelled me to do so
this is a terrible production of bartleby though not as the other reviewer put it because it is unfilmable but rather because this version does not maintain the spirit of the book it tells the story almost painfully so watching it i could turn the pages in my book and follow along which is not as much fun when dealing with an adaptation rather see the version of bartleby featuring crispin glover that version while humorous brings new details to the film while maintaining the spirit of the novel important is the spirit not the minutiae of things like setting character names and costumes the difference between these film versions is like night and day tedious and hilarious this version is a lesson as to what can go wrong if an adaptation is handled poorly painful mind-numbing schlock
the first half was ok but the last half really really disappointed funny the producers even admitted they didn't have a clue for the ending and it really showed whats really sad is i have to write ten lines of comment minimum to be able to post this i really didn't want to include spoilers to qualify my remarks since the show isn't really worth that effort when battlestar galatica first came out i was really excited with the prospect of a better remake it didn't happen that first season border on being space porn they eventually cleaned it up a bit and actually had some pretty fair drama so i started watching again but to end the series with kara being a cyclon god angel same with baltar and six was pretty dumb
this guy has no idea of cinema okay it seems he made a few interestig theater shows in his youth and about two acceptable movies that had success more of political reasons cause they tricked the communist censorship this all is very good but look carefully he does not know his job the scenes are unbalanced without proper start and and with a disordered content and full of emptiness he has nothing to say about the subject so he over-licitates with violence nakedness and gutter language how is it possible to keep alive such a rotten corpse who never understood anything of cinematographic profession and art why don't they let him succumb in piece
i've seen some bad things in my time a half dead cow trying to get out of waist high mud a head on collision between two cars a thousand plates smashing on a kitchen floor human beings living like never in my life have i seen anything as bad as the cat in the film is worse than worse than hitler worse than vllad the impaler worse than people who put kittens in is the most disturbing film of all time used to think it was a joke some elaborate joke and that mike myers was maybe a high cocaine sniffing drug addled betting junkie who lost a bet or shudder
not since caligula have i considered turning off the movie half-way then with this one i was only minutes in when i considered unfortunately i did make it all the way through make sure that you do not that cradle of fear is shocking or gory or scary or frightening or sexual that not any of those things yet it so desperately wants to be all of them instead boring trite ordinary predictable and unexceptionally poorly executed on video high school special effects no sense of even basic visual storytelling dialog barely that worth hearing movie is proof for the argument that even the straight-to-video distributors need to draw a line in the sand somewhere
in tobias schneerbaum disappeared in the peruvian amazon one year later he walked out of the it took him years to go back supposedly keep the river on your right is a modern cannibal tale in reality anyone looking for some insight into cannibalism will be sadly disappointed the first half of the movie is more like a travel log of new ginuea mostly touting the native art the second half relies on still photos of a peruvian cannibal tribe but really about it unless of course you are interested in home movies of a jewish wedding or schneerbaum introducing his former male lovers i give up big disappointment and not really a modern cannibal tale merk
i almost called hbo and demanded my money back for the month just because they've been airing this movie i can just see the movie execs sitting around going okay we need to come up with something just like home alone only we'll add a bunch of cash for the kid hire cut-rate actors and oh yeah we'll make it a lot less maybe not the last part but basically what you've got here not even worth seeing if someone else rents it and as a movie for kids forget it i wouldn't let my kids see this not necessarily because of bad-taste jokes but because i wouldn't want them to say what were you thinking showing us that lame piece of garbage dad
i rented this movie yesterday and can hardly express my disappointment in little laura ingalls for getting involved in something so poorly produced i am not sure if it was horrible writing or bad directing or both but it leaves a viewer very disappointed in having wasted the time to watch this swill it consisted of a weak naive story line very poor lines and relied solely on pretty scenery and pretty people to sell it unfortunately this was not enough you would be better off to rent a tape full of static than to waste your time on this crap lindsey wagner also played a pretty pathetic part as a ranch owner who apparently works very hard doing nothing anybody who has ever been near a ranch knows that this was obviously written by a young person from los angeles and not someone with much knowledge of the world
yeah pretty sure i saw this movie years ago when it was about the recycled storyline glitzed up hollywood-style borrowing scripts from better making-it-in-the-music-industry original make-up glammier costumes and choreography more money for the questionably talented beyonce you like the throwback style you should appreciate actual groups who struggled having digitized voices and a hollywood involvement makes this hypocritical garbage
i usually like comedy movies i really enjoy them but i don't really get the point of envy i mean it has a dull and not really the acting is generally good not enough for the movie to get at least a bit interesting stiller and black don't show all their talent in this if you're about to rent a comedy i suggest you definitely don't go for this one unless you want to get bored and i can see i'm not the only one with this opinion because even jack black apologized for it a look at trivia
hippie past was a revelation but overall this felt like crashing a wake campfire stories work best around the intimacy of a campfire there were just too many semi-boring old friends anecdotes and too much filler stock footage i love the clash and joe for not reuniting and selling their songs until now mick jones but this doc left me relate more using campfire storytellers without proper explanation of who is telling the anecdote alienates the viewer to some extent they should have been interviewed on their own even using radio dj voice did little to glue the film together and can someone explain all the flags flying behind the campfire scenes after the awesome filth and the fury i hoped temple could deliver a joe strummer doc deserves better
this movie is once again one of those movies that someone thinks or tries to make others think that they understood it anyone who tries to make any sense of this is a moron my advise would be to take two not one but two hits of very strong acid and at least you'll get a visual thrill out of it although at the end you may kill yourself for wasting your acid being that this comment requires lines of info let me write something for those of you that will try to defend the movie unintelligble garbage schitzoid waste of talent movie is ice with paper on destination with ringing clouds on a sunny dive in the pudding sounds like lion in a red light with seeing hair now explain that to me
i thought they should have called this movie whites instead of heights kind of film that makes people hate new yorkers people who are so self obsessed and think their lives are so me a break such a lily white cast that glenn close was the most ethnic character in it this film was crying out for someone real to come in and steal so they introduce get this a character even whiter than the rest of the cast thought he was an albino at supposed to be still trying to decipher that accent intellectually movie is the kind of film able to fool so many people into thinking worthwhile because it has the trappings of something more ambitious better to fill the theaters with than with this pretentious have been a better play because you can't fall off the floor
what a horrible movie i cannot believe i wasted mins of my life watching this re-make please tell me why ving rhames and mehki pfifer starred in this film mehki pfifer is great in and ving rhames probably didn't know what he was doing i feel terrible for them the music background i must say did not fit at alllll with the story and amazing how you can find these directors who have absolutely no lives in creating a well and balanced film i hope that in the future no director as horrible as this one was could ever distroy such a great classic film this film should not have been made in the first place an advice to everyone who has seen it please tell me that i'm right because i couldn't possibly be the only viewer who did not enjoy out of
this has got to go down as almost one of the worst movies of all time awful acting awful script and they were the good points one to definitely miss the jokes if you could call them that were so predictable as to be pathetic pamela anderson is still relying on her body to detract from the fact that her acting is just as plastic i sat willing to give it a chance hoping that it was going to improve which alas it didn't if it was a choice between this and a book i suggest you settle down for a good read i like denise richards which is why i gave this movie a go but why she has let her self be cast in this movie is beyond me
i paid one dollar for this dvd and at first i was feeling ripped off but then i started thinking about it and i should be grateful i have found a holy grail a real touchstone of bad cinema if you think the opening dramatic shots of an empty stadium successfully fizzle with awkward camera address monologue then wait until the opening credits roll on the butt the script seems to be pasted together from press clippings and esl textbooks but i just can't believe how bad george hamilton is he seems to have absolutely no connection to anything he says the only internal monologue i can detect is gosh i bet they think i am cute really cute this is an epiphany i now know how bad it can get
badly made dreadful acting and an ending that the director appeared to contrive out of nowhere as the film had frankly been nothing short of dull shocking that this film is considered for an award at the gij√≥n film that came out of the theatre was of the same opinion as i what was the point of even making the film the references to iraq were either bizarre or just not thought through properly i am astonished that this film has been given a release very very disappointing and a waste of my time sorry terribly negative review but hopefully will deter some people from making the same mistake what a pity we did not have a q and a at the end of the film now that could have been interesting
life is really too short for movies like this i knew it couldn't be good when i realized what i'd already suspected that david schwimmer would be playing the exact same type of person he plays in face it either the guy can't play anything but a nerd or he is never offered any other parts i have a feeling that a mixture of i have to say that it is extremely difficult to like a movie that utterly wastes the considerable talents of gwyneth paltrow barbara hershey toni collette and carol kane
while most of the movie is very amateurish the kosher slaughter scene is played up but not untrue kosher law says that an animal must be conscious when the blade touches skin the kosher slaughter scene is accurate as anyone knows who has seen one or has seen the peta film showing a kosher slaughter in which the animals throat is cut and the esophagus cut out while it is still alive conscious and obviously suffering we must remember that history is written by the victors is one even allowed to even think that maybe the nazis were it say anything that the nazis had outlawed this vicious religious slaughter and the jews are still practicing it even today
i just finished watching going overboard i have to say that we should send every copy of this film to iraq and make them watch i even tried to get a blind women to watch this and she turned it off in like min adam sandler could not find a better project than this as for the writing if thats what you want to call it those responsible should be forced to watch this movie forever in hell i believe that somewhere i read that the budget for this film was and they were way under did wallmart get a good deal on this every store has a big huge bin of this crap sitting on the sales floor the only good thing about this movie is you can use the dvd as a coaster or trade it to a friend but then they might not be your friend anymore
i'm glad i rented this movie for one reason its shortcomings made me want to read book and get the full story the movie is beautiful the period is depicted well and consistently the best of my knowledge and meryl and glenn do good this is the worst acting job i've ever seen from jeremy kept wondering if something was wrong with his mouth i hate the terribly english way he says transito winona ryder does nothing believable except look young and idealistic most of the other performances are ok but so few things hang together in the character arcs and the relationship development that i was frustrated and angry well before the end very curious now whether this movie is typical of bille work i may have to drop another couple of bucks to rent sense of snow
i saw this on cable recently and kinda enjoyed it i've been reading the comments here and it seems that everyone likes the second half more than the first half personally i enjoyed the first story bad that wasn't extended the second story i thought was cliched and that california dreaming if i hear that one more time chungking express is alright but not something that mainstream audiences will catch on to see like crouching tiger
i love horror movies i can even appreciate most cheese it out of horror films these days are cheese but this was just ridiculous terrible acting terrible writing completely hollow and unbelievable characters meisner actors here and a total lack of sufficient body count i wish i could salvage the minutes of my life i just wasted at least the crook brothers are aptly named the only good thing about the whole film was watching the alicia silverstone wanna-be get punched in the face how this ever made it to sundance is completely baffling to me most of the plot was absolutely unrealistic even by slasher film standards i mean come on who would rush out to get a cheap earring seconds after a creepy stalker guy just left their doorstep lame
the guy who wrote directed and stared in this shocking piece of trash should really consider a carer change yes rob stefaniuk i mean you seriously who funded this crap there are so many talented writers out there whom money could be better spent on i think the idea is great but the acting script and directing is just plain awful the jokes are so not funny i understand that they are supposed to be taking the mickey but do it with style this movie is screaming saturday night live skits why i say again why do studios give money to hacks like rob stefaniuk never give a comedian the opportunity to write direct and star in his own movie duh
are you kidding that was awful that notwithstanding i got given this film and others and they were all on dvd the film starts of pretty much an ok movie but goes downhill from about the middle the ending well just say it was one of the most anti climatic endings in recent film history lots of gore in the end sequence and if you like a dose of schlock horror then this is the film for
i've always thought that cinderella ii was the worst movie i've ever seen by peter pan and some other sequels like the lion king and the hunchback of notre dame all these movies are made with the same idea because the movie has no plot they try to make up for that by filling it with jokes i'm not saying the jokes are bad but they make up most of the movie the first time i saw the movie i would have given it a but now i think about it most kids don't care how good the original movie was they just care that the movie is entertaining i still think the movie was a bad sequel but that doesn't mean horrible now i think it deserves a
this is an art film that was either made in or national film preservation foundation says and imdb says regardless of the exact date the film definitely appears to be very indicative of this general time some camera-work and pop art stylings that are pure late film consists of three simple images that are distorted using different weird camera tricks these distorted images are accompanied by music and there is absolutely no dialog or plot of any sort this was obviously intended as almost like a form of performance art and like most performance art interesting at first but quickly becomes tiresome the film to put it even more bluntly is a total bore and would appeal to no one but perhaps those who made the film their family and friends and perhaps a few people just too hip and with it to be understood by us mortals
i have seen a lot of stupid movies in my life a lot but this is without a doubt the worst one ever i usually like dumb movies if they are somewhat entertaining but i can't even think of one good thing about this movie i like teen witch for sake but has horrible acting lame porn music throughout the whole thing and even the sex scenes sucked i would have to compare the lameness of this movie to the likes of twin dragons puppet master vs the demonic toys or even a very brady sequel although this is by far worse then any of those i beg you don't even waste your time believe me its hours you'll never get back
whoever thought that another home alone film would be a good idea should have their head examined same plot different kid more villains leads to more endless stupidity in the traps the other two films were bad enough and this is where it hits rock bottom people may as well watch the other films for plot as all identical
minimal script minimal character development minimal steady camera maximum stretched scenes maximum headache inducing jerky zooms maximum characters walking around in the woods doing nothing up until the time flashes on the screen of you can fast forward and miss nothing since there are three hunters who we know nothing about doing nothing to be fair the movie does have some string music that was interesting so perhaps a music video would have been the way to go with this unfortunately that was not to be and what should have been a twenty minute short is stretched beyond belief forget about trigger man i know i am trying to merk
oh my thought cbs primetime television shows were things gerald mcraney appeared people are experimented on by a crazed mind it don't rent saw this under one of its many grey matter and it one of the worst films of recent memory the are right it is awful never have so many appeared onscreen never the cast is awful the awful and the script is awful i cannot stress how awful this is it like you would is rated for physical violence some gun violence some profanity and some adult situations
tired cliched wants to be basic instinct but misses opportunity after opportunity for fresh perspectives new insights insipid trite grotesque and without the possibly-redeeming value of brevity oh was only minutes must have just a lot longer i'd rather clean bus station toilets with my toothbrush than have to sit through this again i'm expressing an opinion here i guess this means i didn't like it
ok honestly i dont see why everybody thinks this is so great its really not there were two good things that came out of this movie performance he was very good i can tip my hat for him performance he was good no other then that it got pretty stupid and what was stanley kubrick thinking drafting shelly as the wendy she was so bad she looked the same every time she got scared the problem with this movie was the ending i would have had more respect for it if kubrick would have ended it differently and the over all movie was just stupid the problem with the movie is that the book was so much better so dont see the movie read the book and you will be much better off
well one has to give the director credit for how gutsy he was gutsy would be the right term not only did he use a total cast of five people extras at all but he also decided to use sub-par special effects with a confusing and boring plot he also and i am not kidding put a warning at the beginning of the movie that you might die of fright however they do promise a freeeeee coooofffffffiiiiinnnnn to have a creepy limping gardener is always a good move you watch mystery science theater you might've seen this they like to showcase horrible movies just to let you good gift for someone you hate
while the acting and directing could be argued as having some merit the storyline is a very poor wannabe vietnam movie with the country name simply the very least for a movie to hold some credibility try and have some semblance of accuracy in equipment weapons and tactics nevermind the gross misrepresentation of the behaviour of the troops as a for the limited use as silly propaganda about the south african defence force it serves little purpose definitely no entertainment movie makers this is how not to make a war movie do some research and have some pride in your product
well what i can say about this movie is that great to see so many asian faces what i didn't like about the film was that it was full of stereotypes of what typical racial characters would do in their role the asian girl without confidence who has to play someone else to get ahead the white guy infatuated with asian culture and chooses to leave his white world behind for the land of yellow and the keeping it real black cab driver plus all the coke shanghai tang and dunkin donuts product placement was a bit too obvious the story plot itself was fun but pretty much how i thought the story would unravel then again when watching romantic comedies you can't expect much but then again i would have been wanted to just be surprised at least once the parents are the best part of the flick
a real blow-up of the film literally this british film is boringly an exciting plot a terrorist places bombs on a train how could the writers and producers of this stinker turn this into such a dull ford as the expert called upon to defuse the bomb is given awful writing material to work with naturally just as he is called in his wife anne vernon is about to leave him no wonder we never heard of miss vernon after such a film it would be enough to end her elderly man who loved trains and interferes is our version of senile dementia i thought it was highly insulting to show this man even at the end
shamefull as it may be this movie actually made it to the videomarket bringing shame on my proud country any attempt to watch this movie without stopping or pausing will be a fruitless attempt one cannot bear to see more than one hour of this then having either fallen asleep or visited the bathroom for if you haven't seen anything else from denmark please remember things were never meant to be but still some idiot goes ahead and makes it anyway
role as the kahn brings to mind bob barker the price is right running a country the same way he runs his show but lots more to chuckle and snort through in this turkey kurt thomas as the baby-faced hero displays some considerable acrobatic skills but not a whit of acting talent whatsoever a few spooky moments the village of crazies mostly and some mildly impressive martial arts sequences but any given ninja movie will give you much more entertainment and you won't feel as guilty about laughing
watching josh kornbluth act in this movie reminds me of my freshman tv production class where the not funny had the chance to prove just how unfunny they really is the word that comes to mind when i try to synopsize this wannabe comedy the jokes are sophomoric and telegraphed the delivery is painfully bad ouch the writing is simply dorkish it is akin to a bob saget show this movie is as painful as watching a one and a half hour long saturday night live skit belushi hated this movie and want my money back
this film makes american pie a sophisticated movie no further comment needed humor is cheap dialogues are stupid and the cast is awkward every clich√© is used several times without any original twist and far the worst the movie turns out to be more catholic than the pope so sad
you gotta love the cheesy low budget movies this one comes complete with bad effects props and bad acting bad plus every time i see mercedes mcnab sister i keep thinking watch out a for those that know perfect example of what happens when someone with bad taste and wants to waste money making a flick the little that was spent of course i don't know if i feel more sorry for the writer of the movie or the producer who didn't make back any say good for little kids in simplicity but i don't know if i'd want to subject a kid to because the lowest it will go
horrible ending and i can't believe moore spent a year coming up with it smacks of l ron hubbard and dianetitcs which hubbard claimed to pen in just three weeks this was actually disappointing enough for me to toss my discs from the first years now the first hours were action packed though absurd in the premise and then it deteriorated into a slow painful sophomoric dissolution of the series unbelievable how slow and drawn out that last hour was were we to think more deeply if i wanted a lesson in a-materialism i would reread daniel ishmael absurd to think people would give up everything for a fresh start absurd to throw in a disappearing kara and a reappearing baltar and six absurd to throw in the mitochondrial eve just absurd
a one is the highest rating i could have given this movie considering zero and negative numbers are not allowed pee yew pointless mess of a movie with a lot of wasted b-list actors who have done better work written and directed by some guy with the mentality of a twelve year old who smirks and giggles at stupid puns and poop and fart jokes for example gene from all in the family character telling marilu character that she swings both ways sexually was a cheap attempt at humor indicative of the general lameness of the movie you want good cheeky humor rent animal house american pie one only old school or office space
this film makes you really appreciate the invention of the fast forward button on your remote control exquisite boredom in beautiful pictures for once hamilton goes relatively easy on soft focus shots however what i found hard to take about the film was that although anja sch√ºte was about when it was shot the girls are portrayed as much younger than they actually are this whole lolita thing especially as there is an older man involved leaves me rather uneasy the heroine is actually shaved in the pubic area in order to make her look even younger than she is come on sex is a nice past between consenting adults another thing i found odd was that neither beart nor sch√ºte have a nude scene in the film well not a proper one at least
the power rangers is definitely the worst television show and completely ridiculous plastic toy line in the history of the united is absolutely nothing even remotely entertaining about this completely awful television is simply the worst show ever made with awful actors dressing up in multi colored spandex outfits that look completely owners of this show should be ashamed of themselves since there is no redeeming value to this of today should try watching better shows like the toy story movies instead of this garbage
this movie was very very mediocre and very very gory everyone left their acting lessons at home and totally forgot how to act i mean it was so bad and had no real plot and kindergarteners could have written a better story plot wait what story plot not at all scary
with this movie only running minutes and nothing all that good on television i decided to pop revolt of the zombies into the dvd to pass the time even while realizing the era from which it was coming i was sorely disappointed it started with the oddly upbeat quality of the opening score no brooding music and then the rather slow moving opening sequences gosh i figured a movie about zombies even from the would have some chills to it zombie with bela lugosi certainly did but this had none zero it was scarcely even dramatic for the few moments with the burning eyes superimposed on the film to indicate the mesmerization of someone like the equally dull king of the zombies this movie may be an interesting curiosity to own but nothing more
you might be tempted to rent this film because peter sellers appears in it that would be a mistake this is one of the most pointless films ever made i kept waiting for something funny to happen but nothing funny appears in this movie even the film industry recognized this was a very weak film and didn't even try to promote it its a wonder that it was ever put on wonder what sort of contract caused sellers to be in this film i also wonder why the people responsible for this film were allowed to go on to make other bad films surely this film is a waste of the money used to create it and a waste of time watching it surely there are high school students who would be able to a film which as a plot
this is one of the most boring movies i have ever seen its horrible christopher lee is good but he is hardly in it the only the good part is the opening be fooled by the title end of the world is truly a bad movie i stopped watching it close to the end it was so bad only for die hard b-movie fans that have the brain to stand this vomit
this was a disappointing movie considering the life is always good for a the stars this movie should have been a fall down laughfest it was worth a couple of chuckles at best steve martin has been much funnier than this and it appears that dan ackroyd should stick to dramatic roles where he might follow robin williams lead and someday win an oscar
my daughter alexandra thought it was very boring and i thought it was just a repeat of stuff from dalmatians i couldn't wait for the movie to end the best part was the credits at the beginning they were cute and well done the rest of the film is not worth watching thank you
well i had to be generous and give this a this was mainly due to the gratuitous holes cut in that shirt where her breasts are i found that mildly amusing other than that this movie does nothing more than provide a few good laughs with a friend funny if you're willing to throw mystery science theatre comments at it with someone but it ain't no better than a and a pretty much sucks
i was disappointed the film was a bit predictable and did not live up to the hype plastered all over the box having said that the characters were well developed the windego myth was used in a unique premise and the house was pretty spooky but it just missed for me i kept waiting for that big ahhhhh or boo but it never the movie was plagued with poor filming of poor special effects thus showing to much of a bad thing and not using atmosphere and viewer imagination to create the horror and suspense try movies like session or the cube if your looking for a low-budget but well conceived horror movie
this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen the plot is awful and the acting is worse the jokes that are attempted absolutley suck don't bother to waste your time on a dumb movie such as this and if for some reason that you do want to see this movie don't watch it with your parents
in the future of freddy is after the last surviving teenager of elm street forsaking any scares whatsoever for unfunny attempts at humor and needless celebrity cameos tom arnold wtf this is tied with part is the worst the demon child rapist ever got wow was this a piece of crap not even the great legendary alice cooper could make the stench of this movie go away and when they hell did freddy ever have a daughter the whole film is severely retarded in ever single conceivable way shape form rachel talalay you stink to high heaven grade extras cast and crew bios jump to the sequence and jump to a nightmare options extras for the film can be found on the seventh disc of the nightmare collection dvd set content trivia game screenplay and web link
broad enough for you wait till you see this heavy of a little collegiate one act what is shocking and wild rarely holds up over time and this is proof to take on church with broadside humor just isn't shocking or funny kind of boring the performers are giving all they've got but basically a play that up to film well not a lot of fun
i like animated shows i enjoy the nick fare pretty much including hey arnold but moving a tv show to the big screen isn't easy and this just didn't feel big enough it was more like a long episode of the show and it just didn't move along that well judging by the behavior of the kids we had with us it didn't score that well with them either
this is quite literally the worst movie i have ever watched in my life it may be the worst movie possible some movies are so bad that they're good this movie is so bad that it goes past enjoyable camp and simply becomes unwatchably awful it is the anti-enantiodromia we bought it with the intent to heckle and all of my family gathered around for a fun evening of clever remarks instead we sat in stunned silence pitying poor peter is worse than the animated lord of the rings it is worse than the matrix sequels it is worse than krull it is worse than any batman not under any circumstances let this movie approach within ten feet of your television
i still can't believe how bad this movie was if i wasn't a massochist i don't know if i would have survived the viewing it looks like it cost about to make but it wasn't the money that brought them down the acting was horrid not just bad graders could have read the lines better second the only other reason to watch this kind of movie is the skin and that is sorely lacking in this flick we don't even get to see the more attractive chicas in the buff well better luck next time eh
words can't describe how utterly stupid this story therefore bad this movie is basinger del toro what were you thinking so a mall and its parking space is totally full character goes in to buy a cup of tea and some packaging she comes out the whole place is so empty that nobody hears two gunshots fired nearby even though she lives there when she drives away from the baddies she goes to the most remote and godforsaken place possible instead of the nearest police station or at least a crowded place come on i won't even go into the infamous red toolbox since other people have done that before let alone how she kills the moronic thugs one by is so stupid without the least bit of logic i can only warn you watching it a total waste of time honestly
forget plan this is the ultimate fiasco a costume drama ineptly directed scripted acted etc this film is based on isabel not-so-much-better novel i hate meryl streep and antonio banderas non-spanish films and the other actors including winona my favourite actress and jeremy irons try hard to get over such a terrible script plenty of mistakes for example since when does it snow in xmas in chile and very cruel with tons of that evil named magic realism this stands out as the worst movie of all time it totally sucks
i watched envy two nights ago on dvd at a friends house the premise of this film is quite promising jack black and ben stiller in a comedy with a lot of potential but it completely fails to deliver i watched it with about five friends and no-one laughed for the entire film the jokes are few and far between are not funny in any way the story line is crap and they never answer the question where does the go of course the answer to that is no one cares this film lacks any sort of comedy value and as a few other users have said the only thing that makes it even almost worth watching is christopher walken as the j-man none of the characters are developed the plots so thin nearly transparent and is that song throughout the film supposed to be funny
i'll just put it out here that was the worst sequel to a classic disney film i've ever seen in disney released what i hail as one of his greatest films of all time now take away the great songs add a poor plot that resembles that of a lost tv show put it together and what do you get the biggest load of crud i've ever seen after i saw this i thought it was all over for disney cinderella should've ended with and they lived happily ever after not this garbage this film did not deserve a sequel like this i thought it would be like a twist in time which was moderate but better than this also what do we care of anastasia she switched sides like iago did but it didn't help anyone
the year was when shirley temple played three major movies and really began to make a name for herself unfortunately the studios had to experiment to see what the public best liked about here two of those things were singing and dancing another was a short interesting film that kept attention and got their minds off the depression you know the other keys to successful film achieved none of the above despite the star presences of gary cooper and carole lombard and despite a very good director in henry hathaway in addition there are too many talky parts in here which become simply boring and too many arguments between a sullen lombard and cooper to top it off you didn't get the normal feel-good ending which is what the public wants i guess they learned after this movie
i saw this film awhile back working on a trailer for the production company and it was terrible hewitt is mediocre at best hopkins phones his performance in still blows away hewitt in their scenes together and alec looks bored trust me on this you should avoid this film like the plague if it ever gets released it seems to go on forever as the tired plot unfolds at a pace it is relentlessly unfunny the cinematography is crappy and the direction is pedestrian alec baldwin should go to film school if he plans to direct again in terms of his acting his character is totally unlikable which makes it impossible to root for him dan ackroyd is pretty funny and the surprising makeup of the jury near the end is cute but this film is just plain awful
hey look deal with it there are much better portrayals of the hardship of black america than this although i think this story is weak my criticism is focused on the poor execution of the story which i have mentioned was made in the and is horrible in the department funny to see oprah as a latter-day crack-whore scene where bigger stuffs elizabeth mcgovern into the incinerator pure classic cinema first off i don't care how drunk you are you will react to degree flame matter how bad your acting but they really milked that was comical i'll tell you what though i had great satisfaction in seeing elizabeth mcgovern burn in a faux death she annoys me
this film is stale and misses the mark it is far off compared to the batman that it tries to coppy that women singer whats her name can not act and we see why her film carrier died notice how this film died in the box office no one see this film on tv either my uncle and dad were expecting batman and the films impression is more like cop rock not worth renting
this movie was absolutly awful i can't think of one thing good about it the plot holes were so huge you could drive a hummer through them the acting was soo stuningly bad that even jean claude should be ashamed and that is saying alot and dialogue what think that i was a fan of the first one use that comment loosely its more like a guilty pleasure than anything else this movie had goldberg in it for crying out loud nothing good can come of this movie what makes this film even worse is that it is soo bad you can't even watch it with a bunch of friends to make fun of this has got to be in my top five worst movies of all time because it is soo hard for me to give a
don't waste minutes of your time on fast food fast women annoyingly episodic script with three story lines patched together is laughably bad due to predictable writing horrific acting and even bad music i found the anorexic main character upsetting to watch every time she was on screen she needs the fast the minutes you'd devote to this turkey doing something more trimming your toenails you'd have more entertainment only redeeming thing about this film is louise lasser but she deserves much better than this tired script as impotent as the elder guy she courts in the beware
penn takes the time to develop his characters and we almost care about them however there are some real problems with the story here we see no real motivation for the evil behavior and the time line is screwed up supposedly set in the music is late the references and dialogue is the potential for a powerful climax presents itself and penn allows it to slip away but even with all these difficulties it is worth the watch but not great
did anyone read the script this has to be some of the worst writing and directing of the entire year three great actors paul giamatti rachel weisz and miranda richardson couldn't pull this one out about two-thirds it looked like giamatti eyes were saying i can't believe i signed the contract not the worst movie i ever saw but on the really really bad christmas movie list not enough lines but what else can be said okay the movie just doesn't move with con-man dialogue his character is just a creepy guy that you just can't get past it was just a lackluster walk through that no one seemed to be able to get into
i am a fan of the previous best of the best films but this one was awful no wonder i had such a hard time finding it i tried video rental stores until i found one with a copy of this movie the acting was terrible the plot was a joke and the action was bad as really miss alex grady travis brigley and the original kickboxing characters and theme that this film had with the first
tv movie about an ancient egyptian curse brought to the us in the during the filming of first version of the commandments and which is reawakened when sets are unearthed in the of the worst films i've seen in a long question is were the filmmakers serious or kidding when they made this film if this is serious its a laughably bad movie and a great film to pick on for its badness if its a comedy its less good but funny for all of the wrong will laugh long and hard at this film probably more than many other hollywood comedies
this isn't the worst movie i've ever seen but i really can't recall when i've seen a worse one i thought this would be about an aircraft accident investigation what it really was is a soap opera and a bad one at that they overplayed the conflict card to the extreme the first hour or so seems like a shouting match with some implausible scenes thrown minute memorial scene requisite black umbrellas and rain to fictitious crash victims was lame and i thought it would never end this one at all costs unless you revel in
a shame that even a talented director desplechin could not muster a decent performance out of a bleakly-talented actress phoenix esther kahn lacks the substance to convey a very concise and clear plot in an attempt to fulfill the concentric circle of an plight the performance and presentation is too contrived and poorly executed to draw any compassion from the viewer in an overly long running time the redundancy of struggle is too melodramatic to be effective and reduces the storyline into a frail frame of a disastrous display the content is incoherent and gratuitous as phoenix struggles to carry out instruction just as esther is supposedly trying to do the same never feeling a convincing victory over pain we never feel a victory in talent
the secret movie blows sorry but it just did this bad riff on i know what you did last summer and scream beth played admirably by dorie barton joins several friends on a spring break trip the group rents a fancy house and tries to enjoy a fun vacation then the deaths begin first one then another then another of the friends is murdered leading to a sad and trite climax with predictable results note dorie barton is the poor reese looks like reese acts like reese and could pass for reese in a police lineup maybe how they cast her anyhoo decent cinematography and fair acting could not quite make up for bad dialog and terrible writing
the producers made a big mistake casting mark lester who couldn't act or sing in the title role aside from his very bad acting all of singing had to be dubbed by a girl i don't know why they cast him at all since there would have been so many boys who could have played the part infinitely better and done their own singing as well shani wallis was far too old to play nancy who was only supposed to be the current west end version is so much better than the movie in every way ross mccormack is the best artful dodger of all time and he is certainly far better looking than jack wild ever was it was clearly political to award this old-fashioned musical so many oscars after the tumultuous events of
this movie makes me think the others i've seen with combs were an accident the plot had more holes than i think i've ever seen in a movie purporting to be something more than a b movie the acting was so laughable that not even the memories of combs past campy triumphs were enough to save it considering the script i have to imagine that there was not enough money in the budget for things like continuity and original ideas i am thoroughly upset that i paid blockbuster prices for this trash the fact that it was made for television was something that would have helped me avoid this atrocity and frankly something that movies this poor should be required to warn you of avoid this movie no matter what
im the type of person who always goes to horror section when i'm picking a film so i picked five across the eyes i was disgusted with this film and thought there was no story line and no point that you could enjoy made my skin crawl to think that people like to watch films that just encourage violence for the hell of it it was low budget and very rubbish i think i could of done better myself i think that it was the worst film i have ever seen in my life and you should not bother to watch it the actors were rubbish the camera was awful the picture was bad and the sound was not up to scratch i think it was a little bit like a cheep rip of off the baler which project and it has not worked at all it was foul
wow this film is truly awful i can't imagine how anyone could have read this badly written script and given it the greenlight the cast is uniformly second rate with some truly horrendous performances from virtually all of the cast the story is disjointed fragmented and incoherent the telling leaden and predictable no wit no charm no humour not sexy in the least the characters remain as flat as the proverbial pancake also a strong current of misogyny which became increasingly hard to stomach as the film went on when your lead is unfunny and unappealing uphill from there despite phony turn-around ending where love triumphs over lust i was left with a sick feeling in my stomach if this is what passes for humour and social comment then we're definitely doomed
the movie was watchable while nicolson was on the screen however i had to fight against passing out from boredom when the film depended on meryl streep to carry scenes without jack she was as bland as could be the relationship between the characters was nothing special these characters have been portrayed before and much better it felt like a based-on-real-life scenario in the absolute worst sense of daily life is boring and not worth writing about or watching why ephron felt her life and relationship with carl bernstein was interesting enough to write about escapes me perhaps she wrote it as therapy for many writers putting an episode from their life on paper is cathartic fine but then why anyone in hollywood felt this story was worth filming remains a mystery to me
getting worse the series is on a serious down fall the first two sequel were acceptable and from then on we have seen a buch of really really terrible movies robert englund gives another great performance as freddy but the rest of the cast can't act the story is alice having survived the previous installment of the nightmare series finds the deadly dreams of freddy krueger starting once again this time the taunting murderer is striking through the sleeping mind of unborn child his intention is to be born again into the real world the only one who can stop freddy is his dead mother but can alice free her spirit in time to save her own son check out the first three miss the next three then watch the last one
the king is dead long live the king the triad of caddie shack two the family underneath the stairs and troop beverly hills had been tied for worst movie ever for so long that they seemed icons in their own right but there is a new hail the new to earth but some things like tiny tim for example are so bad they are good some day this could take out the inimitable rocky horror picture show as a cult film so go see this just take my word for it go see it all hail the new king
this was one of the lamest movies we watched in the last few months with a predictable plot line and pretty bad acting from the supporting characters the interview with hugh laurie on the dvd was actually more rewarding than the film laurie obviously put a lot of effort into learning how to dance the samba but the scope of his character only required that he immerse himself at the kiddie end of the pool the movie is based on the appearance of a lovely girl and great music but these are not sufficient to make good you have never seen rio or the inside of a british bank this film is for you out of
kurt thomas stars as jonathan cabot some kind of a gymnast who trains for a special game which involves being hunted by a group of ninjas but those ninjas won't stand a chance especially since cabot is a gymnast taken as a whole gymkata is one helluva bad movie the atrocious acting the god-awful script and really incompetent directing make the quality below human standards however this movie is so terrible it becomes really really funny i mean with dialog such as i know i'll outsleep them or ha your through only add to the mock value that gymkata more then obtains besides the only movie that has are hero a gymnast who finds things to swing on in the heat of the moment
this was a horrible film i gave it points one for angelina jolie and a second one for the beautiful porsche in the beginning other than that the story just plain sucked and cars racing through cities wasn't so new in the happyend was probably what annoyed me the most seldomly seen anything so constructed
this movie is very very very poor i have seen better movies was a bit of tension but not much to make you jump out of your chair it begins slowly with the building of tension which is not a success at least if you ask me though at some points or moments i must say it was a bit funny when people got shot and how they went should had made it something like scary movie then it might be a better movie because i watched only pieces of the movie by skipping scenes and it got to boring through out the movie i must say that i felt sleepy watching this movie so i sure can say it is not worth waste time on even thinking to do something with this movie besides leaving it where it already is somewhere very dusty
somehow they summed up the ten years that radically changed our country in four hours and what a painful four hours it was they trivilized the major events and happenings and they claimed it was about two families yet you barely saw the african-american family if i were nbc i would be ashamed and embarrassed for airing such trash what was amusing was this happy-go-lucky family you saw in the very beginning was tortured in so many ways but managed to attend every major event through the country and the second family was such a non-factor they devoted maybe five or six scenes total to this family that poor son please nbc do not make any movies about any other that to pbs and the history channel
i have nothing more to say but it was awful i cannot imagine why helen mirren and others were part of this degrading mess and if certain actors don't want people to question their sexuality then perhaps they should refrain from making more of these films there was at least one seen that left me curious just my opinion shudder to think what was going on that was cut from the film shudder to wonder what went through the minds of the actors who made this film shudder to think about the thought process and voyeurism that went on in the directors mind like i stated before its a degrading mess its not even funny as ebert said of the film caligula with malcolm mcdowell its not a good film not a good story and its not even good porn yeeshhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
sorry but every time i see a film wherein a woman sucker-punches a man and the man does nothing but cower the film looses all credibility so the new starbuck immediately tainted the plot before it even got off the ground pun intended dirk benedict was so much more plausible as the sensitive hero-type than the new-age kattee whose overacting will probably be henceforth lauded as a compelling exciting must-see ground-breaking performance by the politically correct new-speak of review copy editors but in essence it is just a tired old image of a woman with a chip on her shoulder as big as a townhouse the biggest clich√© on screens today i may give this series one more shot but human caricatures alone will not keep me tuned in as james hilton once bemoaned a story please just give me a story
whether you want to spend nearly hours of your life watching this depends how you like your horror movies if you like them so god damn awful they're hysterical watch away jigsaw is without a doubt the worst movie i've seen in my life i've seen long time dead and i say this as a fan of the low-budget genre and having seen a good few to compare it to i'm not even going to go into the specifics of what makes this movie was bad as it is the only good thing about it is so so terrible one of the funniest things i've seen in years if you can find this to rent cheap definitely worth watching if you were involved in making it shame on you o imdb need to introduce a ranking especially for this movie it thoroughly deserves it
this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen robin williams fit into the part like a rhino would fit into a tutu even so his performance was still pitiful kurt russell was more believable but still was awful the plot left much to be desired and the rest of the acting was also terrible the only thing this movie had going for it was the trailer which suckered me in to wasting minutes of my life which could have been better spent trying to lick the back of my yourself a favor and burn this movie if you have it if not just be happy you don't
everything about this film was terrible to start with this film had a pretty good cast and i find it impossible to make such a great cast into the biggest disaster to the gangster film genre ever the sound track was like one of a very bad slap stick comedy it had this music through the whole film and it started to get quite please please please please do not inflict yourself with this disaster you will only be hurt
i went to see this film yesterday and although i didn't have high hopes for this film i was still bitterly disappointed i actually cant believe i spent minutes of my life watching this was that bad the storyline was disgraceful and the acting was terrible though it had big names such as uma thurman in it this film heavily relied on its special they personally had no effect on me i honestly wished id never watched it and i strongly warn everyone against seeing this film it is a total waste of money and you'll only end up being disappointed afterwards my advice is to save your money go shopping treat yourself just don't go and see this film you'll live to regret it lol
this is a really stupid movie in that typical genre action comedy conceptwise it resembles rush hour but completely lacks the action the laughs and the chemistry between the main characters of that movie let it be known that i enjoy jay leno as a stand-up and as a talk show host but he just cannot act he is awful when he tries to act tough he barely manages to keep that trademark smirk off his face while saying his one-liners which by the way aren't very funny and seeing him run back then is not a pleasant sight in addition i have a feeling that pat morita at least by standards doesn't give a very politically correct impression of the japanese don't even get me started about the story i give it a out of
when i rented this i was hoping for what reign of fire did not deliver a clash between modern technology and mythic i got a standard monster hunts stupid people in remote building flick with bad script bad music bad effects bad plot bad acting bad bad reason why i did give it a was that in theory there could exist worse movies in theory
i should have known i was in trouble with casper van diem as the lead character words cannot describe nor do they do justice to just how terrible this movie was but please allow me to try to describe it horrible acting terrible dialog corny situations and through it all you get the feeling that you are being force-fed the beliefs and propeganda from the trinity broadcasting network its a weak attempt at trying to show hollywood that a movie can be entertaining and have a deep religious message attached to it they failed miserably it was clearly the worst movie i have seen in a long time
trite clich√©d dialog and plotting same kind of stuff we saw all through the fantasy movies hokey music and a paint-by-numbers characters knocks this out of the running for all but the most hardcore saves this film from the junk heap is the beautiful crutch of work the rotoscoping and the fact that frank frazetta taught the animators how to draw like him this is motion the violence is spectacular and the art direction and animation are unlike any other sword sorcery movie of the like to watch this with the sound off playing the soundtrack to the first conan movie instead
i didn't think it was possible for a horror comedy film to fail so abysmally on both awful the fact that it doesn't take itself seriously a good thing works against it primarily because the actors are so wooden you really would swear they are reading cue cards on the upshot version as always has a few laughs
bad acting bad southern accents inconsistent cinematography horrible was looking forward to this film at a recent film festival and was so discouraged after seeing it it contains name talent but they do not deliver of course the basis for this is the uneven and uninteresting story that is bother
i didn't know if i would laugh or cry seeing this only addicted fans of danni filth could have a taste for this this is supposed to be a horror movie but only filth in this the most cool scene is the car accident with real special effects from the best of hollywood avoid this movie at all costs see this only for studies of how bad can be a movie
this could be one of the worse movies i've ever seen i don't see how could this ever be described as a horror movie or even a thriller its more like a lumbering drama the scary music is excellent but since there weren't any scary situations the director thought it would be a good idea to use it for everyday activities like taking a dump or walking down stairs the movie had so much potential they had beautiful cinematography and interesting characters but it seemed as if the writers assumed you already knew them they would undergo peculiar activities without explanation or even a clue at what they meant this is simply one of those movies that says its about one thing and it something totally different
this version of moby dick insults the audience by claiming it is based on novel-even going so far as to show a phony first chapter sentence rather than the famous call me ishmael in addition to having atrocious acting even from john is perhaps the greatest example of how far hollywood early hollywood would go to revise and change a famous novel just to beef up its chances at the box of the language has been absolutely eradicated and ahab has been changed from a madman to a hero who only wants to kill moby dick after his turns away from him after seeing his wooden leg to this is added the standard evil brother who wants the fiance for himself and a different ending
this movie is just so awful so bad that i can't bear to expend anything other than just a few words avoid this movie at all costs it is of the details of the crimes are re-enacted correctly lots of slaughterhouse footage weird cuts and edits no continuity to the plot the acting is absolutely the most amateur i have ever bomb of a movie was obviously made to make some money without any regard to the accuracy of content the camera work is out of focus at times and always shaky it looks as if it was shot on fact now that they've got dennis rader with life in prison i wish they would put the guys that made this horrible movie into prison as don't even think about watching this one i'd give it a negative star if i could
i argued with myself whether to rent this or not i'm always afraid of renting something i've never heard of remember this being in theaters great what tipped the scales minutes in i almost stopped watching it the first few minutes are fun to watch but unbelievable it only gets worse after that the writers of this movie could do a little research on future projects if they want to make their movies even a little better or they could just try writing something just a little bit believable i give it a for the writing because there are a for being able to get so many good actors to agree to do this movie despite having to read the script oh my god this movie sucks
put the blame on executive producer wes craven and financiers the weinsteins for this big-budget debacle a thrash-metal updating of dracula with a condescending verbal jab at bram stoker probably wouldn't want his name on this thing anyway and nothing much for the rest of us except slasher-styled jolts and gore christopher plummer looks winded as van helsing in the just a descendant of van helsing but the real thing he keeps himself going with leeches obtained from count corpse which is exhumed from its coffin after being stolen from van vault and flown to new orleans this is just what new orleans needs in the century the film well-produced but without a single original idea for multi-racial victims is both repulsive and lazy and after about an hour starts repeating itself from
don't even ask me why i watched this the only excuse i can come up with that i was sick with bronchitis and too weak to change the channel too terrible for words the movie that is not the bronchitis the acting is deplorable richard grieco hams it up as a trigger-happy gun-slinging serial killer with a penchant for knocking off cops nick mancuso phones in a performance as the cop on his trail and nancy allen manages to put in the only sympathetic role in the entire film the script is dismal peppered with clich√©d lines are you ready pardner purrs richard grieco to every single one of his victims dire avoid
this movie is a farce names are grossly mispronounced and the plot is twisted and gnarled into something unrecognizable by any literature enthusiast and they have the gall to give beowulf a ridiculous weapon beowulf doesn't need a weapon like that in the poem he rips off arm with his bare hands and i can't believe that the scriptwriters did such a thing the way grendel is portrayed is impressive however that and the cast are the only positive points of the feature my english teacher would go insane if she saw this abomination unless you are a die-hard fan of the epic poem beowulf avoid this film at all costs and even then i wouldn't recommend it
so after reading the little feud on here i decided i had to see this movie for myself this movie is horrible i stopped watching it i strongly recommend cleaning a closet instead of watching this movie you'll be more low budget with bad is giving this movie is completely incorrect and should be am in no way connected to any of the other put this movie is not worth very bad movie
wow what a snoozer definately one of worst films the bad acting coupled with a formulatic if not incredulous script make me yearn for time i wasted on viewing this on cable television back not really much i can say about it a basketball scout gets too attached to the person recruiting who happens to belong to a tribe that happens to be on the verge of war which happens to be decided by a basketball game grade
i'll admit i think uma thurman is the most beautiful woman on the planet and have made it a mission to see every movie she has been in that includes the horrible films batman and robin the avengers and this has to rank as the worst movie i've ever seen it ranks even lower than the avengers everyone looks lost in it and it is incoherent beyond belief if you think uma is a goddess like i do please please don't subject yourself to this movie you'll hate yourself the following morning for it
the director outfitted in chains and leather warned the audience at the sf frameline film festival friday night that we were about to see an experiental film experimental leave the video camera on the back seat of the car let the tape roll and edit in all the pointless dreck within eyesight a meandering pastiche road show manqu√© that starts nowhere and takes the audience no place the gratuitous violence that opens the movie drove more than one patron from the castro theater i would have left too but my cine-buddy needed a ride home and has this thing about seeing even the worse merde through to the end by the time the lights came up the audience had thinned considerably tepid applause pro forma questions of the director who seemed pleased with the product avoid this film
ok so a low-budget film used the quotes because it was shot in video the acting is universally horrid the makeup is laughable blood looks like it came from sherwin-williams and i've seen more convincing bruises made from halloween ghoul kits and the lighting generally looks like they used borrowed toyota pickup to shine headlights on the might be able to forgive these low-budget traits if there were some actual content if a movie made an attempt to tell a story but this collection of video footage can boast of no plot no real characters and no momentum a self-indulgent don't worry no spoilers here cause absolutely nothing to spoil
i have been an environmentalist for years and was really looking forward to this show i had it set to record all episodes because i thought i could really learn some great new things i probably could if i could get past sure a lot of this is staged to seem like a reality show and appeal to that class of viewer it doesn't work for someone really interested in improving the show should be called nagging with ed is such a great font of information maybe a second show really serious about the environment would be a good idea dumbing things down is not necessary for some of us no longer record episodes or watch the show but do let me know if a real green show may be in the works
truly terrible pretentious endless film director bellocchio seems to be infatuated with the pretty face and figure of his actress detmers and who can blame him but maybe just maybe he should have focused his attention a little more on making a good engaging film i hate it when a sex film poses as an art film just to become more respectable the frequent occasionally hot sex scenes are the only reason for this existence whether or not they are worth sitting through the rest of the picture is strictly a matter of taste
this is one really bad movie i've racked my brain and i cannot come up with one positive comment to make the acting is atrocious i've seen more believable performances on cable access the plot is ridiculous stolen diamonds secret recordings of the president and a shark that attacks anything that gets near it should have made for cheesy fun at the worst night of the sharks isn't even so bad good the dialogue sounds and is delivered as if it were written seconds before filmed and to top it off night of the sharks has the worst soundtrack i've ever heard i'm surprised my ears didn't start bleeding from the techno synthesized sounds that someone actually bothered to everything i've read the italian film industry was dead by night of the sharks is like a final nail in the coffin
i got this movie because i worked at a movie store so i got free rentals it came in and the cover made it look alright hot chick carrying a weapon alright i'll check it man bad move this was so horrible i spent half the movie watching in fast-forward to get to the nudity which was minimal i think maybe three scenes of partial dialogue crappy violence poor excuses of characters i feel bad putting this movie down because i know it was made on a cheap budget but so was clerks and it became a cult classic and a
this was so far the worst movie i have seen in my entire life and i have seen some really bad movies i saw this movie at my local video store and the cover looked like it could be a decent horror movie little did i know that the cover would be the best part of the movie where to start the filming of the movie was scattered and boring at one point there is a one-minute scene of no one talking just a car driving to a ranch on a normal sunny day nothing happened they just drove in silence the whole movie is boring with annoying unbelievable dialogue and basically no plot to speak of if you rent this movie watch it with some friends and it might make a good comedy otherwise when you see this movie run
i just watched this horrid thing on tv needless to say it is one of those movies that you watch just to see how much worse it can get frankly i don't know how much lower the bar can go characters are composed of one lame stereo-type after another and the obvious attempt at creating another bad news bears is embarrassing to say the very have seen some prized turkeys in my time but there is no reason to list any of them since this is numero me put it to you this way i watched the vanilla ice movie because it was so bad it was funny not even that good
this is the worst brain damaged ultra cheap super stupid silly pointless piece of trash i've ever seen an unbelievable garbage of instant cult status among fans of the bizarre if you think that ed plan is bad well let me tell you looks like citizen kane compared to that one plan is star wars johnson is al pacino so beyond bad really but if you are looking for that kind of incredible movies for you i'm a fan of american international for so many glorious horror movies the price-corman-poe saga and some great blaxploitation stuff but with star creatures they descend right down to the z level of course my out of works in reverse if you like to watch bad movies for fun guy playing an indian chief is great so have fun and enjoy if you can
when i first saw the cover of this movie giant bug chasing a few nurses and the name blue monkey i knew i wasn't in for any big hollywood movie i was pleasantly surprised to see steve railsback in this cheese-ball flick who always does a good job in whatever role he tackles the fx are pretty corny there isn't too much of a plot and i'm still not sure why this movie is called blue monkey because there is nothing in this movie to do with monkey but come on people what did you expect not really as bad as it seems if you enjoy the old style black and white bug attack movies this one is basically an updated version without the updates special fx
my friend bought the movie for is not even cent worth because they wrote it was like american pie but we would soon find out that there is a long way from american pie to that piece of crap it is not even a comedy its more like a really really really bad documentary not only the story is bad the picture and sound also sucks to they put in some alcohol chicks dwarfs and drunken teens and the result is a disaster if you see this movie don't buy it rather spend your money on something else and better if you are gonna torture yourself then don't invite your unless you hate really much and you want to get rid of them
lifetime did it again can we say stupid i couldn't wait for it to end the plot was senseless the acting was terrible especially by the teenagers the story has been played a thousand times are we just desperate to give actors a job the previews were attractive and i was really looking for a good in awhile lifetime comes up with a good movie this isn't one of them unless one has nothing else to do i would avoid this one at all cost this was a waste of two hours of my life can i get them back i would have rather scraped my face against a brick wall for two hours then soaked it in peroxide that would have been more entertaining
just plain good old stupid mean really stupid not the good stupid like killer tomatoes or ed wood movies this is probably the most stupid movie i ever have seen to give this movie an golden turkey is an insult to turkeys to call this movie dumb is offensive even to dumb this is the future of american cinema and art we are better off to really start world war and at the same time and let the cockroaches run the show after i have to get drunk to wash this insult to my single braincell is a really good movie if you are suicidal
words can't simply describe how awful this film is i watched it on video last night and i simply could not believe what i was seeing basically snakeeater is about an ex-military man lamas and his search for his kidnapped sister who has been held captive by deliverance-style rednecks the acting writing direction photography and editing are deplorable along with a song called soldier that has to be one of the worst theme songs of all there is one treat horshack pallio from welcome back carter is in the film playing a laughable bad guy otherwise please avoid this mess at all costs
have i ever seen a film more shockingly inept i can think of plenty that equal this one but none which manage to outdo it the cast are all horrible stereotypes lumbered with flat dialogue i am ashamed for all of the people involved in making this each one wears an expression of fear not generated by the plot but by the realisation that this project could easily nix their career even the many charms of ms diaz don't provide an adequate reason to subject yourself to this avoid obviously a style of film that americans haven't really got a grasp of watch the final result if you must and you'll see what i'm talking about but don't say i didn't warn you
flight of fury takes the mantle of being the very worst steven seagal flick i've ever to a dreadful bore with no action scenes of any interest seagal isn't really trying in this fat and his voice is dubbed once co-stars fare no better being a rather sorry load of direction by keusch is very poor and it comes as no surprise that also responsible for another couple of seagal stinkers man attack force the screenplay co-written by seagal himself is laughably to imdb was spent on this boring load of old tosh if these figures are correct i sense a big tax fiddle as nowhere near that amount was of fury is actually a shot for shot remake of the michael dudikoff flick black thunder which has to be better than this has no redeeming qualities it a miss out of
this snarky homophobic thing was dated in it seems particularly mean-spirited now filled with gay stereotypes and characters that are meant to be laughed at rather than with redd foxx does his standard schtick michael warren at least tries to bring humanity to a one dimensional character and what were you pearl bailey deserves far better
when i saw this movie circa it became the first movie that i ever walked out of in the middle there is nothing worse than comedy that just misses being funny and this misses every time i can't speak for the last minutes of the movie there was nothing original about any of the skits while i enjoy racy humor where appropriate these skits were needlessly vulgar what was even more irritating was that this movie was advertised as robin first movie capitalizing on his new found fame in the mork and mindy television series yet his role turned out to be so minor that you cannot even notice him on-screen
i enjoy watching western films but this movie takes the biscuit the script and dialogue is laughable the acting was awful where did they get them from music was ok i have to say luckily i didn't buy or rent the movie but its now disposed was geared up at the beginning when the stranger sheen started to tell his story i have to admit i did enjoy the confrontation between hopalong and tex where hopalong shot finger off and told him to practise for years to reach his league but thats where it all went pear shaped thereafter i had to watch the whole film in the hope that it would get better never did
i am probably one of the few who actually read stephen book the one this movie was based on after reading this excellent work i could not wait to see the movie version of it after viewing the movie i was totally disappointed the only thing that this movie has in common with the book is the title and the names of the characters in the book character is put on a game show the main object is to survive but not in an arena set loose in the city and has to escape the game guess you'd call them villians who bear absolutely no resemblence to the movie characters this premise built much tension and suspension and ended greatly with the climax the movie was absolute garbage there was no cinematic quality to it i totally respect arnold schwarzenegger as an actor but he messed up with this one
how sad there is no option to post a mark lower than i watched this piece of nonsense and could barely believe what i was watching every single part of the film was awful music acting direction story everything simply everything i actually found myself laughing out loud at various points in the film i particularly loved the bit where our hero is dashing through the hospital in soft focus slow motion and knocks the clipboard out of the nurses hand because well just because product placement everywhere if you are of a christian persuasion and very easily satisfied you may like this movie if you do like this movie you really need to get out more
this movie is not only a very bad movie with awful actors presumed a bored direction and a story unattractive it also copies exactly an scene from the excellent giallio torso directed by sergio martino in years before one of the most celebrated psycho-thrillers of italian cinema and a cult-movie around the world in la sanguinusa conduce la danza the director replays the bed scene between the black girl and the white girl with an peeping-tom watching from a window of the bedroom naturally the scene in movie is ridiculous and inferior to the softness and charming in film to put another black girl another white girl and another peeping-tom replaying the scene is simply the most appropriate way of prove that movie has no ideas no originality no taste and nothing at all i think that such things are an offense to spectator
it is incredible in that it succeeds in being terrible on so many levels the script the acting the directing and the choice of cast are all appalling the costumes sets and pseudo-medieval language are also utterly awful in an odd way i actually enjoyed this film once i had accepted that it wasn't going to be any good it seems a shame that people would spend so much time and effort producing something so poor when really they could have made something pretty decent out of the premise not very believable but instead we are treated to a rather nauseating and cheesy tale of dragons and knights that lacks any of the charm to be found in other such fantasy films just hope that the lord of the rings is a bit better oh and david thewlis haircut makes him look like he-man it does
this full title is waqt race against time a race no one can ever win but you can certainly cut your losing margin by not wasting any of your precious waqt on this bakvaas this movie was clumsy and manipulative in a way that made look honest it strained my credulity too far it was ridiculously stupid in its storyline and deserves to be mocked for not quite as awful as baghban or black but this movie has nothing to recommend it stupid pointless with a ridiculously ott performance by amitji the central plot is another nasty example of the crudely manipulative propaganda that infests so many family bw films if my father who raised me and who i love dearly treated me like big b did akshay i'd shoot him myself to say nothing of the trivialising of terminal illness
i can't believe i wasted my time with this movie i couldn't even call it a movie it was so bad with nothing to recommend it like low budget movies and weird flicks but this one had me bored to death badly made and bad acting ruined it from being curious you have to wonder what these people were thinking when they spent money to produce this movie i wonder what i was thinking watching it to the end i recommend this movie to no one how did they release this was there an audience who likes this kind of movie there must be because you can find this at almost any video store but to be you like bad movies then this is for you
along with days in the valley i think this is one of worst movies i've ever seen just another of the long line of tarantino rip-offs that have emerged since pulp fiction the atmosphere the movie creates is amusing for the first five minutes but then the film makers make the unforgivable mistake of allowing unnecessary and grotesque violence to up the hip quotient you're better off skipping this one
this movie is so awful it is hard to find the right words to describe first the story is so narrow-minded human can write a better plot the actors are boring and untalented perhaps they were compelled to play in this cheesy camera receptions of the national forest are the only good in this whole movie i should feel ashame because i paid for this lousy nobody makes a sequel or make a similar film with such a worse storyline
my wife and i really had high hopes for this film but it was a major disappointment it was a native american version of mr magoo a pathetic father who fails at everything he tries fishing hunting in an obvious way he subjects his family to his wild fantasies his visions are not only ridiculous but in the process he lies to his son numerous times about various obvious things words cannot express how bad this film is the children and wife are very real which makes the film even sadder i don't get the humor unless you like laughing at other people making a fool of themselves i don't get how this could have come up for awards save your bucks not worth the rental
this movie is unworthy of the omen title it is so bad that it has actually damaged the classic nature of the first three it never should have been made they ought to change the don't even spell damien name correctly and there are no daggers the most important element of all the omen films pull it from the shelves and burn it
i will say that at least the movie makes sense but bad the acting for the most part is not good think only sky showed any promise and you feel awkward watching it all of the scenes that should be meaningful are really shallow like when ng comes out to her parents there are a lot of corny details like the kanji tattoo on the shoulder the magnets on the girls refrigerator and the god awful decor at the the everything real life has never been like this movie the boy says at one point i'm gay not corny and not aware even the commentary is awful i turned it off after ng talks about how she was weirded out playing a lesbian
annie potts is the only highlight in this truly dull film mark hamill plays a teenager who is really really really upset that someone stole the corvette he and his classmates turned into a hotrod possibly the ugliest looking car to be featured in a movie and heads off to las vegas with annie to track down the evil genius who has stolen his pride and would have plucked out my eyes after watching this if it wasn't for the fun of watching annie potts in a very early role and too bad for hamill that he didn't take a few acting lessons from her danny bonaduce also makes a goofy cameo
first off i had my doubts just looking at the dvd box and reading it saying that it was about of bunch of teens gathering at a lake where they will find do or something any movie that has a premise like this has failed miserably even as a slasher movie except for the first friday the wanted to get up and stop watching the movie at least times but i just kept thinking that it had to get a little better it didn't usually i think every movie has something that you can take from it this has yourself a favor and find something constructive to do for minutes like give yourself papercuts or eat dirt
awful just awful my old room mate used to watch this junk and it drove me crazy the book is one of my favorites and its a shame that some people will never know what it is really like because their first impressions are from dribble like this they changed so much it is hardly recognisable which baffles me since the book reads like a soap opera anyway providing enough fodder for modern day entertainment like one of those lifetime movies that say based on a true story but are completely fictional there is none of the emotion or depth of the book just mindless melodrama if you are a high school student looking for a way to get out of reading i suggest you try another version
what is the point of creating sequels that have absolutely no relevance to the original film no point this is why the prom night sequels are so embarrassingly original film entailed a group of children hiding a dark secret that eventually get them all killed bar one in a brutal act of revenge can someone please explain to me what a dead prom queen-to-be rising from the grave to steel the crown has to do with the first movie then prom night had continuous plot holes that left the audience constantly wondering how did that happen and why should that happen but in the end i guess you could call it one of those movies that is so bad you end up laughing yourself through it
although there were some amusing moments i thought the movie was pretty lame the longer it ran the worse it got once the action entered monument valley i found myself watching the magnificent outcroppings more than the increasingly silly and unconvincing interaction of the character of the daughter was particularly incoherent first in on the deal then discovers the truth and she bails then back again then deserts them again then back again no apparent motivation for any of her decisions there were interesting characters some interesting scenes and many missed possibilities i would have to say the pictures was much less than the sum of its parts apparently the people who liked repo man were inclined to like this one searchers is no match for the searchers
ok i caught this film halfway through that guy who is now in teachers and the book group although at least he has proved that he can act if he wants to part where someone has a heart attack stands out as a bastion of bad film making both in terms of acting scripting and general plausibility it quite clearly appears to be a cash-in on human traffic but whilst that is not the best film ever it is at least original and had actors whose delivery did not resemble that of earnest-yet-hopeless gcse students trying to get a pass grade not so much as human traffic as a bit of a car crash
if you go see this movie you'll be holding a grudge against the movie theatre the director the producer the actors and the person that told you to go see it shame on you sarah michelle geller for putting your name and face to this poor excuse of a movie it may have been more scary if the japanese actors would have just spoken in japanese instead of attempting to act in english i wanted to boo when the movie true disappointment after all of the hype on tv and movie trailers promoting this lame money maker sarah michelle really didn't have to act at all to make this just practiced her frowning skills don't waste your time or money on this film
isabelle huppert is a wonderful actor the director of la pianiste understands this providing the viewer with long takes of face and these are a pleasure to see huppert is not an animated registers emotion with the smallest lift of an eyebrow or flicker of a than the enjoyment of watching an experienced actor excel in her profession there is nothing in this movie that makes me want to recommend it if you enjoy self-mutilation sado-masochism and bizarre behavior la pianiste might work for you other than these attributes i could not find any redeeming value in in all this strange material there is a kernel of truth people who compete at the very highest athletically as strange people and are shaped into stranger people by the competitive worth a trip to a movie theater to relearn this life lesson
renown writer mark redfield edgar allen poe tries to conquer old addictions and start a new life for himself as a baltimore maryland magazine publisher however blackouts delirium and rejection threaten to thwart his efforts he would also like to rekindle romance with an old sweetheart a significantly flawed prospect as things turns out mr redfield also directed this dramatization of the mysterious last days of edgar allen poe redfield employs a lot of black and white color and trick photography to create mood kevin g shinnick dr john moran performs well relatively speaking not enough
i saw this film by accident and this movie was an it must of been blonde women being villain appearing then disappearing getting from one place to another in then disappearing and was'nt even a super hero so i don't know how he did could'nt frighten a cat and not hard to old mirror in the just not scary anymore in fact it stopped being scary years ago you had the cop on the trail of the by idris elba with a very convincing american from london the director did'nt have a clue and has made a film full of and scary was a comedy look scary pathetic
this movie is not for the faint or weak of heart it couldn't decide if it was going to be porn or legit it was neither one it was just bad there was nothing in this movie to make me want to see anything else made by these people again
if you merely look at the cover of this movie cool don't the movie itself put me to sleep it was slow paced had minimal violence and a poor use of suspense the acting was bottom feeder material and the plot while it would've been cool for a different movie was poorly shown here they even kill the only likeable character in the whole film i give it a out of because the only thing that was good was the plot twist at the end other than that you might want to save yourself from this movie trash
this film can not even be said to be bad for it is sadly just painfully mediocre lacking any real wit or imagination a thin plot is stretched to the absolute limit and the are predictable and threadbare are spun out to such inordinate length that boredom and yawns quickly overtake the viewer another notch to mark the sad decline of john waters and a reminder that what or amused us years ago doesn't work quite the same way now we've seen it all before and it no longer breaks any taboos because they have long since evaporated a major miss
algie the miner is one bad and unfunny silent comedy the timing of the slapstick is completely off this is the kind of humor with certain sequences that make you wonder if they're supposed to be funny or not however the actual quality of the film is irrelevant this is mandatory viewing for film buffs mainly because its one of the earliest examples of gay cinema the main character of algie is an effeminate guy acting much like the stereotypical pansy common in many early films the film has the homophobic attitude common of the time algie the miner is pretty awful but fascinating from a historical viewpoint
jean-claude van damme plays twin brothers alex and chad both whom are martial arts expert who team up to take down the mobsters responsible for the murder of the parents in this empty headed martial arts actioner which doesn't have a plot that would make better use of the gimmick of having two jean-claude van dammes some okay actionscenes but this is not one of van best
remember the name kevin lime and please please never direct again timing pacing editing all hopelessly or four decent professionals time guys walk off can do nothing to save this film from amateurs like and the kind of production standards you'd expect shows on british mystery the music a score so inept inappropriate to the tone of the film that one seriously wonders if it case of sabotage add an acoustic that booms from a single mike and a director who remembers to add auditory action offscreen and what must be on of the greatest ratio of money to result years
boy oh boy oh golly most interesting thing in the movie was the hilarity of the bluescreen effects used to create invisibility they looked like they were shot on cheap video and it looks totally unreal and not even in a good way where its so funny that you end up loving the did not end up loving this movie the attempted steadicam shots were really pathetic as well i mean hey if they had a low budget flick fine you can still make a great movie with a low budget but a bad movie and a low budget and effects that makes for a bad combination in this case such a doomed combo created the craptastic film invisible mom if you have kids and your kids have no taste perhaps they will stay awake through all of this one
story the time i sort of figured out where it was going i no longer cared bad on william macy as a hit man bad you ever seen tracey ullman perform so i supposed to care what happened to the unethical incompetent uncaring john ritter character bad really i'm not looking for a formula script but this was really awful the only really good thing in it was the kid ten lines not ok if your comment is less than ten lines come whose rules are those why can't i say what i have to say in less than lines isn't that kind of arbitrary why isn't it ok to have less than lines of comment
ok i am blessed i have seen two very strong stage productions the one in new york with the original cast and another at the san diego rep reynolds and monique gaffney you rock compared to either of these the movie is almost unwatchable i've been plodding through the dvd for the past two evenings and am still not finished way too much extraneous dialog and waaay too many added scenes and people yes the four major performances are quite good esp ms but comparing stage to film is definitely an example of less is more the thickening of the play to satisfy film-goers need for scenic variety and specificity was a poor choice please please please go find a stage production somewhere near you
ariauna albright is a really good actress but why she participated in this lame written travesty is a mystery what could have been entertaining winds up as classic boredom the unique thing about ariauna is that she can act as well as look real sexy as opposed to her partner lilith stabs who looks fine but it is obvious she spent the money for acting school at the spa or beautician this was a production that cried out for some t a with a imaginative script writer could have achieved it in the flow of things however ariauna does what she can under the circumstances to a extent salvages her reputation the tempe company should be aware that when you dress two attractive women in skimpy fetish cop uniforms the viewers will expect some fetish play t a nough said
at a panel discussion that i attended after viewing this film the filmmakers stated that one should look at this not as a movie but a provoker of thought well the only thoughts that were provoked from me were of the time wasted watching the movie the gimmicks of the film style futuristic setting served as distractions of what was supposed to be a thoughtful examination of the abortion debate this film illustrates the problem when people try to use film as a platform for their political views usually a very boring movie that preaches to the choir
this piece of filth is virtually impossible to follow the sound is crap the picture quality goes from bad to worse to good to bad again things happen for no apparent reason characters appear and disappear was the director suffering from a massive brain injury during its film making aside the story is vile just sick evil if you like rape murder and self harm this is right up your alley and if simulated scenes of murder are not enough you can enjoy clips of actual people being executed i watched almost all of it but had to turn off after i seen someones brains blown out never before have i seen a film that left me feeling so ashamed and dirty
you've heard it said to live every moment as if your last whether your last day or not i beg you not to waste any part of it watching this nichole hiltz provides some nice moments of eye candy alas stays wrapped and david deluise shows why he should stick to the small screen or dog food commercials a shallow unrealistic plot with dreadful dialogue means there is no art in the art of
this is one very dire production the general consensus has always been that while princess margaret may have been spoilt and pampered and may have revelled in the excess of luxury at her disposal she was a very beautiful young woman here was the weakest point the actress failed to get that across it also appeared that the production budget couldn't stretch to a hairdresser from the outset the hair on the princess margaret character had a permanent birds nest in disarray look and looked as if she had been dragged through a bush the actor playing the duke of edinburgh appeared to have prepared for his role by watching rory bremner imitate prince charles and was production was a flaw ridden clich√© ridden embarrassing load of rubbish i think all daily mail readers deserve a free dvd copy for christmas
after watching about half of this movie i noticed something peculiar i found myself constantly switching through tv-channels to see what else is on not exactly a good movie movie is listed as being in a number of genres and i must say it mostly failed misserably in every one of them through the movie i switched over to watch an old rerun instead bottom line the whole movie felt as if the ones making it didn't exactly know what to make and ended up in a concoction with no discernable taste
i wanted to see the movie because of an article in a film magazine it wasn't a highly recommended one by the critic the storyline is different and i am sure that it could have been a good movie if it was in right hands directing and acting were awful i had the feeling of watching a movie which was made a bunch of amateurs although the movie started promisingly it got worse and worse i think this is an unoriginal movie with awkward characters i still think that it is worth watching as i haven't seen films subjecting gay porn don't keep your expectations high you will be very disappointed out of
to make a film straddling the prequels and the real star wars trilogy would tax even a great lucas is not that portray the fall of a good man into darkness needs a good christensen is not that first minutes are overwhelmingly boring with only a few pockets of yet more light sabre fights but there is a lack of edge because you already know which main characters survive to the original star dooku lee has a very fleeting role here and about the best idea is to have jar jar binks silent the film only picks up with the chancellor turning on the jedi and has one great sequence at the lava falls
i really wanted to like this movie because the critics have been it say the least but it was terrible really terrible a witless script cack handed direction watching this film watching a car you want to look away but you keep you want to see how messy going to get well the car and there are no survivors on the plus side the nice made me want to go on holiday if only to cleanse myself unholy
i am definitely in the minority opinion on this one the hurt locker has won more best picture awards from the critic groups than any other film this year however not only did i not like it i found it hard to sit is minimal plot and little character development they disarm bombs fight and disarm more bombs that is the entire movie the worst part was that the camera never stops moving and is constantly shaking this has been a recent fad in film making and it is supposed to make it seem more real because it has a cheap documentary look to it the camera was shaking so much it was making me nauseous to look at the normally don't care for war movies and the hurt locker was no exception but you don't need to take my word for it because the critics love it
i should have never watched this movie the style of filming may be considered artsy to some but it is considered migraine-inducing to me i think it may have had an interesting plot but since i couldn't watch it for long stretches at a time i missed a lot the flickering pictures and stop motion filming branded my brain i stopped watching mid way through and won't be back for a second try i suppose if i were home alone in my own lighthouse some dark and stormy evening this might be just the ticket ps not sure if the film style thing can be considered a spoiler but i don't want to be blacklisted on my first review
this is one of the worst movies i've seen in a long time the story was boring the dialogue was atrocious and the acting hammy i'm not sure if this movie was the result of a film school homework project but it certainly played like one it is not even particularly successful in its central conceit of trying to appear as a single continuous take the whooshing horizontal camera pans are a cheap and unoriginal way of hiding cuts
i got all excited when i saw the ads for this movie because i recently read the book and really enjoyed it the movie however did not meet my expectations having read the book recently prepared me for big let down as often happens when stories are translated into movies the characters didn't seem to fit very well with the book the direction was weak i had a hard time getting into the characters there wasn't a real connection with the viewer about what was going on the dialog didn't explain adequately what was happening it just seemed slapped together and rushed through all in all i was very disappointed with the movie i suppose if you haven't read the book it might be ok by itself at the very least it might entice you to read the book which you'll probably enjoy
i simply could not finish this movie i tuned out after what i would say is my nomination for the most wretched attempt at sexual suggestion award a scene in which pia zadora at a picnic stands between two boys who want her one good boy pleads for her to see the error of her ways the other bad boy simply asks if she'd like a hot dog which he then holds out for her at crotch level i hope i'm not spoiling anything to say she turns and takes the hot dog with a smile just pathetic
i saw this movie when i was much younger and i thought it was funny i saw it again last week and you can guess the result some funny parts in it very few and too long the beginning is the only thing that is funny if you ask you want a total b-movie this is a good pick but don't expect too much from aliens dwarf size
this film was really bad whether you take it as a sci-fi movie as a horror one or even as a comedy the whole thing is film looks is definitely cheap the actors have no idea of what acting is and the script shows clearly that it was being made along with the shooting it is obvious that the monster in the closet was added because the living head was not scary at all was even and they thought they needed something more impressive they failed here too make up is awful even for the late rather film shows clearly why director joseph career as such and also as a writer never materialized he was really bad at both same goes to the actors leading and brain that wouldn't best achievement is its short running time
usually when a movie receives a vote of one it is because someone simply dislikes it and is annoyed it doesn't have a lower rating and so decides to drag it down as much as they can instead of just giving it a low rating this is not the case is a perfect example of a film it does nothing right and it doesn't have the chance to because it doesn't really attempt to do anything there are strands of a bad novel kind of plot which doesn't hold together and a complete lack of any kind of acting throughout it is clear that nobody involved in this project gave it any kind of serious effort because even a completely patently untalented persons hard work would amount to more a truly awful film
this show is one of the worst shows of all time absolutely no original jokes and they're always a year late like in they will finally say something about michael dogfights all of the cast members are people who wanted to be on but had to go to the lowest of the low mad an hour of mad magazine jokes witch aren't funny to begin with told by terrible john stewart wanna bees so if you have any problem tell me id love to hear the opinion of the people who watch this show family guy put it well osama bin ladin was hiding in the one place no one would look the cast of mad tv there is a reason why no one watches the show
you have to figure that when the name is listed wrong in the opening credits you are not in for a good time credit reads cuba gooding some nice car chase shoot em up blow em up action if all you want is action because the relationship to what plot exists is tenuous at best and completely unbelievable the motivations of the characters especially that of at the end are worse then unbelievable they are irrational when they are not hopelessly muddled all i can think is that andy cheng must be a really nice guy to get this many good actors into this foul a project can't have something on all of them can he
the first one was different and funny this attempt should have never left the studio this movie does not make you laugh it is a weak attempt at gross out humor the movie picks out current and old movies to rip-off this time the jokes seem used and overdone the audience that i saw it with only re-acted to hannibal dinner scene and was otherwise asleep
this is surely one of the worst films ever made each scene is painful you will groan at the flimsy attempts at humor the awkward camera work the sexism and racism the ridiculous story line the wooden acting poor joan bennett she is the only one in the movie who is not an embarrassment in all dreadful
beast wars is a show that is over-hyped overpraised and overrated meet the characters of this obnoxious show whose creators must have been on acid to try and make a show like seriously they need to have censor bars on this guy how come he dosen't creep out the viewers having the same voice as baby taz least razzoff from rayman hoodlum havoc is voiced by slip slide action if you want a line of show that suck get tranceformers a show that should go down in a toilet good job creators show it self-retarded boring least the super mario games are better this show had a lot of followers sayin bring it back but i believe that it was cancelled for its own good
now i have never ever seen a bad movie in all my years but what is with songs in the movie what physiological meaning does it have wow some demented pok√©mon shows up and they multiply i can get a seizure from this animie is pointless the makers of it are pointless its a big marketing scheme look just cut down on songs and they will get a good rating i reckon that this movie would have been fine if they put out a message you must see all the pok√©mon episodes to understand whats going on and it is not a film it is just an animation it should be on i'll give it a because i just got bucks i could not give it a half because no halves
watched this on dvd in original language with english subs either the subtitling was very poor or the actual dialog doesn't make much of story and give any character development there are quite a few hk stars in this but the movie doesn't need their presence to make it better or worse just bad the bright and colorful scenes done in cg are attractive for the sheer colors and brilliance but it can get overwhelming before long if anything this makes me think of a movie with its nonstop barrage of cg fight scenes and crap plot i'm certain i grasped what took place in the film but the whole delivery of the story was rather lousy
i have seen every episode of this spin off i thought the first season was a decent effort considering the expectations of following such a success that is anatomy thus i have continued to watch i'm afraid the second season lacks the charm the chemistry and more importantly the drama of predecessor anatomy the relationships seem contrived and the acting is so-so the writing lacks the intelligence and comedic hints seen in ga there are shows that a formulaic but do not feel formulaic and contrived unfortunately pp is not so i loved kate presence in ga i'm afraid kate life in la is simply not interesting
unless you understand wretched excess this movie won't really mean much to you an attempt was made to interject a bit of humanity into a cold and bleak period consumed by alcohol and drugs it doesn't salma hayak does her big disco number her voice is so obviously dubbed it is pathetic the producers could at least have gotten someone that sounded remotely like documentary that has been playing on television lately is far superior and gives a much truer view of that period of our one with the exception of mikey myers could be accused of acting however he does an incredible job
i am terribly sorry i know that fa√übinder still is called one of the greatest directors in post-war germany and that most of his films are considered master-pieces but when i see lili marleen today in i wonder what everyone is up and away about this movie the acting is simply terrible hanna schygulla is all the smiling like an idiot the changings between nazi-glamour and battlefields are ridiculous the whole film looks as if it was made within two days in an attic probably it was exactly that way and many people seem to take this for real art but for me this movie is simply bad cheap compare this to viscontis la caduta degli dei and tell me again that lili marleen is a good movie
big bad ralph is also on the not so squeazy truck commercials and can be found at numerous brothels around melbourne any given film by the way wasn't shocking just bad main guy was in charge of the metal section on countdown and was the lead bouncer at a gay night club in dunno who the women where probably that ralph story of interest its one of those fast forward look up big bad ralph at brothels around famous in wish i could give but ill give it only cos i cant give
time travel is a fun concept and this film gives it a different slant i got a kick out of captain billingham one of the more down-to-earth characters who was just not having a good day ordinarily i don't choose to watch horror films but this is an exception good story excellent acting
the movie opens upon julian sands lying on his back a black kitten drooling blood into his awaiting mouth from where he holds it about two feet above him that was so provocative and i thought here we go a good vampire movie then it died that was literally the only scene which captured any part of the imagination it was slow uneventful drivel thereafter i was vastly disappointed as my previous experience with sands acting was quite enjoyable however this attempt was obviously misdirected and the screenplay left a lot to be julian questionable performance could not begin to save this already sunken barge of a rates a fiend
performance almost made attack the screen it wasn't all bad i just think the reporters role was wrong for cool j played the typical rapper role guy around i don't think the cracked a smile in the whole movie not even when proposed to his freeman pretty much carried the whole movie he was has some funny scenes which are the high point of the spacey wasn't good or bad he was just a dull movie bad plot a lot of bad acting or wrong roles for actors
why did i waste hours of my life watching this why was this film even made why am i even commenting on this reviewer said this film took patience to watch and it was n't for everybody i cannot figure out who this movie is for maybe after dropping a hit of acid somebody somewhere could watch this and make some sense out of it it is incoherent it isn't experimental plain and simple garbage the film follows no plot line whatsoever just when you think you have something don't think the ending brought some finality to the film pun intended the viewer gets a glimpse of what might have been going on i don't think i put a spoiler in here not that it would matter this film is another must miss in the world of filmdom
there are bad movies terrible movies even boring can watch most and put up until the end not this time avoid this like the plague annoying music throughout terrible editing no comedy its tackier than a novelty missus wanted to watch this thinking it would be legally blonde material or something kind of watchable but never better than average chick flick its the first time she was begging me to push the stop girls well they were not great to start with done ok in starship troopers and wild things but you have sank to the gravel i feel like a mug having spent minutes on anderson is almost unrecognisable after much construction work to her take my advice if you want to avoid wasting valuable oxygen and brain cells ranting at the utter mince that is on your screen
this movie is not as good as all think the actors are lowlevel and the story is very comic-like i respect fantasy but lord of the rings is is just normal did they include this splatter-tongue it makes everything worse the only good thing is the cinematography and the job
to this up at big lots for only three bucks i'll never see for what i'll tell ya an hour and fifteen minutes of boring boring boring chat and college angst that seemed more suitable for a lifetime movie than the horror flick advertised on the box the marketing droids who designed it burn in hell for all eternity follow that up with a little bit of cheap gore even good gore mind you and a plot twist at the end that comes out of nowhere and makes no sense awful awful there any redeeming qualities well on the joe bob briggs scale there were six breasts involved but hardly worth my long lost three bucks without those this coulda been on sci-fi at say two or three in the
shortly after seeing this film i questioned the mental competence of every actor and actress that accepted a role elizabeth shue is a commendable actress why would she embrace such an overrated opportunity i must give credit where credit is due though some moments in the movie were unpredictable and rather transfixing but they hardly made up for the scathing perverse tendencies of kevin character sebastian caine i wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone man or woman that has any form of self-respect to account for
beating the bad guys again is the tag line for this movie it exposes so much truth about alone one and two film classics home alone three and four a good film if you're three like sharkboy and lavagirl as hard as it tries to be funny not culkin is replaced by alex d'linz or something else a very bland actor with bland performances but not entirely his fault the writing called for bland vocabulary and bland expressions the pranks are just copied from the first two with different crooks and you'd have to be blind to think those chicken pox are real a good choice if you are a preschool teacher in which is showing this film on a rainy day and to make things worst a totally different cast go see if you don't believe me but you'll regret it
i should preface this by stating that i am a dolph lundgren fan the man turns out some of the funniest action clich√©s imaginable and detention is probably my personal favorite even though there is no such thing as a dolph spoiler since the scripts are so absurd to begin with a chase scene with a handicapped kid carrying a pistol versus a guy on a harley with a sub-machine gun through a high school hallway and the kid wins good game the oscar goes to detention dolph if you're reading this thanks for the laughs old summary terrific movie that is a guaranteed laugh i recommend inviting some friends over for this and forcing them to sit through it hilarious
this movie was terrible to say the least i was hoping for a lot better after seeing high school musical the whole entire movie was a complete rip off of the simple life only it wasn't a reality acting was not good at all amanda michalka had her moments when she wasn't that terrible on the other hand alyson michalka was bad all the way through chris gallinger who played the love interest of amanda was playing a french guy but had an awful accent one good thing about this movie was the completely adorable michael trevino who played love interest just something to keep in mind if this movie had been aired before high school musical it probably would not have seemed as bad but it was no i give it a
disney what happened i really wish the movie had been set in the like the book was and i really could have dealt with cheap special effects in order to save the budget for a more accurate adaption i'm glad that maybe someone might be influenced to read the books but the man with red eyes interchangeable as it and up with the volcanic upheaval where was that in the book peter jackson save us a long time ago i heard that there was european version of this film i sure wish i could id it i can only imagine it might be closer to the real story than this poor adaption this movie needs to be x'd
this naschy outing is directed by leon klimovsky and a cursory glance at the publicity photos and packaging might lead you to believe that this medieval romp lies somewhere between inquisition and sadomania sadly is a strictly pg affair with tame torture sequences no nudity and little edge at all naschy whom i am a fan struts his stuff as gilles de lancre antiguo mariscal de la nacion sadly he is more pantomime villain than anything else one gets the feeling with this film that we have seen him it done all before strictly therefore for naschy completest only
this movie was boring there are a few funny moments and jokes but you cannot base a whole movie on that characters are too stereotyped there is no real story but short episodes with freaky side-characters who are not freaky enough to make the plot because most of the actors are acknowledged in hungary a mystery why they took the roles is a new hope for the hungarian film it was boring though it was meant to be genuine or unique they could have tried much more harder than this out of
did heidijean really see this movie a great christmas movie not even close dull bland and completely lacking in imagination and heart i kept watching this movie wondering who the hell thought that carly pope could play the lead in this movie the woman has no detectable personality and gives a completely lackluster performance baransky was great as usual and provided the only modicum of interesting the whole thing probably her involvement was the only reason this project was green lighted to begin with maybe i'm expecting too much for a lifetime movie played days from christmas but i sat through this thing thinking that with a different director and a recasting jj with an actress that at least could elicit sympathy this could have been quite a cute little movie
this movie must have been the absolute worst movie i have ever seen my sister and her boyfriend went to rent zodiac and got this one by accident thought it was a joke before the actual movie this was terrible i was waiting for it to get scary and it never did this movie had not actual facts about the real zodiac killer the filmmakers clearly didn't even bother to research anything on the killings they only liked the name so they decided to write a script about nothing true to its name i am upset i didn't realize it wasn't the movie sooner i try to like something out of every movie i don't hate movies ever except this one if you could have given it no stars i definitely would have out of
normally i'm quite disposed to like low budget gonzo films but darkman iii is so appallingly unengaging that i feel nothing but contempt for looks and feels like a tv show and a particularly shoddy one at that the sets are sparse the lighting flat the score and effects disjointed and the camerawork is film school no plot to speak of the characters are one dimensional and the actors are sleepwalking most of the cast look like they should be doing soft core porn in fact the only reward that i got from this mess was spotting the startling squint faced roxann biggs-dawson from star trek voyager without her klingon bumpy head makeup on her skin tone is about two shades lighter than it is in voyager either been bleached down for this role or blacked up for voyager very strange either way
this is so incredibly bad poor actors you can tell they're trying really hard to polish a turd but we all know you can't the writing is so obvious and facile sad watching them try to sell it the humor and pacing are so labored hard to believe any of these good actors signed on for said so awful that we're having a hard time looking away from the screen we just have to know where this trainwreck goes but only because we caught it on tv if we had actually paid for this we'd be disgusted it gets stars for being at least bad and the incidental music opposed to the trying-too-hard indie soundtrack is laughably reminiscent of an episode of scooby-doo but not as good
this film is about a life going wrong his business is failing and he cannot impregnate his wife despite multiple plot is complete chaos it simply does not make sense in fact nothing in the film makes sense the story is so poorly told that i simply could not understand it it is a shame because the sets and costumes are done well and are visually stimulating enough the shots are well composed throughout the film however these redeeming features still cannot make up for the bad plot and poor story telling i am amazed by the big names who agreed to star in this film it is such a waste of their talents this film is very bad avoid it
of all movies i'm a film graduate if worth anything to you this is the worst movie i have ever seen i know there are probably some worse ones out there that i just haven't seen yet but i have seen this and this is the worst a friend and i rented it one night because denise richards was on the cover talk about being young and retarded uncredited her role was unbelievably small how did she make it on the cover imdb doesn't even list it in her filmography this movie was so bad we wrote a little note to the video store when we returned it and slipped it inside the case it read something like please save your further customers from having to view this complete and totally bad movie
in order to hold the attention for three hours we were treated not so much to a romp through four generations and years of hungarian history as to sexual liaisons with a sister a sister-in-law and other adulteries oh yes there was also a totally gratuitous rape having said all this the first story of the relationship among the children of the patriarch was fresh and sensual thanks to jennifer ehle
the lady in cement is a veritable course on social anthropology of the late the writing not the acting is at center stage did i say pure camp prepare to be offended if you are female or gay broad and dame are standard terms and gay baiting and bashing are represented for what they were in the day wise most of the lines are tossed off although there are wonderful performances by a very few outstanding character actors the action scenes are mundane but it is fun to see dan blocker play a tough guy who likes bashing toughs and lanie kazan and racquel welsh are at the voluptuous peak of their careers amazing to note they were both years old and mr sinatra was the musical score wait was there a score well you get the point watch it with friends who want a good laugh full of them
i was utterly disappointed by this movie i had read some of the other reviews here and had much higher expectations i expected a drama with more intense character development but that never happens in the movie daniel-day lewis is a good actor but not as good as some reviewers here would have us believe i tought he repeated the same set of or movements in the movie i would rate his performance out of out of direction is out of script is the worst out of deleted the movie from my dvr at mins into the movie much better movies out there than this
this is not a good film the acting is remarkably stiff and film doesn't seem to know whether it is going for a real horror approach or to go down the camp and kitsch route i never saw the first film but this one doesn't stand up on its own merits there are several unconvincing plot twists and the viewer is never made aware of the importance of the lead female vampire not worth the effort of watching
hearing about how hilarious this movie is i finally rent it video store and for minutes maybe i laughed times a collection of skits that make fun of television is mess the jokes fall flat the humor deals from the that just aren't relevant anymore jokes go on way too long like the new snl skits few years yeah chevy chase is in this but maybe of or minutes i liked the fact that this was and had nudity galore but couldn't it be funny a favor and rent kentucky fried movie which is a film made in the
when i saw previews of this movie i thought that it may be dumb but it will at least be funny well i was wrong even though somewhere deep down the producers had an interesting message to convey about parents being left alone and re-evaluating their life the way they tried to deliver that message was horrible the first fifty times something silly happened to the couple was relatively funny but by the end i could almost predict what stupid mishap is going to happen the movie i like a total of maybe five lines of dialogue and everything else was at best mediocre which is still more than i can say for the movie itself
the wife and i saw a preview of this movie while watching another dvd and thought jon heder diane keaton jeff daniels and eli wallach gotta be better than summer reruns so i ordered it from local library well any episode of lawrence welk would bring more laughs than boy i actually felt sorry for the actors for having to read the script in the privacy of their own homes and i couldn't imagine what it must have been like for them to have to actually say their lines in front of a camera perhaps at least maybe next time they're offered a movie of this sort they'll just say no a one anna two
shaggy scooby-doo get a clue like watching a much-loved relative in the final throws of a degenerative illness clearly the work of people with no soul no love or respect for the original work what in the name of all holy were they thinking of it seems they were trying to go all post-modern and ironic instead just abysmal swill the point in taking up a successful franchise like scooby-doo if you just going to flush it down the toilet my son loves the original series and even some of the spin-off movies but he can't stand this drivel and face it you can't argue against the tastes of a seven year-old
the video quality is awful the sound quality is pathetic the acting is horrific the dialog is painful the lighting is dismal the editing is laughable i could go on but it would be pointless snitch'd is a third rate amateur video being passed off as a feature film this one is best left to collect dust in the video store bargain bin
pictures that usually glorify a hero have meaning as an example bonnie and clyde glorified the dynamic bank robbers and you actually felt sympathy for them despite their evil deeds why they were two people caught up in the depression when people were desperate to film has absolutely no substance the viggo mortensen character soon emerges as a folk hero why he speeds along an idaho highway on the way to the hospital where his stricken wife has been taking no one bothers to understand why he is trying to flee everyone even worse when the realization becomes apparent that he is not a red-neck terrorist no one in government wants to help him as they try to save their rear priestley co-stars as a radio emcee who builds upon the story in support of our ending is absolutely unbelievable
i saw this movie thinking that it would be one of those old b movies that are fun to watch i was so wrong this movie was boring and obviously aimed at males who like looking at corpulent women the story was so ridiculous and implausible that it lost my interest altogether it seemed to be in the same genre as the ed wood films bottom of the barrel
we should have been suspicious to discover that with only two minutes to lights out we were the only ones there only five others joined before the movie is nothing at all to redeem this movie the acting is awful ms hurley the script is banal the effects we've seen a million times the film direction the worst that we've seen meandering and disjointed no-one laughed including the left after minutes it would have been sooner if my wife hadn't gone for a not waste your money on this film if nothing else to watch at your cinema then buy some drinks popcorn and hot-dogs and do some people watching you'll have a much more enjoyable
this has got to be one of those films where the trailer is times better than the movie first saw the trailer in it looked then i have always wanted to see it but could never find today yes years just say i was so disappointed its unreal ok i knew it wouldn't be an oscar winner but still had hopes that it would be a fun no-brain film in the bloodsport mold unfortunately it was not with all the american rock and roll music and the acting was so bad it was quite fight scenes were rubbish and look dvd only cost me and i believe i was overcharged by i'm sad as i know that i will never get that hour and a half back
a cheesy compellingly awful not in a fun way c grade movie everything shouts amateur from the crumby script premises limited coherence and predictable endings the turgid lighting sound and hand-held wobbly camera angles the coy and passe sexual inneundo and references the patchy and unbelievable dialgoue to the z rate acting i saw it on dvd and kept hoping edward wood would pop out all is forgiven your worst films are works of art and more coherent than this still preferable to the warbling every night in my dreams i hear you are you sure the titanic crew weren't involved in this on the side
this movie is an abomination and its making should have been considered a capital of the great mysteries of film-making is why nobody ever has made a faithful movie adaptation of this wonderful mystery it is a tale of a really gripping mystery nice old-fashioned romance and dry english humor why did the makers have to change richard gordon from a scotland yard policeman to an amateur detective introduce the idiotic role and caricature of his english servant change the part of the main storyline about the murder charge and circumstances of struggle to save the accused etc etc these producers and directors who always think they can make a better story than the one in the book should write the original script themselves and not to rape another product
this film turned up on local tv here in south africa recently and i thought that i'd warn even those who enjoy watching b grade bad movies i this is not even amusing the plot concerns a couple visiting a house in the country some strangers appear and the problem is that most of the film obviously shot in the early seventies consists of extreme wide shots of people walking in real time and awfully slowly from a to b this makes the film tedious in the extreme and the expected blood and gore payoff just never happens i am really curious how many people have actually watched this from beginning to end
couldn't believe it clipped sentences good grief know what all true real people ever talk like this don't think so good girl stout fellow stiffen upper lip only reason given movie instead of gary cooper such a dish movie as a whole ridiculous unless you like watching endless biplane dogfights seemed endless anyway think all franchot dialogue dubbed when crawford and young make a special effort to sound british they come over as irish handy tip we brits clip words not sentences and somehow we manage to draaaaaaaawl at the same time but only if we've been to a really good public private to you school
i have walked out of very few movies before they end but i couldn't finish this piece of garbage this was the biggest load of racism trying to pass as legitimate film since birth of a nation the characters were little more than cardboard cutouts i don't see how any actor would want their name associated with this film lee must have better things to do that put out garbage like this i know that i and anyone with a brain have better things to do like watching paint dry i wish that someone would make a film about interracial relationships that dealt with the topic realistically there is a lot more depth to this subject the shallow ranting of a bitter director like lee
what a piece of stupid won't even waste time evaluating any of the points of this show not worth the time the one comment i will make is why get such a dumb inarticulate doofus to be the aren't many more dismal testimonials to the deteriorating mental condition of the networks than the fact that fox has stated it will not bring back john doe decent series but will bring back brain-dead drivel like joe millionaire for yet another round of killing the brain cells of the american has lost it imho
this movie was terrible at first i just read the plot summary and it looked ok so i watched it the acting was terrible it was like the actor were almost camera shy everything seemed fake i feel bad for edward furlong terminator was my favorite a few years ago i've watched it at least plot was also crap the writers were probably sleep deprived when they came up with the the plus side the good kind of bad movie the one you keep watching just to see how much worst could it will get so that later you can tell other people how you couldn't believe how terrible the movie think everybody should watch this so that then we could appreciate better other real movies
this movie has some beautiful sets and albert finney does a great job as the ruthless father the movie fails because jennifer jason leigh is too jumpy as the daughter and is no match whatever for olivia de far more nuanced mature rendering in the heiress the feminist-leaning conclusion also goes against the austere conclusion of the novel washington square whose author henry james savagely parodied feminism in some of his other novels as a fan of old hollywood and great literature i found this movie very disappointing
saw it at reel loud festival and was that it won the golden reel award i wasn't the only one considering the audience had mixed reactions to the piece i thought there were many other better flicks out there but then i learned that the judges were heavily rooted within the area of film theory and other artsy crap while the cinematography and editing are on par with many other shorts out there the storytelling is nothing more than your average student piece seems as though serious student films need to include one of these categories sex intrapersonal struggle and eventual suicide nick and kate cops out and includes all three please be more and it might be my opinion but the guy from montecito sounds a little fake does anyone else thing so
this is truly an awful movie and a waste of hours of your life it is simultaneously bland and offensive with nudity and lots and lots of violence however the nudity is not that exciting and the violence is repetitive and boring also the plot is flimsy at best the characters are unrealistic and undeveloped and the acting is some of the worst i have ever seen have heard that this movie is supposed to be funny but not i did not laugh once while watching it nor did i even crack a smile the makers of this film tried to combine a comedy movie with an action movie and they failed on both counts poorly made movies are funny because they are so bad but this is not one of them
loaded with fine actors i expected much more from deceiver than was delivered the plot is extremely contrived and manipulative the many flashbacks only add to the confusion believability flies out the window and with the ending becomes unbearable and downright ridiculous i would strongly advise anyone who likes their movie plots to be based on something that is at least possible to avoid deceiver because you will be very frustrated maybe i am just not hip enough to get it but my suspicion is that many others were totally confused by the story line and especially by the ending blurring the line between reality and lies simply does not work because the entire movie made no sense merk
i'm not sure if carpenter is looking to raise questions on abortion and make the really heavy-handed and obvious point that a woman should be allowed an abortion if satan is the father but it drags on and on ron perlman is laughable the baby is really stupid looking basically a crab with a baby head mounted on it you can pretty much see the material on the satan costume what a mess this episode has about five minutes of story and minutes of tedium very very bad and the ending is just ridiculous after learning his baby is dead does the devil destroy the abortion clinic and kill everyone in a huge bloody gory uproar no he just puts his head down and sulks out of the room terrible
i think i laughed twice the line where the main character says something about being from the streets and then i forget the other time i laughed it was probably in the has to be one of the thinnest movies ever doesn't hollywood realize that this kind of humor is degrading and sad really you can only insult yourself so many
i cannot believe this woodenly written and directed piece of cliche film got made there are about four good looking shots director should think about switching to still photography and it a strong cast is utterly wasted scenes repeatedly end at the least interesting moments and the script says nothing new please spare yourself this movie
reasons to watch the bo derek at looks good and occasionally gets naked she does a pretty good job playing an immature insecure year old beauty in many shots of a pretty greek peter hooten turns in the worst performance by an actor since brutus played friend in roman senate proceedings of march he delivers each and every line in a delightful baritone bellow turn down the volume whenever he speaks preferably all the way fantasies are sadly tame especially by standards a few turns in the bath and as a fully clothed the plot is skimpier than costumes
return to cabin by the lake does not in any way stand up to the original with only one main character returning for the sequal the film is not even worth the hours of your time i am a huge fan of the first film the story line and acting was really good but this is one movie that i will never again watch it is basically equal to what the sequals to urban legends and blair witch were like but with much worse acting i've personally seen better acting in soap operas it is so pitiful that you just have to laugh i in no way recommend this movie to anyone watching it will just detract from the first
this movie was absolutely pathetic a pitiful screenplay and lack of any story just left me watching three losers drool over bikini babes at times i felt like i was watching an episode of beavis and butthead i couldn't even sit through the whole movie emran hashmi disappoints and hrshitta bhatt is not impressive at all celina jaitley was not bad the only worthwhile part of the film is the spoof on anu malik and his obsession of shayaris it was pretty hilarious the songs sini ne and its remix version were really good you can always count on emran lip-locking and lip-synching a chartbuster all in all it seems emran doesn't have a good script from the bhatts to back him up this time
this series has its ups and occasional downs and the latter is the case here an agreeable amount of spatter with an inventive implementation of the baby weapons but the editing film is a seriously disjointed the film-making itself rougher than usual at times the action slows to a crawl as the camera follows the wordless wanderings of the cub who nearly gets lost early on all in all said a spaghetti eastern quality to the music and action that may win the approval of dedicated viewers this installment spends much of its time following the minor misadventures of the little boy who begins to stare into the abyss of death his father opened for him
this was so lame that i turned the dvd halfway through it was so weak i couldn't even pay full enough attention to tell you how far in i made i really wanted to believe that the depiction of the young carlito would be somewhat different i just couldn't buy it i don't really blame the actors because i think it was the script that may have fallen flat i did find myself laughing a few times but i don't think those lines were intended to be only saving grace is that i bought it in a dvd set and i would have paid the price i did for the original alone this is one of those cases when they should have let the classic stand alone
this movie was bad from the start the only purpose of the movie was that angela wanted to get a high body count the acting was horrible the killings were acted out very badly like when ally got stuffed down that toilet i guess it was in the abandoned cabin but when the end of the movie comes and molly and the other guy are in the cabin you see ally so angela must have gone in to get her the part that really got me was when the black girl and angela were in the cabin and angela took the guitar string and chocked her one it was horrible acting and two why wouldn't you just turn around and punch the bitch then when molly is getting chased by angela if you have the neigh why not just turn around and stab her so stupid this movie sucked
the only saving grace of this movie is that it serves as the end of the movie rating scale now if i see a movie that really stinks i say this movie was a real pecker i believe this movie is a perfect example of christina one dimensional acting horrible
everybody just seems to be raving about the subject and not really noticing how the movie was made the deaf mute guy is fine the underdog wins good the cricket aspect is great but the movie is average overall i think it could be made much much better than it plot is too predictable for a movie that is not based on a real life event i'm sure the movie could have been made more interesting the songs are just stuffed in there and i had to literally forward the scenes where the same thing would be shown from different acting though watchable
i was lying on my bed with a really bad cold or flu or whatever i figure maybe i'd kill some time watching some horror movies my mom bought for me a little while ago i wish i never picked this movie after i watched it i felt even more sick and i wanted to throw up i got better of course i did some research on dennis and i noticed that the dennis in the movie was nothing like the real one i hope that no one ever watches this movie but if they ever do don't eat or you'll feel the way i felt after i first watched it i think you would have a better time watching the santa claus at least that movie had better reviews on this site
this is a poor film by any standard the story in match point had a certain intrigue and the direction and writing a certain fascination allen mixing his own culture with that of the classic english murder and exploring what can be done with however has none of this it is poorly written the two leads are hopelessly wooden and the story itself has no interest at all the genre that it spoofs requires at least some sort of subplot with witty explanations and tie-ups are tarot cards and keys kept under french horns in locked delightful and witty versions of various hollywood genres of the jade rose of cairo etc have given us so much pleasure over the years even hollywood ending had a great central idea sadly his inspiration has deserted him this time
the only film i've ever walked out on amazing since i paid for myself and my date and i'm really cheap but my brain couldn't stand any more of the dreck being piled on particularly since i could have written funnier material while tie up and the beginning to the end this film offends worse it ain't funny it wasn't funny then and it sure ain't funny now but even worse is that this film represents the beginning of the end of really smart sophisticated comedy juvenile really sophomoric script and ideas began an era continues to this day where cheap laughs and sexual innuendo dominate the culture of comedy in olympics what high school kid hasn't thought of that the beginning of the end
omg this is one of the worst films iv ever seen and iv seen a lot i'm a film student i don't understand why angelina jolie would be in this movie did she need the money that badly i love aj and have seen almost everything shes ever been in so i watched this tick another one off it was soo bad not even good bad just bad bad it had or funny little moments but all in all it was bad n a waste of minutes i cant even say aj looked good in it because well she didn't the plot is predictable unless you r expecting a re-telling of romeo and juliet then its not all round disappointing maybe if your this could be a good film otherwise i really don't recommend it
the beginning of this movie was good it started to get really dumb after he told the people he wanted to kill himself i think if i came from a little town like that i would be offended after seeing this movie they made a lot of these people look dumb and crazy how could these people have so little to do that they follow him around all day a lot of times these people were telling him ways to kill himself like they were urging him to do it how can so many people have little respect for other people i also think they could have made a much better ending for this movie there were some good parts to this movie also some people might like it but i wouldn't recommend this to anyone
this movie begins with an ordinary funeral and it insists so hard on this ordinary funeral feel that i lost interest within minutes of watching and started skipping scenes it seems to me whomever made this movie is afflicted to the extent of becoming trapped in a permanent morbid trance unable to contemplate anything else but death and destruction well i ain't one of the dark kids from southpark i want a movie that within minutes gets me well into an interesting story i won't sit and watch minutes of nothing but preparations for a funeral my grandma on her last years was fascinated by funerals perhaps she might have enjoyed this movie
this film is awful give me the dentist anytime can you believe that one of the main tv stations here in arabia had this as their christmas film i can only assume they expected to entertain the crowds with dudley moore rather than this the last time i looked at my hot water bottle it had more acting better plot more drama and a lot more interest than this waste of celluloid don't even watch it if you're drunk
this hamlet made for one of the boringest episodes ever i am not a shakespear fan but i do not believe he ever intended his works to be this slow paced and drab it is also one of the hardest movies to find because there are so many hamlets listed like i said though this one is quite boring it is in black and white the pacing is slow and there is minimal scenery the actors are all dubbed too so that doesn't help this is the one mst i can't watch in one sitting cause the way the guy playing hamlet says his lines can put anyone to sleep
the main complaint with this film is the fact that i can not tell who is who no racism intended but these asians look all the same i can tell somewhat of the story but heck thats about as far as it goes the peoples identities are not a mystery if they were a mystery i would care about them instead i wasn't them off the screen of wide shots and silent emotionless faces occupy this movie heck is it boring not only do i not know these people but they are just sitting production is typical chinese john woo terrible video with blotched scenes this looks only slightly better than andy fulltime killer was a great movie you would think with a decent budget they could at least make it look like hollywood i didn't know the chinese had these art-house beatniks
ok another film bought by me and joe swatman ok this isn't the worst film i've reviewed this week but it still sucked royaly we had a lot of fun watching this piece of monster jigsaw is a mish mash of all these dysfunctional students ideas u just know ur in for trouble when someone equips him with a buzzsaw and a sawed of shotgun the film wasn't as gory as we hoped i mean on of the deaths is a heart attack again i think the acting sucks sum of the actors must be porn stars and one get into her undies for what ever reason absolute worst part is the ending it leaves it open for a bit of a jigsaw but thats never gunna happen lets face mock much fun we had mocking it acting generally
i don't understand how of us receive such a high rating i thought that the first half dragged on and the second half didnt make sense followed by an unresolved climax which was not worth the trouble however i did like jared harris performance of john lennon which was worth the wasted hours
i too like dafoe as an actor but i wasted a few hours of my life actually watching this film i still cant believe i managed to watch it in its entirety was there actually a point to the film and the ending well im glad i never paid to see this awful pointless piece of pathetic excuse of a not sure without hunting the facts out but is dafoe married or seeing the awful actress in this film in real life if so was it an attempt to kick start her career if so im afraid it must have post this in the hope i can actually put someone off watching this film even if person takes heed of my comments and decides they would much rather watch paint drying i will feel i have made some good in the world if only i had had the same advice
how can barry levinson possibly assemble white-hot comedy talents ben stiller and jack black the gorgeous rachel weisz old pro christopher walken and still deliver such a humourless and black are friends until the latter invents a spray to make dog mess vanish and becomes a conspicuous consuming premises is thin but sound enough in the right hands to have been a springboard for some great bitching between the two stars but all concerned overplay every hand every chance they and black are simply not funny for way too much of the time weisz looks sensational as always but is criminally underused and with the exception of walken as a batty barfly who urges character to take revenge a turgid trudge to the end of this strained farce
this movie is chilling reminder of bollywood being just a parasite of hollywood bollywood also tends to feed on past blockbusters for furthering its vinod chopra made this movie with the reasoning that a cocktail mix of deewar and on the waterfront will bring home an oscar it turned out to be rookie the idea of the title is inspired from the elia kazan classic in the original brando is shown as raising doves as symbolism of must move out of shadow if it needs to be taken seriously
this is going to be the most useless comment i have ever put down but yet i must do it to warn you about the atrocity to cinema that dead is it is not only the very worst chapter of the nightmare series but is right up there with the worst horror sequel of all time it was boring pointless and nearly death free the horrible ending and over-the-top corny kills are enough to drive this film into the ground however it doesn't stop there just add bad acting a terrible script and a number of cheesy cameos and you've got yourself this heaping pile of guano no wonder why freddy as always played by robert englund has made two postmortem appearances i would too if i went out like that this is a strictly fans only movie don't stare at our shame
the great ecstasy of robert carmichael is bad film in every way the script the dreary pace the lack of depth in any character the pointless sub-plots the dreadful acting the needless climax all make this possibly the worst film i've ever seen i found nothing likable enjoyable or intellectually stimulating in any imagine the film makers thought they were making something clever and dark with its moody lighting long protracted silences and vaguely haunting classical soundtrack if so they failed utterly it just bored me and i wish i had never watched at all costs
at least among those movies with votes or more nominated for best screenplay written directly for the screen brenda blethyn nominated for best actress in a leading role nominated for best picture i always disagree with many of the oscar picks but this movie might very well be the worst movie of all time to be honored by the academy the writing and acting were both horrible perfomance in particular was one of the worst i've ever seen and probably the most over-rated acting performance of all time awful movie not worthy of the big screen and not worthy of any cable or television channel that has ever played it including i saw it i am only thankful i didn't actually pay to see one of the most over-rated movies of all time
when i went and saw this movie i had great expectations but i had so wrong this movie was exactly as every other horror movies a virus zombies etc exactly as resident evil and many many other movies but the difference with this and other movies is that the story is very week bad actors and boring music the photo is ok but the rest is total crap don't see this horror movie go and see the ring or any other movie much more of a story i hope they will stop making horror movies who has a virus and the virus spread and make people to zombies we have seen enough of that the only good thing in the movie is when they are standing at a roof and shoot famous infected celebrities
this movie is a crappy and forgettable sean connery vehicle the performances are generally crappy especially by capshaw fishburne and the usually solid ed harris connery seems miscast as a harvard academic the movie absolutely gets worse as it goes along it is a third rate mystery that becomes extremely contrived by the time it unravels the movie squanders an excellent supporting cast george plimpton also turns up in a minor role to add some gravitas to connery as they debate the death penalty the violence and the atmosphere pepper a third rate that is manipulation to the highest degree the scripting and direction are extremely poor charisma and screen presence are the only virtue manipulative violent and ridiculous avoid it
when his in-laws are viciously murdered by a gang of thugs a young deputy is ordered to escort his mute friend forced to take the rap by the gang to tucson for trial and ending up having to face the real killers along the decoy is a real-life decoy sent to video stores to lure you away from better films talky illogical slow and ultimately very some good costumes sets and photography but nothing else is good about this vanity project from justin kreinbrink who apparently had too much money on his used to make westerns like this that were under an hour long trim this of about half length and you might have something watchable
i've now written reviews for several of the moh episodes and this is among the worst an interesting premise at the beginning is completely abandoned by the time the credits roll if watching people things they never would in real life amuses you check out the basement then this is your show except not amusing or entertaining just extent of the virus is never ever showed i can very much overlook the fact that it affects men only as the resulting situation is very very frightening but then things deteriorate as daughter lets obviously deranged dad into the home and ultimately dies at his hands the woman flees north and runs into a few tens situations then some sort of spirit or alien or something appears and saves her that make you go huh or something then she is huddling for warmth the these directors are mailing this tripe in
if you didn't live in the or didn't listen to rapper ever this movie might be ok for you but any for any fan or any single person who ever listened to rap this movie was boring and there was no point in the movie where i said thats interesting or i didn't know that another thing that bugged me was it made it look like anything in his life he did was very easy there was no struggle he made jail look easy selling drugs and even rapping it wasn't realistic i think if the movie where released in about years from now it might have more of an impact maybe good rap movies hustle and flow get rich or die trying not notorious
extremely thin plot of satanic rituals or some such mumbo-jumbo provides the hokey excuse to thread copious amounts of sex scenes together straight vanilla sex masturbation lesbianism bestiality incest and a few other sexual all get their time in the spotlight here the problem is the storyline is so dull that the rampant sexuality gets pretty tedious after awhile who knew that a film with an intimate girl encounter could be so damn boring well now i candy venessa hidalgo shows all helga line provides on display quite frequently women viewers get the occasional grade dvd extras trailers for pick up legend of eight samurai don't answer the phone prime evil sister street fighter the same dvd holds a second feature movie evil eye
i don't remember seeing another movie as bad as this this movie about a medical examiner who investigates his mysterious death in a car accident has the complete receipt for a bad movie bad acting boring story lack of suspense poor humor and no drama i remembered seeing this movie on pax a tv station notable for dishing out low-budgeted and campy made-for-tv movies such as this one tv movies of course do not have the edge factor or the suspense as movies from the big screen but this movie sure hit all sour tastes the makers of this movie have missed out on an opportunity to making receipe for murder a great tv movie the title does offer some if you want a good recipe don't watch this movie this movie alone can kill your tv f
what happened to peter bogdanovich once a brilliant director a trail blazer is now scraping the very bottom is this the same man who directed the last picture show here he takes a somewhat interesting farfetched premise and turns it into bubble gum that loses flavor the moment you take the first bite dunst is not bad but izzard is miscast as chaplin and all the other actors seem to have been cast for their looks and not because they were right for the part too bad i'll go rent paper moon again
the dukes of hazzard will academy awards best actor and actress the persons who can say with a straight face that this was a great movie was a torture to watch so sad how an weekly half hour entertainment was destroyed by these only good thing about this crap was the car i remember when daisy was a real threat to look the moron that decided that jessica simpson is hot we know she can't act but come on in the tv show daisy was a fox and members who contributed in these waste of time please please please don't even think about makin a sequel a prequel or anything got do with a former tv gave a empty dvd so this movie could be burned me i sat trough it and i want my money back
phantasm class phantasm phantasm though i would love to stick up for this film i quite simply can't the movie seems to have sold out first bad signs come when the video has trailers for other films at the start the others did not also too many pointless characters prime examples the kid is a crack shot funny initially but soon you want him dead the woman who uses karate to fight off the balls not gonna work or rather shouldn't and the blooming zombies the hell are they doing there there no link to them in the other phatasms also there is a severe lack of midgets running only good bits are the cracking start and of course reggie spoiler coming me this film seems like a filler between ii and iv as extra characters just leave at the end so can continue with main in very very disappointing
we rented five movies for new eve weekend and watched this one first all i can say is that there was no place to go but up after watching this one it was pointless and vulgar harvey script must have been easy to write just make two out every three words a curse word andie mcdowell is surprisingly good in a character roll but the movie has nothing else to recommend it
the title should have been the walker the guy expend of the movie walking he doesn't know what he wants or what he is go through life stealing peoples identity for nothing he gets no benefit no money nothing pretending to be another body was able to understand why he was pretending to be somebody only thing that was clear in this movie is that he love his father and was a good son but the rest was be director is a looser that would like to be somebody else but what he really should do is to get a real job because after his movie i don't think he has a chance to make as a movie producer
this film was a yawn from titles to credits boring to the point of tedium and the acting is wooden and stilted admittedly this was director richard jobson directing debut but who on earth green-lit a script as poorly developed as this one looks like another money down the drain government project screen are credited surprise surprise i nearly fell asleep three times and my review will unfortunately have to be more restrained than this one please please mister jobson what ever you've been doing prior to directing this sedative of a film go back to it
this is without a doubt one of the worst movies ever i emphasize ever made worse my old hero dolph is in it and starring it jesus the story is actually quite good but the way carried out made even my body hurt the fighting scenes for starters are about as well choreographed as a fight between two drunks slugging it out in the gutter the actors except for dolph who kinda sucks also perform so badly you help but wonder if their reason for being there is that all friends of the director who by the way must have been absent most if not all of the time this is million spent in an unimaginable way because by the look of the effects and scenery the cost be a cent above
this was quite possibly the worst movie i have ever seen i watched it with a large group of friends and after it was over not a one of us understood the plot aside from the lack of plot the acting was atrocious the special effects were not so special and the writing was absolutely horrible the only redeeming factor is that so incredibly bad that quite funny you can't help but laugh at a zombie being run over while actors are spewing crappy dialogue i wouldn't recommend this film to anyone looking for a good movie but something that a group of friends can get together and have a good laugh about now a running joke among my friends and i out of
a handful of nonprofessional actors are terrorized by a prehistoric creature this creature appears in about thirty seconds of marginal stop-motion animation but oh how you will long for that margin when for the rest of the movie the animation is replaced by production assistants waving around an inner tube with teeth no time for terror when this movie is hijacked halfway through by these comic relief boat rental doofuses who suddenly become the lead characters but again you gotta admit watching them try to be funny is better than plodding around after the sheriff only at the end one of them gets eaten and the other one is left sitting on a rock crying tears of loneliness no fun
very unnecessary movie with characters that are acting so unsympathetically that i really didn't care who would fare the best was that the purpose of the film to portray some smooth talking cold-hearted new york city folks no romance here no comedy either acting is very flat and a very predictable plot what annoyed me the most was this constant joking with quotes from classic movies man can't you see that the more you quote the less significant your own movie becomes try to be original yourself a small budget is no excuse at all first-time director neither crappy crappy crappy no wonder it only cost me one buck
this movie had a imdb rating of so i expected much more from it it starts out funny and endearing with an energy that feels spontaneous but before the movie is half-way through it begins to drag and everything becomes sickingly predictable the characters in the office were delightful in the first third of the movie but we get to know them a little too well they become caricatures not real people at all this is the same story i've seen hundreds of times only told here with slightly different circumstances the thing is i could stomach another predictable love story if only the dialog weren't so only thing that could be worse is if the characters had inconsistent and unbelievable motivations and unfortunately that was also the case with dead letter office hopefully this movie will end up in the dead movie office soon
this movie is by far the worst movie ever made if you have to create a film costarring the guy who plays lars in heavyweights than don't make the damn film i have to say that i could watch leprechaun in space times before i could watch the trailer for this pos of a movie adam sandler should be restricted from any movie after this disgrace watching this movie is like a mix of listening to cher and willingly putting your dick in a blender anyone with half of a brain cell will realize that this movie is not worth a dime if i had an extra dollar and had to spend it i'd give it to the support lorraina bobbitt foundation before buying this movie
with these people faking so many shots using old footage and gassing animals to get them out not to mention that some of the scenes were filmed on a created set with actors to believe old film of countries is nice but the animal abuse and degradation of natives is painful to watch in these films i know racism is ok in these old films but there is more to that to make this couple lose credibility portrayed as fliers they never flew their planes martin johnson was an ex-vaudevillian used friends like jack london for financial gain while stiffing them of royalties denying his apparent depression using her as a cute prop all this makes these films unbearable they were by no means the first to travel to these lands or the first to write about them he was ok as a filmmaker and photographer but about it
the omen the awakening is a made-for-television sequel to the original the omen film instead of satan possessing the body of a little boy he possesses the body of a little girl adopted by rich parents who is bullied at school and who ends up getting revenge against those who do her wrong the film seems to struggle with any horror factor and a lot of the events that happen are simply silly rather than particularly frightening and it is difficult to believe that this little girl is satan even with all of the events that surround it i just did not find this film very suspenseful or frightening particularly when compared to the original
what a terrible movie rotten tomatoes had a good rating for this too don't be fooled by the positive comments it wasn't scary it wasn't funny it wasn't clever it won't even hold your attention i just wasted hours of my life viewing this crap-fest the computer generated monster was interesting to see the first couple times after about minutes it no longer entertained the dialogue was terrible must be a translation thing another negative that stood out was the idiot americans were portrayed and they were all lacking character intelligence and judgment now i will write a couple of lines to pad this since we have to have the employees at the video store should have slapped me for bringing this title to the counter
this is one of those movies which makes you think would hulk the real american hogan have done the same frankly i don't think so and he'd have been right i'm italian i cannot go proud of my country for many reasons but i wouldn't have rowed for another team french for example simply because i'm in love with juliette binoche besides the protagonist doesn't fall in love desire with a british girl at the end of the movie but with a fellow countrywoman so why rowing against yale as far as acting is concerned well all the players act very poorly and then you know i hated that dead poets society atmosphere in fact another movie i hate
this movie is nothing like office space except in the premise office space was hilarious i would not recommend this movie to anyone as i laughed not once during the entire film mr self-indulgent tirades quickly become more annoying than jason alexanders in the same room if you decide to see this movie use a free rental or watch it at someone house so you can leave if necessary
i'd give this a negative rating if i could i went into this movie not expecting much but i had an open mind the whole thing is stupid the snakes are obviously fake and the first two things they bite are a boob and a guys johnson oh how original if i were a year old boy i might laugh at that i have no idea how this movie became so popular worst thing i've ever seen i wasn't entertained it wasn't wasn't even bored i wasn't anything it wasn't even so bad it was good just bad ridiculous actually please do not waste your money on this movie don't even rent this movie no clue how getting such a high rating
there are no reasons to watch this movie should you have won and extreme amount of money and having spent your time discovering every pleasure and have come to a point where by chance you are at a loose end and have some time to kill that would ever happen then get this movie from the video shop you can find it and put up with the assistant laughing at you then ask for this movie be prepared however for you mind to be invaded by extremely wooden acting by absolutely everyone fact the best acting was by the people who said nothing oliver reed tops off his grand career by playing a drunk go figure but wait i forgot there is one reason to watch this movie claudia udy showing her chest sadly no other reason than that
power rangers the moronic merchandising television kids show from the has got to be the most pointless and ridiculous television show ever exactly is the point of this show anyway other than to sell second rate plastic nonsense to children there is nothing even remotely redeeming or interesting about this show in at the costumes which look like spandex gone mullet style hair earrings and fashions of the early look completely ridiculous these this show at all costs
this one of my favorites not really any good but great to laugh at the dialogue can become incredibly ludicrous and poorly acted manji can we ask you a few questions sure we think you can help us with the answers any fighting is more or less surrealistic make sure to watch for brock the oafy white guy who attacks the main characters he only has two lines but one of the best guys in the movie
in this forgettable trifle the norma shearer plays a fluttery girlish socialite in monte carlo caught in a tussle between george sanders and robert taylor it would be tempting to blame this failure on the dull talky script or director george cukor who never seems interested in livening up the generally comatose state mostly though the fault of shearer herself who desperately wanted to keep playing young parts as long as she could get away with it inadvertently this makes her cardboard lover a bizarre monument to an aging vanity
what a huge pile of dung shot-on-video crappy camcorder not digital pile of garbage it is without a doubt the stupidest thing ever made the fact that this crap was actually released is completely asanine everyone who sees it will become stupider for having watched it seriously i felt like it killed several brain cells after i watched this garbage the positive reviews of this were obviously made by the filmmaker i use the term very loosely himself his family and friends because no normal person with the intelligence of a squirrel would honestly like this waste of life trust me stay the hell away from this video you'll thank me for it avoid it like herpes
i have walked out of about movies my entire life this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen i don't know how i sat through an hour of it i must have been in a coma that night i saw it in the theatre when it came out years ago i couldn't even remember the name but i knew that penelope ann miller starred in it it must have really affected me to be wasting my time commenting on it today yech vomit barf
after seconds you already realize that there was no real budget for this cheap knock-off the story is taken from great movies like texas chainsaw massacre and hills have eyes i like those kind of movies even if they're duplicated well turn timber falls carver side sho is hard to watch the actors are really bad the dialogue is cheesy and the music is stupid and totally misplaced you do not care at all what happens to the characters the so-called bad guys are also not interesting at all and rather stereotypical so how about the blood and gore well there is some although it is rather cheap and the action is executed very poorly points just for the gore and blood but do understand that this is hardly worth a look even for the gore-hounds
this has to be one of the worst films of the when my friends i were watching this film the target audience it was aimed at we just sat watched the first half an hour with our jaws touching the floor at how bad it really was the rest of the time everyone else in the theatre just started talking to each other leaving or generally crying into their popcorn that they actually paid money they had earnt working to watch this feeble excuse for a film it must have looked like a great idea on paper but on film it looks like no-one in the film has a clue what is going on crap acting crap costumes i can't get across how embarrasing this is to watch save yourself an hour a bit of your life
the original was a good movie i bought it on tape and have watched it several times and though i know that sequels are not usually as good as the original i certainly wasn't expecting such a bomb the romance was flat the sight gags old the spoken humor just wasn't this may not have been the worst movie i've ever seen but it comes close
is there anything worse than a comedy film that lacks humor the answer is yes one that fails to generate any interest throughout the picture the premise is not too bad a naive front man for an illegal business but this is a potboiler with a poor script and screenplay and just does not this considered a good b in hard to imagine the only positive aspect of the picture is the cast which contains several well-known faces from the and such as warren hymer vince barnett and robert armstrong always dismiss richard cromwell as the weakling who got gary cooper killed in lives of a bengal lancer so i wasn't counting recommend this one and gave it a rating of if you have a choice get a root canal
this movie was probably about as silly as the naked gun was supposed to be case in in order to fake her drowning roberts is secretly taking swimming lessons at the ywca after her death the ywca calls her husband at work to give their condolences hello how did they get his work before she leaves town she drops her wedding ring in the toilet days or even weeks later her hubby finds it in the john does this mean the toilet was never no explanation is given on how she is paying for her mothers care in the retirement home she did it behind her rich husbands towards the end of this tiresome film roberts suspects her husband is in the house instead of running for her life she runs to the kitchen instead to see if the cans are stacked neatly
i had very low expectations for this alleged re-imagining of the original and they weren't even met what were they thinking they weren't please don't waste your time on this hollywood trash fest clip your nails balance your checkbook do anything besides watch this remember if you rent stuff like this it will only ensure they make more
to die for was just another feature that made an appearance on cable ad nasuem during the early nineties the only thing notable about this feature was the last movie duane jones appeared in other than that no reason to watch this vampire flick unless you like pseudo chick flicks masquerading as a horror film a tired vampire longs for love and searches the back streets of looking for it will he succeed or will vlad just strike out again like he has for the last movie must have been big because a couple of sequels soon followed they're so bad they make this one look like a classic i know this is a movie about vampires but the film makers could have used to recommended by me because i didn't like said
this is a great movie i love the series on tv and so i loved the movie one of the best things in the movie is that helga finally admits her deepest darkest secret to arnold that was great i loved it it was pretty funny too a great movie doy
this is the kind of film that everyone involved with should be embarrassed over poor directing over the top acting and a plot that rambles on with no point other than to show violence i thought when i first saw it that it would be perhaps a satire of the media and how it shows violence but not i'm not sure what makes the film worse oliver stone does his worst directing ever from scenes where woody face morphs for no reason or robert downey dreadful performance as wayne gale who is a reporter who seems totally bonkers this movie is simply a mess
there have been very few films i have not been able to sit through i made it through battle field earth no problem but this this is one of the single worst films ever to be made i understand whoopi goldberg tried to get of acting in it i do not blame her i would feel ashamed to have this on a resume i belive it is a rare occasion when almost every gag in a film falls flat on face well it happens here not to mention the sfx look for the dino with the control cables hanging out of it rear end halfway through the film i was still looking for a plot i never found one save yourself the trouble of renting this and save minutes of your life
i watched the movie and was dismayed to say the least that the movie failed to communicate with me as an audience the language would put to shame the street plot a father forcing none of his son to marry seems far-fetched idea of a grandmother asking her grand kid to mess up with an enemy would only draw feeble i was waiting the whole movie for a laugh and laugh i did on my stupidity to waste hours to convince myself that the movie is not even worth a first it saves your time
well what to seen the film i still have to wonder what the hell the point of it all really was camera moves in the courtyard at one point i had to look away from the screen i was feeling physically sick round and round and round you get the very strange accents at many points those that should know your getting in for free or being paid to watch it or your partner is about to make you paint the house or something then forget it
i have never understood the appeal of this show the acting is poor jo rupp being a notable exception the plots of most episodes are trite and uninspiring the dialogue is weak the jokes unfunny and it is painful to try and sit through even half an episode furthermore the link between this show and the is extremely tenuous beyond the style of dress and the scenery and background used for the show seems to be nothing more than a modern sitcom with the same old unfunny clich√©d scripts that modern sitcoms have dressed up as depicting a show from twenty years ago in the hope that it will gain some nostalgic viewers or something like that both happy days and the wonder years employ the same technique much more effectively and are actually a pleasure to watch in contrast to this horrible pathetic excuse for a show
if this movie was written directed and produced with the intention of creating a bad movie cult classic it might say might have been a hit have you ever sat and watched a movie that was so absolutely awful that it becomes fascinating in terms of its faults well this is it every one of the acting cast should be nominated for worst acting performance awards it would be hard to find another film with this kind of production budget that contains so little of any value whatsoever the whole thing from the opening scenes defies logic dialogue is completely unbelievable and illogical ditto for the behaviour and general storyline of the film itself what is really mind boggling is that some buffoons in a boardroom actually made decisions to spend money on this piece of trash wow
i have to confess right off that i have never been a fan of rodney dangerfield indeed from me he gets no respect i watched this only because my wife wanted to see it and found exactly what i expected a stupid story without any real humour full of lame crude jokes and a totally ridiculous plot revolving around a plans to build a ski resort in utah that just didn't capture my attention at addition to dangerfield the film starred a weak cast including the likes of andrew dice clay and the totally over the hill john byner didn't even know he was still around until i saw his name in the credits for truly is a dangerfield
alright i got passed the horrible acting i got passed the fact that lil kim was blasting some cannons and her arms or hands weren't moving i got passed the weaves i got passed the colored is what killed it for me in the scene where the four roses were sitting at the table arguing lisa-raye and monica calhoun stand up and and then lil kim gets up to break up any hostilities by saying whoa whoa whoa hold up chill out here for a hot second i am a fan of the western movie genre and i never heard anyone talk slang like this in any of clint anyone thinks this movie deserves over a rating please tell me another movie worse than gang of through
i have an awful pan-and-scan videotape of boom and i want to see it in all its widescreen glory so i voted and hope you will too together we can pull this movie down into the pits of cinematic dross and hope that someone will see an opportunity for big money in releasing boom in its cut extended version the movie is one of my howling favorites you just look at the people involved the director the actors the cameraman and you say to yourself yep i guess you can fool some of the people for a lot of time producers considering the dvd release of boom should note that everywhere been shown there have been sellout crowds in the theaters but it hasn't been up to frostbite falls yet
to be completely haven't seen that many western films but i've seen enough to know what a good one by far the worst western on the planet off there black people in the wild west come on who ever thought that this could be a cool off the wall movie that everyone would love were slightly no no completely in that day and age women especially black women were not prone to be carrying and or using whats with the asian chick speaking perfect english if the setting is isn't where your going evil gay chick was too much the movie was just crap from the don't get me wrong i'm not racist or white either so don't get ticked after reading this but this movie is the worst presentation of black people i have ever seen
is totally unrealistic lacks a plot and was basically only made to see stars portray themselves the most suspenseful scene in the movie was when shabana azmi is in the shower and then we see her tv playing the shower scene from psycho this movie actually expected users to believe that naseeruddin character has a good enough memory to remember where certain shots were fired and how the end the killer spills his guts to shabana azmi long enough to allow naseeruddin character to run up and shoot is a little humorous a little in the beginning to hear the director and cast members throwing insults at each other and hearing shabana azmi exclaim oh a baaaaaaaaaaad out of out of
just watched it me and my better half could not believe how awful and badly acted it was if anyone else thinks its good then you must be easily pleased i actually gave up a night out to watch this its all been done before ie hostel springs to mind but at least that did not make you cringe with the bad acting and lack of story line same old stuff read so much about this film i even recommended it to my mates my said it was good no more or reeling back in disgust than your average scary movie it has to be said please don't bother with this movie get mary poppins now thats scary i'm off out now go to the cinema and watch something scarier than this little miss sunshine maybe
how did this ripoff of being there ever get to be so loved people say proof that a decent honest man can succeed despite lack of intelligence they're wrong the movie is proof that luck is everything hope your friend invests all your money in apple and not atari hope your shrimp boat is the only one out at sea when a storm breaks hope that you don't die of shock when you're luckily shot in the buttocks and not in the back hope you don't get aids from your wife this movie is also politically reactionary all who rebel against societal convention lose their legs do drugs beat their girlfriends or die young in addition the product placement in this film and dr pepper is shameless an emotionally manipulative film that is very very empty
the only reason i didn't score this a one is that sibrel does show that he is adept at the technical aspects of making a film it is a technically adept having been said this is a film based on lies and distortions that are quite easily disproven most of the documentary is spent using propaganda techniques to bash the space program rather than actual fact and irrefutable proof that the landings were faked is easily refuted if you know anything about orbital do not recommend watching this but if you do see it at google video for free don't let bart sibrel profit from your curiosity
why do all movies on lifetime have such anemic titles an unexpected love ooh how provocative this much i know would have been better the film is nothing special real people don't really talk like these characters do and the situations are really hackneyed the straight woman who turns lesbian seemed more butch than the lesbian character if you wanna watch two hot women kiss in a very discreet fashion you might enjoy this although it seems like it was written by someone who doesn't really get out in the world to observe people why am i wasting my time writing about it
i vowed a long time ago to never ever watch a movie that has anyone who ever was a regular cast member of saturday night live i didn't rent corky romano but i was forced by my unfailing good manners to watch it for half an hour then my good manners failed stupid not funny tedious not hilarious bad not good that in a nutshell is all i can say for this video
solid comedy entertainment with musical interludes it generates a fast pace that carries proceedings along in zestful tempo through a maze of humorous and chiller complications boris karloff bela lugosi and peter lorre form a strong setup of sinister villainy the script contains all the standard mystery film props-sliding panels secret passageways thunder and lightning and poisoned blow-darts karloff lugosi and lorre go in for heavy leers and obvious melodramatics of the gaslit era kay kyser and his band offered great entertainment for the people living in the who were trying to forget about the of world war ii
i saw this movie with the intention of not liking it i sure didn't one of those movies that seems to have been made exclusively for the oscars music throughout the film in almost every single frame almost no profanity set in a time long gone sepia-toned imagery pretentious title no sex and a genius that explains everything he thinks and concludes in so that we stupid audience get it one thing that amused me though is the fact that they spelled the nobel price wrong instead they call the nobel-price after an actual person called alfred nobel the noble-price jesus how can one make such a mistake in such a big production supposedly based on a true story what a sham what were you and the others thinking ron
the only redeeming quality of this film is the actual this movie was terrible the acting was ridiculously bad and the set design was cheesy and very tacky the story was decent but it was very hard to watch due to all the horrid acting i wouldn't recommend watching this only redeeming quality of this film was that the actors were somewhat ryan bauer the man who plays the soap opera star some of the editing was well done but there are continuity errors all over the just starting to get sick and tired of watching gay movies that are we get a good one soon
okay so the introduction with its hokey offer of a free coffin to anyone who dies of fright during the film is so lame funny and so the first skull scene is so drawn out and un-suspenseful funny the actual plot of the movie is somewhat decent at least a little bit of genuine food for thought in the behavior of the characters and the plot twist is decent as horror flicks go the acting is average not truly bad this movie doesn't quite fall flat in the way a movie would not terrible enough to get the lowest rating or even second lowest if i just read the screenplay i'd say there was potential for this to be a decent movie just that the horrid direction and production that ruin the movie so a bad movie but there are much worse ones out there
i was so disappointed by this show after hearing and reading all the hoopla about it how it was a ground breaking show and all sorts of wild promises if quality i tried to watch a letdown the acting was way forced and exaggerated the story made very little sense as for any hint of the vaunted look into teenagers lives i could only see a paltry attempt that had as much reality to it as a reality are wondering why there are so many negative comments about this show the reason is that really not all that good and beating the drums over quality on this show only serves to attract attention to how poorly made it is
to sat how awful the shield is you'd have to write pages and pages so suffice it to say that it is a monument to bad directors go awry should have been the title of this production indeed directors are supposed to infuse their work with a sense of visual style and story-telling that propels the story is constantly shaking the camera and playing with the zoom lens a style how is it propelling the story forward of course also the editing by random numbers nonsense apparently become hip to just cut guess too much work to do good that made it too much work for most people to watch the shield which languished as one of the most over-hyped and unwatched shows of all time
when i first saw a small scene of it in some announcements i thought the show would be entertaining to watch the little robot guy does look kinda cute the style of animation does look sort of familiar to some classic shows before the show aired i studied it through some sources there i did became slightly dismayed the three children gus and lola are voiced appropriately but robotboy is an exception it would have been a lot nicer if he were to be portrayed by a young lad one good example is robot jones a robot character from whatever happened to robot jones the show isn't bad really but the way robotboy is inappropriately portrayed is my only criticism thus i don't watch it much
the biggest one that bugs the hell out of me is that they say zues takes dutch commands but she is speaking german to him the languishes are completely different its like saying well he takes french commands and start talking belushi gives more the feeling of being a comedy actor not a detective in the slightest the role just doesn't fit him even if its mend to be a many stuff typical comment or you don't look at those things i think it could be a nice movie to watch if its ever on tv but i wouldn't suggesting renting it
this tv movie goes to show that bad films do exist the only reason i saw this was it was covered on a ktma super bowl at the superdome in new orleans however no football is played whatsoever and we see the behind the scenes look at basically nothing with the many stars in this film it made no difference i really don't know why i watched this
i rented new best friend hoping for a movie similar to enjoyable teen thrillers such as gossip and the curve instead new best friend is much more like the in crowd in which there are no thrills and the acting is incredibly phony new best friend is boring and the events during the movie are the same skip this a waste of time
having watched both the lion king and lion king ii and enjoyed both thoroughly i thought lion king might be worth watching what a disappointment disney must be getting desperate for now that they lost the deal with they just picked up some bits of footage that were left on the floor garbage can and glued them together to make buck unlike lk i ii both of which had strong story movie hardly has a story at all while the characters and animation are always fun to look at there is simply not enough material here for a movie some of the bits could have been good disk fillers on the original shame on you for putting this trash out to make a quick time take the time and effort and put our an enduring work
i'll say this director is all about raw most of us are not ready to confront head-on images of sex suicide murder and people relieving themselves are constantly bombarding the viewer which makes me wonder if the director was trying to communicate the concept of relief or release although i don't think that i could ever see this movie again i will say that the director does have a good eye there were some really nice shots and picture moments in the film fans the wire fish in their hair but the story left me needing more in the since that we were left asking ourselves what the heck did we just if you have a tendency to gag or vomit see this film
if you were to judge based on the movie alone the committee that gave the stage musical a chorus line a pulitzer prize and broadway audiences that kept the war horse running for years were all on heavy narcotics because one singular sensation this film certainly is possessed anyone to think that richard attenborough was the right fit for this material utterly mystifies me but he makes a musical that is almost entirely about movement just sit on the screen like a lump of content with the original score the way it was originally written someone decided that what the film really needed was a brand new song to give the movie some zip thus we are assaulted with the surprise surprise well surprise surprise the song stinks and so does the d
i'm glad some people liked this but i hated this film it had a very good idea for a story line but where it ended it was badly written badly acted and badly it had some interesting plot points but they were just skipped over too fast the writers needed to realize what to keep in and expand on these bits like lying about why she was kidnapped and ditch the dross instead it was going on seconds later they tell film had no suspense and i was bored from start to end i just wanted it to go and rent misery or best laid plans if you want suspense or twists that keep you guessing to the end
i am not a big fan of rajnikant in the first place but baba was a huge disappointment in between an awful storyline the action and songs were only mediocre the storyline becomes very preachy instead of running for office like ntr or mgr rajni almost appeared to be running as tamil next big guru my wife tells me that since this film came out rajni swore off doing any more were lucky initially to have bought babu oldie by sivajiganeshan online by accident when trying to buy this was a great film which made up for having bought this it makes baba look even worse by
every movie from the thirties is dated but if you were to watch only john ford movies it would seem more dated than if you watched others grand hotel is comparatively modern melodrama with ford always the hard-sell of nobility the joads always the over-emphasis of some badness always the poorly crafted awkward and obvious scripts this is no exception just a rather belabored device to deliver sentiment and sentiment is all this has going for ford does here doesn't make me appreciative of lincoln it just makes me wonder how the states were ever settled by the population of complete morons depicted here ford went on to make decent movies this is too dated to be anything but bad it feels entirely false fonda with a fake nose is bizarre and no one from illinois would pronounce the trailing s or say shonuff
i have anticipated the various sci-fi and thriller type movies this summer but was so disappointed about this particular film while some people walked out of the film i decided to stay only to laugh along with the other moviegoers at the acting lack of suspense ridiculous ending and difficult to follow story line i found myself almost as confused as the main character in the film the only redeeming quality of the film was the soundtrack this is one of those budding star films which they later regret doing in retrospect i wouldn't even rent this one let alone pay more than to see
it is only robert de niro film which i really hates it is stupid film with horrible acting course not de niro for me brian de palma must do his mafia films as always like scarface or the untouchables i also loved de mission impossible de niro worked with palma two different times too greetings and the wedding party i though that the wedding party was ok too didn't watch greetings is really bad and unfunny there are no any scene where i can smile for even one time film lost a chance to be a funny style even a little bit in a be black baby scene and also i don't like the scene where a sexual organ appeared so it is one of the worst film i have ever seen just worst i hate that
what a terrible terrible film one of the worst movies i have seen in my life i usually love movies like this the whole a guy meets an eccentric woman who he likes but he happens to already be involved with someone who not right for him i expected something predictable and i didn't mind the movies are always entertaining mixing the right amount of romance with comedy but not this one every single joke falls flat and the romance makes me want to vomit the title character is one of the most please kill me characters that i have ever witnessed on my television the eccentric woman isn't very eccentric more like quirky and annoying the other someone is the most reasonable mature person in this film but also happens to be just as annoying this films flat out sucks no way around it don't waste your time
the only thing that surprises me more than the number of people who liked this movie is that it was directed by clint eastwood whose work i admire immensely the leads had absolutely no chemistry not for a second could i believe that there was anything deeper than lust between them the story just didn't ring true add to that stilted conversation tons of stereotypes and an incredibly slow plot that basically leads nowhere and you've got yourself a real stinker kay nude scenes might be worthwhile for those seeking some salacious fare but otherwise this is a colossal waste of time my thoughts as i watched the movie was that itwould have been better titled cheesy
this film wasn't programmed in italian have seen it at a manifestation called find it terrible because some scenes seems like music videos chaotic and dark the use of fluorescent colors is ridicule and no suspence in the film music is completely out of the story and i don't have words to describe the visual you look at the first scene the film seems to be interesting but a few minutes later it becomes story is interesting but the development needs a complete review
i'm ask what a are whit the real-tv never i see some in my life is dirty bad and other things but anything more is just a piece of american all time britney saying oh i wanna see his cock i wanna and stuck his and he thinking oh like i gone to still her money just another show of any one more the only good are what britney sell in interior clothes but noting special noting just like i say another show in this sill out the money pure sex all time i just see for i sleep on the before show for this i wanna my money
this movie started out with some semblance of a plot then abandoned it for an endless series of random characters and encounters that have nothing to do with moving the story forward it was impossible to remain engaged with this film this movie is a very cynical pile of garbage made by some people with animation skills but totally lacking in creativity or storytelling ability it is a shockingly bad effort coming from a major studio clearly there are morale and motivation problems at disney not to mention a complete lack of oversight and quality control that management allowed this movie to see the light of day speaks volumes about their incompetence and desperation this movie joins my very short worst movies of all time list
audrey i know you truly cherish your husband memory but please do his legacy justice and heed his wishes dr seuss refused to license his characters during his lifetime for a very good reason we beg of you to please stop cashing in on his stories images fantasies and characters they are getting disemboweled by the powers that be of hollywood and broadway the children of tomorrow will be stuck with these histrionic and grotesque interpretations that will forever pollute the loving warmth and innocence of his is indeed your property to do with as you wish i just wish you would listen to the advice of others for a little while save what is left of dr seuss thank you
robert deniro plays the most unbelievably intelligent illiterate of all time this movie is so wasteful of talent it is truly disgusting the script is unbelievable the dialog is unbelievable jane character is a caricature of herself and not a funny one the movie moves at a pace is photographed in an ill-advised manner and is insufferably preachy it also plugs in every cliche in the book swoozie kurtz is excellent in a supporting role but so annoying is this new imdb rule of requiring ten lines for every review when a movie is this worthless it doesn't require ten lines of text to let other readers know that it is a waste of time and tape avoid this movie
james gandolfini is a good actor so what ever did he take a role in this piece of unfunny rubbish affleck is just a lightweight who just can't cut it the rest of the cast are truly unforgettable i saw this in the usa in an empty theatre i soon knew why the place was empty after about minutes i walked out before the end it was so bad so imagine my surprise when back in england i saw the movie had a glowing report from that yoyo paul ross in one of the down market sundays i always rely on ross to save me money on cinema tickets if he says the movie is good i get straight on this very website to check it out this movie should have gone straight to dvd in a supermarket near you
you wouldn't expect a movie like this to be good and it isn't a no budget ultra violent zombie movie filmed with a bad looking hand-held hilarious the actors obviously have never acted before and it shows in their terrible hilarious readings there is no plot to be seen the little plot i could find seemed to be that a government experiment escaped and a group of zombie seems to be terrorizing a couple families the gore effects are actually some of the most sickening i've ever seen it seems the gore effects people raided a butcher shop for all the body parts and many scenes involve zombies dismembering people and eating their organs a funny and sickening film and about as bad as you can get in terms of any rating mins
boy-girl love with songs only this time the punkette and the straight arrow movie-buffs out there actually like this movie it has fans i must say the mind reels grease is a truly lame enterprise that doesn't even have the courage moxy or sheer gall to take the memory of its predecessor down in flames jaws or exorcist ii no it whimpers along in slow-motion and often just plays dead it looks and feels cheap with a large cast lost amidst messy direction and unfocused handling this was the first time a substantial audience got a glimpse of michelle pfeiffer and although she doesn't embarrass herself a role worth forgetting a misfire on the lowest of levels no stars from
i'm a fan of matthew modine but this i stumbled upon on absolutely witless i see that the screenwriter and director were one and the same so there was no one around to check her worst instincts there are no surprises no original lines and no original characters the goldfish was basically the most sympathetic character what a waste of all this acting talent given how expensive it is to film in new york these days i have to wonder how this got made in the first place and if you're wondering why i watched it at all it came on after a film that i like on cable and i left it on while i worked at the computer not a very demanding picture
kids like these could have been a decent film given the subject matter but instead it has become a below-average run-of-the-mill tv-movie of the week with not much going for it the acting is stale the plot predictable and the direction non-existent for a better movie on the same subject try the excellent le huiti√®me jour a film that really cares about the people with down-syndrome in kids like these they are merely used as an excuse for weepy sentimentality pretty appalling
suffice it to say that this substandard b has nothing to save it not an interesting plot or even one tolerably decent actor josh leonard of blair witch fame does little to help matters do yourself a favor and leave this one on the shelf at your local video store
great western i hear you all say brilliant first effort well i'm not sure what film you all watched but it must have been a different one to the one i saw great westerns or indeed good films of any genre have characters you can believe in and this film had none the acting was poor to say the least and i couldn't care less about any of the characters making the whole film pointless the story was too big for the makers and perhaps they should try their hand at making straight to tv low budget rubbish like you see on those fact or fiction programmes on if you are looking for a good film a great western or even just an enjoyable hour and a half please look elsewhere
somewhere i'd read that this film is supposed to be a comedy after seeing it i'd call it anything but the point of this movie eludes me the dialogue is all extremely superficial and absurd many of the sets seemed to be afterthoughts and despite all the nudity and implied sexual content nothing erotic about this leaving me to wonder just what the heck this thing is about the title premise could have been the basis for a fun politically incorrect comedy instead we're treated to cheap amateurish unfinished sketches and depravity and weirdness for its own sake if i want that i'll go buy a grace jones cd
i picked up this movie for dollars at a discount book store adam sandler is a awesome actor and i figured it would be a good movie well it wasn't there was absolutely no story line at all bad jokes and the other comedian said the f-word every other word he usually dosen't bother me but this was over the top and even worse than the lack of story line was the parts when sandler would just begin talking into the camera at random parts in the movie it reminded me of dora the explorer when they turn and look at the screen and ask you questions and last of all is when they would randomly put in bikini shots of girls at random times in the movie in my opinion don't buy this movie its a waste of money
where oh where to begin in describing the comprehensive wretchedness of neil latest attempt at film making are many kinds of film fans out there but by far the most annoying and shallow is mr intriguing you know mr intriguing don't you the fellow that no matter how stupid lame and incomprehensibly dull a film is he says gee i don't know why everyone hated it i found it intriguing the kind of guy who finds the scent of dog poop intriguing especially when he smears it in the shape of a hitler mustache on his upper lip and marches about the house ranting about the brilliance of science fiction that features thinly veiled references to greek mythology also the guy this version of the wicker man was made for no one else could stand it
just a stilted rip-off of the infinitely better murder she wrote it is absolutely amazing that this poorly-written garbage lasted for a full eight years i'm sure most of the people who watched this unentertaining crap were in their sixties and seventies and just tuned in because they had nothing better to do or simply remembered its star from the old dick van dyke show van dyke who only had a decent career in the never was much of an actor at all his own admission and he was already far too old to play a doctor when the series began in he looks absolutely ancient as a result of years of chain smoking and heavy drinking his talentless real life son barry a wooden actor who has rarely been in anything that didn't involve his father plays his son in the series
really bad why anyone thinks this is a good film let alone funny is a true mystery i like comedies as much as the next man and i loved a christmas story the fact that it has the same director and was based on the same memoirs has me completely puzzled as to why this film is such a complete failure on every level charles grodin is woefully miscast as the father for starters for another it does not seem to have the same pacing it just doesn't flow well everything seems tired and forced the joy of life that permeated the first film is completely absent here you just want the movie to end i wouldn't even recommend this movie for curiosity-seekers who enjoyed a christmas story that bad
i recently bought the dvd forgetting just how much i hated the movie version of a chorus line every change the director attenborough made to the story making the director-cassie relationship so prominent the entire ensemble-premise of the musical sails out the of the musical numbers are sped up and rushed the hit song gets the entire meaning shattered when it is given to overall staging is very only reason i give it a is because a few of the great numbers are still able to be enjoyed despite the attempt to squeeze every bit of joy and spontaneity out of it
this seems like one of those movies that we think we should like but i didn't it seemed to be trying way too hard to be artsy all flash with no content it has some beautiful scenes and any one of them are nice to watch but tack them all together and it becomes an arduous task just to sit through it i rented this because of the glowing reviews on the video carton and the fact that i'm a big shakespeare fan but i was very disappointed i just found it a bit pretentious and at times boring
the week before i saw iowa i saw art school confidential in which a pretentious student makes a film and can't decide whether he wants it to be art or violent exploitation iowa could be the film that he made i can see elements of much better movies in iowa spun and natural born killers however in addition to artiness both those movies had good character development and coherent story lines iowa this movie stumbles to a preposterous end i have to admit that it had consistency this movie is bad from beginning to end and not particularly worse or better in any part the actors all did what they could roseanna arquette deserves better she demonstrates that she is very talented very funny and very sexy but why does she have to demonstrate it in this turd ball
i can't really think of any redeeming features of this utterly bad rendering on asimov than the art direction forget the product placement disaster the unconvincing performance from will smith and the gargantuan plot-holes this wasn't only laughable and but painful to watch even the action was boring a mixture of mtv inspired production values and utterly bad dialogue probably aimed at very small a shame that sci-fi this bad can still be made after we've had bladerunner minority report or to a lesser extent dark city the same director this one really belongs in the bottom list truly awful
as others have pointed out this movie is a load of pretentious drivel for the mindless or all know after seeing trainspotting and acid house that scotland is one of the most depressing places in the first world but unlike trainspotting and acid house without a good dose of humour or gritty realism movies like this do not work and even more importantly without a decent script a movie will not work and there is nothing new inspiring or thought provoking about the script for this fact that this movie won a couple of shows how bad the british film industry is at the moment i thought the aussie movie industry was pretty bad at the moment but unfortunately the british industry is even movie is so bad i wouldn't even bother renting it from the weeklies yourself a favour and give this movie a wide berth
come on what is the deal with this show power rangers anyways i always felt that the show which was originally brought over from japan in a better form took what was great in japan and turned into one of the most ridiculous and pointless excuses in toy merchandising history there is absolutely no point with this show bad haircuts bad costumes earrings etc all show what was ridiculous back in the from the two idiots bulk and skull to the duhs of the main cast jason trini tommy kimberly billy and zack i just want to say one thing give me a brought this from japan and then disney bought the rights to this show around five years the public has to endure reruns of this show on the disney channel and i can say once again is give me a break
i wonder how the actors acted in this movie annette bening was really herself half in and half out was she faking or being natural it didn't make any difference considering that even if she had been walking on the ceiling it would not have changed the pattern of the film brian cox acted really well i almost thought that he had always acted this way tricky dishonest in a dirty surrounding where nobody really cared about hygiene as for gwyneth paltrow the question is what she was doing in this film is quite sickening and disgusting who would pay to see such a crap
rarely has such an amazing cast been wasted so badly griffin dunne rosanna arquette illeana douglas ethan hawke dennis hopper christopher walken and john turturro all jumped on board only to be torpedoed by a script that seems like nothing more than a hollywood in joke attaching martin name to this was probably the draw but the end result is way less than the sum of parts resembling a nightmare gone horribly wrong each scene seems more contrived than the next search and destroy is nothing more than abstract stylish self indulgent nonsense and the entire film is decidedly dull merk
a truly muddled incomprehensible mess most things in the film look more or less like but then there are futuristic things just thrown in like the ray gun and that car the director seemed to be in love with colored lights the only really notable performance was the girl who played valerie but since there was no cast listing i don't know which actress that was this one is worth missing grade f
i mean really either i suddenly lost my sense of humor or this is just a really bad movie stupid ridiculous and just not funny at i saw the preview i knew it wasn't going to be a great movie i just didn't think it was gonna be that happened to the good old times when you could find clever funny lines at any movie when the actors didn't have to play ridiculous roles in attempt to be funny now we find ourselves with movies like this one borat little men scary movie where i could not find the funny skip this piece of for my english
i could never stand watching happy days after chachi joined the cast so i knew i was in trouble when the best scene in this movie featured scott baio skateboard chase scene jodie foster in her first grown-up role turns in her usual professional performance but that is no excuse for this boring mess two hours out of my life that i'll never get back no noteworthy characters unbelievable storyline questionable editing and horrendous cinematography but worst of all i couldn't have cared less the story of california teens in the where the kids live miserable lives and all their parents are idiots don't waste your time watching this ugly excuse for a movie
this has to be one of the most outrageously stupid movies i have ever seen in my entire life just when i think i have seen the stupidest scene in history along comes an even dumber and more bizarre scene i think the transvestite poodles did it for me or better yet her talking perhaps the guy getting the virgin mother statue mounted to a jeep windshield caught in his throat decisions decisions
previous comments encouraged me to check this out when it showed up on tcm but it was a severe disappointment lupe valdez is great but doesn't get enough screen time frank morgan and eugene palette play familiar but promising characters but the script leaves them movie revolves around the ego of lee character who is at best a self-centered physically and verbally abusive jerk the reactions of the public are poorly thought-out and unbelievable making the shenanigans seem like contrivances of a bad writer and it strains credulity that the lupe velez character could fall for stinging one-liners mentioned in another review must be dependent on the observer since i didn't even notice that an attempt was being made
i went to see it in hopes of some good old fashioned alice i realized i would not be getting watched it for a pretty well made movie terms of was aside from it having a good film i had been watching grainy movies all day was nothing good about that killed were tweedle dee and dum played by mudler and can answer that for can answer anything awful about this movie for agree with whoever said it was just one big long inside joke for the all it seemed to so sorry somebody did that to his wonderful tales
i've read some of the other comments and i do have to agree with the ones that didn't get the ending i thought it was going rather the end it kept your mind running and then splat i have not clue what went on the last couple minutes of the movie except a complete mess like they ran out of money to come up with a good ending so they improvised first they had a mysterious thing making people disappear then they had a guy talking about area makes you think about aliens then after they it went to crap i thought the actors and actresses did fine just the script went sour anyways if you do watch this movie be prepared to be disappointed at the end
this is an atrocious movie two demented young women seduce and torture a middle aged man not much to give away in regards to a plot or a spoiler i would only comment that the ending is nearly the most preposterous part of the flick much of the film involves locke and camp cackling obnoxiously all the while grinning psychotically at the camera add to this a soundtrack that repeats again and again including a vaudevillian song about dear old dad that suggests an incestuous quality the viewer never really sees the music is annoying at first then ends up subjecting the viewer to a torture worse than that depicted on the screen the theme here is of youth run amok understandable as a reaction to the but done with little imagination or style avoid it
i heard many stories about this film being great well i took my chance when i saw it for a cheap price at ebay last watched it and i have only a few comments about terrible story-line terrible acting bad never seen any worse movie in my life so far when the storyline is bad than at least make the fights something more interesting but both are done ridiculously the only positive thing about this movie my opinion is nikki berwick god she looks nice in this about it
when i was a kid in the and anything connected with disney was by definition great what happened they are able to get any actors and actresses they want the best of their time but somehow disney manages to screw things up in spite of their abundant can afford the best writers the best producers and directors but screw things up this movie is crap the sad thing is that i suspect disney in their arrogance does not even know when a movie is good or is only due to the talent of the actors that i can even give it a of
worst bob hope comedy that includes some heavy competition hope on an island with sailors dreams aloud of being in a bathtub with a geisha girl steering his ship somebody certainly steered this hope-hackery over the cliff as it features phyllis diller and gina lollobrigida and still can't work up any laughs or excitement bing crosby when you really need him
i first read lorna doone about years ago and absolutely loved it it is a classic historical romance set in the when the west country was several days journey from london and law and order was much harder to enforce sadly this version of the book takes several liberties with the story and was incredibly disappointing in my opinion the acting and production values are ok but the way the story was messed about with was dreadful why do television adaptations do this why would they think that the thousands of fans of a book would want them to change the story one of great mysteries the bbc made an excellent version which was televised at christmas in the early which i am still trying to track down a copy of take my advice read the book and don't bother with this paltry version
movie goers avoid watching this movie if you are faint hearted you might want to commit suicide if you are a short tempered you would want to kill the lead performer of the he does not have any talent in acting he is the mass hero for all the rickshaw rickshaw drivers rowdies thugs and immature and ignorant proves you do not need neither talent nor knowledge to be is the highest paid actor in india that shows the taste of movie going public in india of movie goers in tamil nadu are definitely attracted to his kind of nonsense movies
oh my god this was so bad the story was weak at best and the animation was flat and lifeless even childish this film takes itself far too of course they meant to be funny i saw this last week at the london sci-fi festival and the entire audience was laughing at every scene i think my favourite was shouldn't you be studying medicine at oopsalof and i also think they were trying to see how many times they could cram in the character only line we will be is our destiny i'm sorry but after the first time the words lost all what was with the recommend this as a lesson to americans you cannot animate so please don't try you only embarrass yourselves
and how it made it into production astounds me the main character is an obnoxious show off who isn't the least bit funny i can't stand the character at all a dumb ass with nothing to offer the show is the worst cartoon to surface in the last years no joke the story lines are both poorly written and executed the jokes are as bad as the ones on sweet life of zack and cody i could not dislike this show more terrible and should be canceled even the theme song is bad the title even as though this show is written by a couple of year olds that based the character on themselves and think they're hot stuff when they're really just arrogant and lack creativity as well as test go away far and fast
i don't usually comment but there are things that need to be said where to acting on jeremy part was horrible i didn't think he could be so bad the plot could have been good had it been well directed along with a good solid performance from the lead actor unfortunately this is one of those movies you read about and think it has great potential to be entertaining but get disappointed from the start at least i got good laughs i wouldn't waste my time if i were you
if the only sex you've ever had is with a farm animal then the tag line for this movie is probably still is by far one of the most boring movies i've had the pleasure to try and watch lately i found the dvd lying around at my house and i made the sad mistake of not burning am unable to tell any details without spoiling the movie because there are only about details to this movie just try to imagine someone making a movie about things on c-span only the fictional movie is times less interesting than the most boring debate on think there is a conspiracy somewhere in this movie but i was unable to tell exactly what it was after i gouched my eyeballs out and threw them at richard gere
wow this was a very bad movie as read in other comments this movie has no plot no character development they possibly had some kind of script but difficult to tell based on the actual end editing of this movie was really non-existent it tends to jump from scene to scene without any connection or anything to assist the viewer in determining what is actually in all this is simply a low budget zombie flick that was not thought out at all has bad acting bad dialogue bad only thing that saves this movie from a or is the gore factor i think this must be where they spent whatever money they had to try to justify making you are me dedicated to finding and watching all the zombie flicks you can find do not watch this period
in a movie that follows a struggling actor played evidently by a struggling actor this does no favours for chris klein he struggles to bring anything memorable to the role and meanders on through the shallow script managing to display what could only be described as a bland leading man the story exists but that is all and fails to show any basic start middle and end and the viewer is left shrugging his shoulders feeling as though nothing in the past hour and three quarters has really bright light in the midst of this is fred durst who manages to stand out above his seemingly averagely talented co-stars and does a semi-decent job of bringing the backward character of legde to life whether fred can re-create this when working with a higher calibre of cast remains to be seen but i'l be watching out for him in future
alfred hitchcock invented any kind of thriller you could think set the standards so high that any director who makes a suspense movie will be fatally compared to main subject of this bullock vehicle all the everything was already in classic two students who commit a gratuitous crime the clues that the boys disseminate the master was the first to transfer them to the with an eighty-minute movie which was a technical riveting tour de by numbers does not take place in a single the rope mind what a supreme pits two cops against the evil you would never guess two cops are very plays the part of woman living like a man and her partner is as shy as a clueless two boys performances are not really mind-boggling not as good as say that of edward norton in primal fear know rope was so good
pros summary a female reporter runs into a hitchhiker that tells her stories about the deaths of people that were killed by never in my life have i come across a movie as bad the zombie chronicles filmed on a budget of what looks to be about bucks tzc is a completely horrible horror movie that relies on lame forgetable actors whom couldn't act to save their lives and gore more gross than frightening how does a movie like this even get made simply put avoid tzc like a sexually-transmitted last cents humorously enough this movie was made by a movie company called brain damage films they're brains must have really been damaged to come up with a craptacular movie like rating out of it were up to me this movie would get the rating of negative bajillion
it got switched off before the opening credits had even finished appearing the first joke was just so appallingly lame and dreadfully acted that it had to go you shouldn't really decide to watch this based on my review or not i saw so little of it i shouldn't even really be commenting but suddenly it all became clear why the video shop guy was sniggering at us paying money to see they have just made earnest does dallas
i really looked forward to see planet of the apes but it was a huge settings and masks are great but that is the only good aspect of the film all other things are really annoying mark wahlberg is not acting he is just in the movie looking stupid the other actors are also not very the worst point of all is the story it is absolutely ridiculous for example the apes are lying unconsiousness on the ground but the humans attack them no they wait until they are up again this is just one example for the stupid story but it would take too long to tell them all
kid found as a baby in the garbage and raised at a martial arts academy has a knack for sinking baskets with the help of the man who found him he gets in to college and is promoted to the championship as he searches for his real parents infinitely better in pieces action comedy is a real mess as a whole it seems to be striving for a hipper basketball version of shaolin soccer but the comedy is scatter shot its focus wanders more than a chihuahua with add on quadruple espresso i kept asking what am i watching i watched it from start to finish and i still don't know what the hell happened its a shame since there are some great action scenes some amusing jokes and the occasional moment but nothing none of it ever comes together i'd take a pass
oh my god i bought this movie okay going to be alright i'l know i'll be okay in a month or two some time soon i hope to be rid of the flash backs i was going to eat something after the movie but i just can't seem to get up the courage to try and hold any food down at the moment bad yes bad very bad bad bad bad bad bad wait bad doesn't seem to get the message across in quite the right way hmm there isn't a word to describe just how awful not awful hmm disgustingly horribly now i don't know what to do but throw it out possibly burn it i wouldn't want it to end up at the bottom of an architectural dig a thousand years from now the worst movie ever since hey happy
herculis puaro is in general a well established hero we know well from books and movies this movie or this story don't work and i felt its not mistake the cast isn't good the actors are over exaggerating and making foolish gestures the costumes are so clean and tidy that everything arab clothes look fake and for the serious spectator who thinks twice this movie can be seen as a comedy instead of mystery drama the actor playing herculis puaro is doing a nice job but nothing fantastic the scenes are as said before perfect and looking fake the story is not very enchanting although a mystery of murder but who cares about the death of a loony and vicious blond woman in the iraqi desert the victim is not likable
a problem i have with movies that come on television when there is nothing else to watch i somehow get sucked into really bad this one was fairly watchable the concept of being the only ones left on earth after a comet then finding out zombies are around makes me laugh and why i gave this movie a instead of the story was in that way that makes you laugh stupid think i only watched it because the guy from star trek was the lead i was surprised to see him as a younger he was the only funny character anyway
how good is gwyneth paltrow this is the right movie for her too bad completely out role i haven't read the book by jane austen but i can't believe it is so superficial and the characters aren't much more than caricatures it wasn't probably that easy to reduce in hours of show about pages of the book but i had expected more than just seeing old pieces of furniture and tea cups i was taking a sigh of relief every time i saw an actor who didn't overstep the mark of overacting couple of times
very sad that lucian pintilie does not stop making movies they get worse every time niki and flo is a depressing stab at the camera unfortunate that from the many movies that are made yearly in romania the worst of them get to be sent abroad chicago international film festival this movie without a plot acting or script is a waste of time and money score out of
i watched this movie when joe bob briggs hosted monstervision on tnt even he couldn't make this movie enjoyable the only reason i watched it until the end is because i teach video production and i wanted to make sure my students never made anything this bad but it took all my intestinal fortitude to sit through it though like watching your great grandmother flirting with a year old boy excruciatingly you took the actual film dipped it in paint thinner then watched it it would be more entertaining you see this movie in the bargin bin at s-mart back away from it as if it were a rattlesnake
i am a big movie fan i like movies of all types this is arguably the worst movie i've ever get that it follows the book closely which raises the point that not everything should be made into a movie especially since the authenticity of the experiences in the book have been called into question more than characters are not quirky they are mentally ill the things that happen are not funny they are disturbing especially considering they are supposed to be movie had the feel of the royal tenenbaums another movie i hated only running with scissors was even more dysfunctional and less will never get those hours back i wanted to wash my brain after watching
this italian movie is basically a soap opera with vhs box said it was rated r but the into on the actual tape inside said it was x the latter makes a lot more sense because there is a short scene near the end that was shocking even in the dark you could see dutch actress marishcka detmers performing all sex on this guy and yes you could see his penis in her mouth i read somewhere that this was the first time where a mainline actress had done something like this on parades around in the nude on several scenes but her face was even better than her body she looked beautiful unfortunately the movie is real waste of time and certainly not recommended despite detmers looks
this movie was terrible i thought with all the some what decent actors it would be better don't waste your time eva longoria parker was awful she should stick to desperate housewives paul rudd is becoming a b actor the mess he made in the movie i could never be your woman was the epitome of what i'm saying and lake bell she was cute but definitely in need of some more acting lessons watch just like heaven with reese was a tad better or any other ghost movie you will be grateful to not have wasted your precious time ps i love you is also a good from beyond the grave romance time to start watching movies rated over out of and listen to the people who have already seen it
i could not believe how awful this film was i rarely watch commercial tv but thought well diane keaton is always worth watching i stand corrected everyone involved should be hanging their heads in realize there are not a lot of great roles for women of a certain age but the script to this was so inept clich√©d and baffling that i am surprised it ever got into development or that ms keaton thought she could make a silk purse out of this ear none of the characters had a shred of believability and were so incredibly unlikeable the acting looked like exercises in a beginning class i stared in open-mouthed horror through most of this wondering what were they thinking very very sad that it has come to this don't waste your time
i gave to this film i can't understand how ettore of the greater directors of italian cinema made a film like this so stupid and ridiculous all the stories of the people involved in the movie are and not interesting too boring the only things i save in this movie are giancarlo giannini and vittorio gasmann hope that scola will change radically themes and style in his next film
while channel surfing we found this movie with its promising synopsis we were dismayed at the flat acting and formulaic storyline we found amusing the exploding car scenes unbelievable shoot outs and sets that crash down with the weight of tyro-foam and cardboard what was even more hilarious was seeing all the recycled scenes from peak where the church front falls on the school bus the store fronts break away from the main street the overpass collapsing and the red truck speeding down the alley way as the bricks fall down on it it was a good laugh although unintended and leaves the viewer wondering if it was not originally intended as a low budget spoof of disaster films
to be honest this film is another in a series of huge of these so-called masters of horror films are only horrifying in terms of their sub-par effects and laughable story from ron perlman everyone else in this film cannot act to save their gunshots sounded like someone was playing bop-it under the boom mike or something and looked completely this film is about as scary as home only good masters are cigarette burns jennifer and maybe don't know how these directors can sleep at night knowing that they have ruined the very genre that some of them used to actually understand
a christmas story is a holiday classic and my favorite movie so naturally i was elated when this movie came out in i saw it opening day and was prepared to enjoy myself i came away revolted and digusted the anticipation that rang true in a christmas story is curiously missing from this mess a red ryder bb gun is better to get than a chinese it is not very funny at all charles grodin is good but the buck stops there bottom star don't even bother
really everybody in this movie looks like they want to be someplace else no wonder the casting is done not with the left hand but rather not at all i haven't seen anything worse than natascha mcelhone impersonating some sort of agent carrying a gun you don't use a spoiled city-brat-look in such a role the only worse thing i can imagine is casting doris day as a prostitute the rest of the cast is likewise awful possibly with hurt as the sole exception sometimes you can see him trying but suffering oh did i mention that it is a completely insane story jeopardizing many peoples lives because you are divorced and want to see your family well it must be because the guy is because the photography could be worse
well basically the movie blows blair witch meets sean ill conceived fantasy about going to iraq to show the world what the war on terror is really about the script sounds like it was written by grader offense to graders the two main actors over-act the entire film they used the wrong kind of camera and the wrong type of that i know anything about those it just didn't look like real documentaries i've watched and worst of all christian johnson took a great idea and made it suck it reminded me of the time i tried to draw a picture of my dog and ended up with a really bad stick figure looking thing that looked more like a giant turd i'd rather watch the blair witch viii than sit through that again
i spent almost two hours watching a movie that i thought with all the good actors in it would be worth watching i couldn't believe it when the movie ended and i had absolutely no idea what had was mad because i could have used that time doing something tried to figure it all out but really had no clue thanks to those who figured it out and have explained or wrong better than not knowing anything who was the lady in the movie with dark hair that we saw a couple of times driving away how did first lady know that her husband was cheating on her at the end of the movie kate said she would eventually find out the truth does this mean that we're going to be subjected to end game
this is a dry and sterile feature filming on one of most interesting events in wwii and in history of warfare behind the front line bad drama composition is worst about this film as plot on killing hitler suppose to be pretty dramatic event there is no character development at all and idea that tom cruise suppose to play a high rank commander that questions his deepest inner thoughts on patriotism and treason is completely insane i believe that mister bin would play it better generally speaking film pretty much looks as a cheep copy of good german tv movie stauffenberg from but can't get close to that film regarding any movie aspect whatsoever however movie obviously gets its financial goal with pop-corn audience that cherishes hollywood fast-mood blood and shallow art values
i cant help it but i seem to like films that are meant to be scary and are just plain bad i have personally listed it in my own top worst movies right under creatures of the abyss watch this film and have a laugh just don't expect to see any academy awards for acting more chance of understanding the film its self in all honesty though i have seen much worse than this plus some maniac cruising round the desert wiping the same people out that just died is that unbelievable that its got to be original i think its one of those love or hate movies you can make up your own mind yes its awful but it pulls it off somehow thats why i love it
i really wish i could give this a negative vote because i think i just wasted minutes of my life watching the worst horror movie ever put to film the acting was just god awful i mean realllyyyy bad the dialog was worse the script sounded like it was written by i can't think of anything horrible enough to say and the day outside and the night inside shots make you think the events took over several days terribly acted directed written etc etc all the way down to the gofer how gets lunch for everyone stay away from this one at all costs if my only saving grace to stay out of hell is by doing one good deed it is to tell the world to not watch this crap this movie is the exact reason why horror movies are never taken seriously
this film differentiates itself from the run-of-the-mill wonder of the human body documentaries by bravely if bizarrely opting to elicit disgust in the viewer in one scene the camera closes in on a gigantic zit as a teenager squeezes pus and fluid out of it in another the camera is semisubmerged in a swamp of half digested food and stomach acid as parts of a pasta salad drop in from the esophagus and plop into the goo in a final tour de force the camera takes the viewer on a harrowing ride through a forest armpit hair unfortunately i'm not making any of this up see this film if you must but bring your vomit bag and don't have pasta salad beforehand
i saw this movie in the theater when i was a kid and always remember it as my first experience with getting ripped off by a horrible movie with a good commercial the commercial was great but it i found out later that it had every explosion or special effect in the entire movie and even some that weren't in the movie there was some sort of plot relating to the aliens but the aliens were never actually shown in the movie as far as i remember it was clearly a case of someone making a buck off a cheap movie designed to scam people i guess my world of innocence ended that day when i found out there were bad people out there who make bad bad movies
i watched this on a weekend afternoon as there was simply nothing else on it would have been more entertaining to chew off my feet and probably less painful i urge anyone to watch this just to see how turgidly awful a movie can be surely it was deliberate i cringed at every futile attempt at humour carried out in such a childish unrehearsed badly executed way that it was beyond belief this is the movie that makes spiceworld look like goodfellas think i am exaggerating well give it airtime and think again dreadful utterly dreadful if this wasn't a prank then the director and anyone else responsible for this should be removed and promptly shot after being forced to watch this film again
there are no spoilers in this review because everything was already shown in the trailer i am trying to be balanced in my review because i strongly support local movies but i can't help but support the backlash against this movie it is slow boring and bordering on pointless even the almost nice and believable moments were immediately undercut by painful clich√©s and bad acting vernetta lopez and wong li lin whom i usually love were only passable in this movie it felt like the director was trying to make a melodramatic tv soap then got carried away and decided to put it on the big screen the leap years should come with an ra rating awful but it hasn't changed my faith in local movies more good films will come so long as more films like these don't get made
this really was the worst movie i have ever seen michael vartan is hot but who is this woman and she looks absolutely awful through the whole movie the hair is so bad they talk in like monotone voices and there is nooo chemistry the cover of the dvd does not even remotely come close to what the movie actually is really really boring i had to fast forward through some of it because it was so painful to watch i really want to know how i on earth anyone could think this is good hhaha they literally just like talk and say yeah and there is no passion whatsoever i could not tell at all that they were in love i'm sorry but this was the saddest excuse for a movie i think i have ever seen
this is the crappiest film i have ever seen but in all fairness watchable and rather funny i don't think the film-makers intended it to be your typical hollywood blockbuster quality just a stupid film about a serial killer who gets doused in a load of toxic waste causing a reaction with him and the snow the middle of winter he then turns into a killer snowman which is enough to to make you laugh on own this film is really stupid but funny the killings are wouldn't advise you to go and buy it i did cover looked if it happens to be on tv one night and you're up for a laugh then stick it on
the killings in this movie isn't that bad but for sure the movie is even worse than that not even worth the wear it might cause when you slide it into your even the wear it causes on your shoulders carrying it from the dvd-store not to speak of the money and time you spend renting and watching it beyond understanding how anyone could say anything positive about this movie it was just a bare masochistic tendency of mine that caused me not to stop watching add to that the group pressure from my manuscript is awful the directing even worse and the acting is plain hope you don't see this as a spoiling your fun i'd rather see it as a fair warning do not waste your time watching this garbage
think of this film as a saturday morning live-action program from ages ago even the small tykes will find this one hard to please because it runs like molasses i can't fully understand how god awful it is to make something too typical and uninteresting especially in the costume department too many warrior-wizard movies out there have used the same old plotline numerous times over but this is mighty scarce considering its appeal to the little darlings and who in the world would've let a topless mermaid be cast in the first place i thought this was a family movie another fine gem for your tv season
what a horrible horrible film the worst collection of cliches i have seen in a long time not that i saw much i left the theatre screaming after about minutes in search of a stiff drink to soothe my nerves meryl streep was awful as usual how many hurt and tortured expressions can person have aidan talents were as so often totally wasted and who told gloria estefan she could act trying to be polically correct this movie still enforces racial stereotypes inexperienced lonely music teacher teaches underprivilegded kids violin in poor neighbourhood school the kids weren't even cute just written in to suit the appalling script aaargh wes craven really made me cringe for once real horror this one
i consider stuart bliss the worst movie i have ever acting was terrible and the plot ludicrous i get the fact that the main wife leaving him triggered a mental breakdown but it got so silly and boring after a while i could have cared less about any of the movie kept going over and over the same ideas without anything fresh or surprising to add to the plot the whole thing with the geiger counter got too much after a while after stuart started opening up his wall to see what was behind it after the counter indicated something was there was the repetitive scenes with the flyer and the confusing ones where he meets should have guessed that this movie was a flop when i didn't recognize any of the actors do yourself a favor when this movie comes up read a book you'll be better off
anyone who thinks this film has not been appreciated for its comic genius must have been smoking with the two stoners in the film this film is not is a bad movie should be no comparisons between this film and the naked gun or airplane since the latter two films are well written and funny class reunion is neither of those things the sad thing is it had such potential cast good story lines but the good jokes are few and far between the scenes that were supposed to be funny came off more annoying than amusing the stoner guys the vampire the blind funny the only funny character were delores one who sold her soul to the lampoon has made some really good films house vacation but this isn't one of them i certainly expected more from john hughes
this movie is extremely boring it tells a story of a female gas station owner and her life nothing exciting ever happens the director has really kept it real and it feels just like a camera following a woman around as she lives her life i had to watch other films by this director for a class the others were not as boring this film was also watched for an better be worth the boringness with a good grade overall unless required don't watch the film but don't discount other films by this director because they're not as don't discount other films about africa they're usually good especially when done by a western director
there is no reason to see this movie a good plot idea is handled very badly in the middle of the movie everything changes and from there on nothing makes much sense the reason for the killings are not made clear the acting is awful nick stahl obviously needs a better director he was excellent in in the bedroom but here he is terrible amber benson from buffy has to change her character someday even those of you who enjoy gratuitous sex and violence will be disappointed even though the movie was minutes which is too short for a good movie too long for this are no deleted scenes in the dvd which means they never bothered to fill in the missing parts to the spend the time on this one
steven could you be a part of such an awful film i rented this movie because your movies usually have been pretty clean i have lost a lot of respect for you being in an awful movie such as this one very very poor taste i am embarrassed that i even rented this movie steven if you keep acting in movies like this one i believe that your career is over my husband and i have enjoyed watching many of your movies because you always can get the bad guy with a few hand maneuvers and make it also the language is pretty clean in your this one is something else i will think twice before i rent another movie of yours
this film is beautiful to look at but is like watching really bad experimental theater the plot there was one doesn't make any sense but it is very artistic lots of shots of half-dressed actors wrestling and looking deep into each eyes lots of arty shots through windows and with people out of frame mumbling and people wandering wistfully lingering close-ups of faces and bodies by the time you get to the threesome on the roof with the cat you'll be ready to throw a bottle of ky at the is supposed to be about a father and relationship but you will just be wishing the two of them would just each other and get it over with if you have always wanted to see bad russian gay porn without any money shots your wish has been granted
i saw this movie a couple years back i could'nt sleep and there was nothing on so i peeped it what really gets me is it makes no sense and thats why its disturbing richard gets tied up in chicken wire and jarvis starts making out with girl while unconscious then buddy troubador is playing some stupid song on his guitar by the next morning it shows girl talking to jarvis and trouby and then she walks back to richard and looks at him while still tied up then they play some happy music and the movie is finished i mean what happened did they brake up and what was she saying to those and jarvis its to puzzling and to poor to i can't stand movies that are disturbing and don't make sense this was the worst film i've ever seen since the version of lord of the flies
sergio leone spins in his grave if there was any film that tramples upon a life work its this one the lead lone wolf bravado is uninspiring and lame and the script was apparently written by a monkey with an eight grade education idea this was should be horse whipped the only reason i'm spending time trashing it is because a line minimum sergio family should sue not because its crap but because now immortalized as crap by mst shame disgust i blame least gary busey makes crap that wont offend anyone but cocaine users and weapon film is pure blasphemy
hello boys and girls this isn't your regular movie review because this is going to be the cold hard truth are you serious this movie sucked so many balls i couldn't keep them out of my mouth they might as well have sprayed me in the eye with monkey semen you'd need one seriously large douche to pump out all the vaginal fluid from this plot was very lacking the actors were terrible i rewound the dance number several times and had to pause it even more because i was choking on my own spit do boys
i don't know who wrote the script for this movie but from the first moment on i was irritated of all possible decisions they could make up in the mountains why do they make the decision which is the most dangerous of all why do the criminals act dumb although they managed to get a huge amount of money out of a bank and get away with it why doesn't the main criminal land the helicopter shoot stallone grab the money and fly away with the chick as a hostage and there are more cases of illogical behavior i'd give this movie points for nice action and great landscape scenery but due to the illogical behavior of the characters i just can give this movie point
i wondered why john wood was not playing dr falken until i watched the film bad plot bad science bad acting and overall a bad film please don't watch this film rent the original war games if you are feeling didn't like the bending of the plot to beat-the-terrorist-threat idea either in the first film was built because russia had of warheads pointed at the in this film the idea behind the computer was to kill terrorist in training before they are a threat politics aside one of the good thing about the first film was the highlighting that even a stupid computer could grasp the idea of the pointlessness of war in the end no such insight is offered in this film
for the life of me i cannot get why they would want to make a movie about the jerry springer show so incrediably trashy some ways sadly a guilty pleasure we all have to admit that we've seen at least one episode part of our pop culture i saw this on usa recently pretty bad i will admit that jerry does a horrible job of what i think he meant as acting or something like it jamie pressley is in it playing herself basically all she needed was her lover boy kid rock it would've been perfect then so i would recommend skipping ringmaster just watch the jerry springer show more enjoyable than
think of the ending of the grudge with the following a man who repeatedly says the word sunshine a cowboy a love story sarah michelle gellar cutting herself and a creepy and underwater sea a good movie i seriously did not enjoy it whatsoever the poster for the movie is extremely misleading as well and i found that it was just to suck people into watching can't believe i went your time and watch saw film where the writing makes you feel like there was effort put into mike and im out
as usual i went to watch this movie for otherwise the film is no good rajni wanted to end his movie career with this film is it would be successful but fortunately or unfortunately the film was a failure after this he delivered a hit with chandramukhi i am eagerly waiting for his forth coming have read the other comment on rajni i found it interesting as the user is from tn too rajni is one actor who acts i think from his heart not from his mind he is not a method actor like kamal hasan i think we need to appreciate rajni for his strong going at his ways i need to fill lines for this comment so wish u good luck rajni
with their no holds bar cruel offensive humor sure enough to offended anyone you would sure think this would be a laugh riot wrong worest movie since open water don't be to surprised if you completely miss this movie upon release date as i'm sure it wont do very good at all at the box office this movie had a lot of potential but fell to little to short no enough character development awkward actors and the upside of this movie was nudity boobs amazing if i had to see this movie again i myself would go postal
i wasn't expecting this to be a great movie but neither was i expecting it to be so awful i hated the mother character so much i had to turn the channel i turned it back hoping it was just one part of the movie but no and for the daughter to sit there take being embarrassed or almost done out of a job or driven to madness inside her own home are you kidding me i was raised to respect even fear my mother but i'd put her up fast in the nearest hotel if she proved that annoying in my house i was expected to follow a set of rules in my house after didn't buy any of it i tried giving it several chances i really did sorry
tim robbins and john cusack are two actors i have appreciated throughout their careers and that was the only reason for choosing to watch this movie well all i can say is i totally regretted it these two great actors humiliate themselves all the way through by performing a number of irrelevant unimaginative and kitch to the extreme that this is bad on its that are supposed to make people laugh but fail to do so the only reason i can think is that the director was their friend and they decided to support his movie by starring in it-i can't think of anything else because this movie is so cheap fortunately tim robbins and john cusack haven't disappointed me ever since i would recommend you to avoid this film unless you want your opinion about the two actors spoiled
dire just dire the script is contrived the acting painful and the story just drags along it is without a doubt a celebration of sally potter and little else this wouldn't be so bad but the director writer and star of the film and so is just self-glorification i found myself not caring about the developing romance between the principal two characters and the ending came not a moment too soon it has two redeeming features first is that a lot of the shots are really quite lovely particularly in paris and look rather good in black and white secondly whether you're a fan of tango or not the music is by and large excellent where sally starts singing watch this film at your own risk or if you need an unintentional laugh i am sure it appeals to someone statistically it has to
on steve show hillarious he doesn't even try to be funny and he just is but his movie wasn't even what i would call a movie-i mean when that guy on his car is trying to kill him just saying oh this is one nasty bloke and looking straight into the camera he put his face in the camera too much and then when the guy falls off the car wouldn't you expect him to be dead and terri had the worst acting i'd ever seen like when the crocodile almost ate steve she just says steve she didn't sound scared or anything it was just steve i mean i hate to sound mean but that was not worth seeing i love steve irwin but his movie was just too stupid
all the world said that the film tashan would be a good movie with great pleasure but this is not the case vijay krishna acharya made a serious mistake to take as an actress kareena kapoor she was unbearable throughout the film her tom-boy look does not really goes well even the film the story of the film is not making sense at all everyone said that the quetin taratino of india is vijay but its not at all quetin the talent anil kapoor was involved in this stupid movie anil is an actor of large caliber and this film is not akshay kumar has also been a victim of this film as all is saif the style and the phoormola is not really good in this film i was disappointed
un-bleeping-believable meg ryan doesn't even look her usual pert lovable self in this which normally makes me forgive her shallow ticky acting schtick hard to believe she was the producer on this dog plus kevin kline what kind of suicide trip has his career been on whoosh banzai finally this was directed by the guy who did big chill must be a replay of jonestown hollywood style wooofff
if you are a fan of really bad movies and you think there funny you will the great acting of shaq first off putting pro players in movies hardly ever works shaq had to of been the worst actor i have ever seen next to dennis rodman who also made a few bad movies well any way this movie is also bad due to the hideous kid i would give this a zero but that is impossible
when my own child is begging me to leave the opening show of this film i know it is bad i wanted to claw my eyes out i wanted to reach through the screen and slap mike myers for sacrificing the last shred of dignity he had this is one of the few films in my life i have watched and immediately wished to unwatch if only it were possible the other films being troll and fast and furious both which are better than this crap in the may drink myself to sleep tonight in a vain attempt to forget i ever witnessed this blasphemy on the good seuss mike myers i say stick with austin or even resurrect waynes world just because it worked for jim carrey doesn't mean seuss is a success for all
i suppose if you like endless dialogue that doesn't forward the story and flashy camera effects like the scene transitions in the television show you'll enjoy the film me all i wanted was a nice tight little story and it wasn't there the pacing was practically backward plot points were buried under a sea of unneeded dialogue and there was absolutely no sense of dread or tension or it the redneck is it the wendigo no a cameraman on speed not scary it doesn't generate a single note of tension or atmosphere unless you're scared by mtv like those reviewers before me i too noticed that by the end the movie invokes derisive laughter from the film
this may have been made for the hell of it but it was most probably the worst film i've seen in years the best thing about the entire dvd would be the case i'm surprised that people took the time to make something so rubbish and yet spend money on it too i'm glad i only rented i suppose the real fans of this film would probably have to be sadistic and gothic to care about it without taking in any cgi or any other effects for that matter i hope alex chandon learnt a lesson about lighting and sfx to make a better film in the future that is if he is still in to buyers this is extremely disappointing don't buy it
this collection really rented it thinking really would enjoy some good fighting man this sucked quick flashy cuts an extremely annoying speaker and the fights them selves were heavily edited and shortened thinking especially of jet fight in fists of legend and jackie fight from drunken master the deal with those brawling streetfighters so cool about that seen more interesting fights on martial a stupid collection of cuts for stupid not ever buy this film do not encourage the people who made this crap to make more of this go buy the movies the fights were from and wath the fights in their uncut glory
first i bought it at the video store second i watched it third it was boring fourth it was not funny fifth most of the antics were lame and last but not least not only a bad movie a total am a huge adam sandler fan despite this disappointing and forgotten film i pity it because it was his first movie even if you are a huge adam sandler fan don't bother watching this movie instead just take the video board a yacht and throw it overboard
i love the munna bhai mbbs but lagge raho sux really sux i have never seen such a boring movie in my whole life and these high ratings really astonished me that wat happened to the taste of indian cinema viewers be educated girl needs an advice from a bhai people discussing their personal prob on phones come on man from which part of the world u r i agree that films should be fictitious but these things are really out of stars is for mins good starting
words cannot describe how utterly abysmal this movie is it is a series of random unfunny clips about everything from a stupid batman spoof to a guy getting it on with an old dead lady disturbing the only remotely amusing thing about the underground comedy movie is watching joey buttafuoco the best actor in this movie also it is rated shunning away the only people that might tolerate it
i've never really considered myself much of student when it comes to watching films i watch them form an opinion and it but unhinged changed all this this film is without a doubt the most inept attempt at film making i've ever seen every kid who rocks up at university thinking they're gonna be the next spielberg or tarantino needs to be handed this film with a handbook titled how not to make a film not only is there no story to be had the film makers weren't even competent enough to make a film worth watching been a while since i saw it but all i can say is watch the overhead tracking shots in the opening scenes they are never ending almost like having your teeth pulled only not as much fun
this film is awful not offensive but extremely predictable the movie follows the life of a small town family in the the father the principal at the school is going through a mid-life crisis enter a pretty teacher from the big city who starts challenging her students minds with some thought-provoking stuff like think for yourself the principal doesn't agree with her teaching but she is pretty you can connect the dots his teenage daughter ryder wannabe tara frederick is fed up with the small town lifestyle and wants to live she gets some bad advice hangs out with some bad boys and apparently family planning wasn't being taught at her school shocking seeing that director paul shapiro has mainly worked in tv this movie plays like a more adult version of an after-school special or a very special episode of one of the more mundane sitcoms
i went into this movie hoping for the best i like wartime musicals in general dick powell and lucille ball did good jobs with their roles however the writers gave them boring dialog the love-interest between the two of them was not given any real growth just suddenly it was there i did not think much of the music the best number was the snippet we heard of spike jones with der face the one complete number that spike jones did had little of his great musical comedy pretty tame with the monkey bert comedy skits were were parts to enjoy lucille ball was quite a looker and there was a good selection of bit players who really deserved more time on screen
i am ashamed to have this movie in my collection the most redeeming factor to owning the dvd is the short film in the bonus features my vote for this movie is a big fat zero don't misunderstand i'm a horror girl but i want some meat behind the story not to mention i prefer the evil to happen to humans not to be tricked in to watching what seemed like forever clips of animal snuff acts of brutality interrupt achingly long silence and poor acting if i was forced to make a comparison to another film the only one that comes to mind is cannibal holocaust bad boring pointless and a wholly uncomfortable watch
go immediately and rent this movie it will be be on a bottom shelf in your local video store and will be covered in dust no one will have touched it in years it may even be a special worth ten bucks i swear buy it there aren't very many films than can compare with this the celluloid version of that goo that forms at the bottom of a trash can after a few years yes i gave it a but it really deserves much lower scales were not designed with stuff like this in mind
painful to watch and not entirely for empathy with the struggles of the characters two of the main characters cynthia the mother and monica the acknowledged daughter spend the great bulk of the film pathetically mewling and bitterly bitching respectively their characters are so firmly established that their redemption into tolerable personalities after a quick family catharsis is unbelievable it wasn't worth the wait i wish a worthy pitch for honesty among families was less of a headache to view
this movie i don't know why they would take such an indellible character as pippi longstocking and cast the singularly charmless tami erin i will never know why they would spend money on art direction and some not-all-that-bad special effects then not bother to edit it properly i will never know why the sets and costumes are sometimes in period and sometimes bizarrely not why they commissioned such bad songs why the script doesn't make any sense whatsoever even on a silly film level what were they thinking nothing about this movie is quite as it should be every single part is dubbed always poorly every sound effect is slightly wrong every edit is in the wrong place every performance is bad in some way it does manage to create an appropriate atmosphere despite all the problems but it never captures the magic that is astrid creation
i personally found this movie to be terrible first it was hardly objective and provided one side of the debate the only people who were presented as the side saying he did exist being a bunch of people coming from a billy grahm revival secondly it deviated heavily from its supposed topic did jesus exist to talking about how violent christianity is and showing scenes from mel gibsons the passion in the end it has the director con his former principal of a conservative private school into being interviewed and attempts to trap him about teaching the kids there faith oh and also the techno music just made the film harder to watch
would someone tell shaq to stick to what he is good at basketball this movie was not even entertaining on a stupid level in this movie shaq plays a genie who lives in a boom box is that not orginal a genie in a boom box instead of a lamp he is supposed to help a little boy played by the equally annoying francais cappra this movie had the most flimsy storyline since water world the acting was awful and i think that anyone who likes this flim would be afraid to admit it
i didn't expect much when i saw this at the palm springs film fest this weekend it was an alternate choice when two other films were sold out still i held out hope it sounded a bit much like bride and prejudice guy falls for an indian beauty parental conflict blah blah blah was not perfect but it was an enjoyable film with some good laughs and likable bollywood bride had none of that the acting seemed stilted and way to by-the-numbers characters were so clich√© the story seemed like it could have been written by high school freshman drama student technically the sound really bothered me it seemed as if there was a lot of over-dubbing of dialogue i mean a lot i know sometimes necessary but it sounded like half the film was shot in a closet and it became very stars is being somewhat generous
i read comments about this being the best chinese movie ever perhaps if the only chinese movies you've seen contained no dialogue long drawn-out far-away stares and silences and hack editing then you're spot story-line hardly try juvenile and amateurish exquisite moods and haunting memories hardly try flat-out boring and was awful i could not wait for it to be over particularly when the best lines in the movie consist of how are you i'm fine are you sure yes wow what depth of character i guess the incessant cigarette smoking was supposed to speak for a huge fan of many chinese japanese and korean films i was totally disappointed in this even sentimentally sappy the road home was better than this
this movie was didn't develop any of the characters at all and the storyline was played out horribly it was a definite sleeper you'd expect the action scenes on a movie like this to be its strong points but d-wars surprises you with even a let down in that department the acting was just a step above the level of a low budget porno flick and i seriously mean was actually happy to see the end credits on this one cause it was just that bad please whatever you do people don't waste your time and money on a crappy movie like d-wars
this is the worst movie ever made the acting the script the location everything i would have given it a little chance if there were attractive women in the movie but even they were bad you would think that a movie with the word beach in title would have good-looking women in it wouldn't you
this series had potential but i suppose the budget wouldn't allow it to see that potential an interesting setup not dissimilar to lost it falls flat after the episode the whole series episodes could have made a compelling minute film but the makers chose to drag it on and on many of the scenes were unbearably slow and long without moving the action forward the music was very annoying and did not work overall there were few characters we cared about as their characters did not grow during the time well one grew a bit the ending was as terrible as the rest of series the only kudos here is to the art dept and set dressers they created an interesting look too bad the writer and director lacked the foresight to do something interesting with that element
i am a dumber person for renting the dvd redline chicago pictures who made this stupid movie never paid palisades media group to buy web ads on various automotive sites including mine which has an alexa rating of they ripped me off on the deal and now i am out and they wasted much of my personal time rapport of palisades media you know who you don't rent or buy this movie it sucks and the people behind it are ripoff has a cast of losers and poor movie is a joke
adrianne should really get a life-without mr brady she nauseates me and has been one of the main reasons why i know longer tune in to the show pretty brainless show and every little argument or disagreement seems to be put under the scope and analyzed to death this makes them they are anything but ready for marriage and yet i know these disagreements are all part of life i guess to some people this is entertainment if this happens to fall into next season i will feel sorry for anyone who has nothing better to do with their life but watch this trash though i would not be terribly surprised can't even stand the commercials for this show anymore i hope they're getting enough money to constantly embarrass themselves in front of a camera week after week however the a girl has one heck of great butt
this movie is not funny it just takes the nerd stereotypes and amplifies them all the main characters make less than a year they all live with their parents they're all socially retarded and they have no luck with women the jokes are horrible and unimaginative such as two of the gamers getting beat up by a black midget because one of them had a kkk looking hood on was his wizard costume and the other guy had on a john rocker warm up how funny a nerd so he doesn't know about sports you may have to be a childish high-schooler to find any of this stuff funny poorly done mockmuntaries are so painful to watch but obviously extremely cheap to make i feel sorry for kelly lebrock and beverly d'angelo i guess these are the only opportunities available for hotties way past their prime
from the nepotism capitol of the world comes another junk flick in a fancy wrapper cq tells a lame disjointed mess of a story which is little more than a bunch of silly caricatures a babe and straight man davies running around trying to make a stupid sci-fi flick i can't think of any reason anyone would want to spend time with this ridiculous attempt at film making
wouldn't it be great if not another teen movie actually put an end to all of these stupid pointless i'm getting more sex than you are teen movies in a perfect world yes yet this one is even worse this one is not humiliating for the stars humiliating for the distributor all of the jokes are basically college students exposing stuff that people probably have no interest in seeing yet funny devon sawa who was actually good in final destination is just plain dull in this movie it makes you wonder if being bad on purpose grade f
the worst kind of film basically the us declaration of independence was replaced with a plasma screen and this fooled the security for several days plasma screen that would theoretically run for less than seconds off that watch battery assuming it had a low enough internal resistance to deliver the required current which it would be possible with a dozen large car batteries and an inverter but that system wouldn't fit into the case sorry to be anal but this isn't even close to being plausible the rest of the film wasn't a great deal better and i'm left wondering why the budget couldn't have been donated to charity or me
i just didn't get this it a musical there were choreographed songs and dancing in it a serious the acting was not good enough for whoopi goldberg a quality serious had difficulty staying awake through this disjointed movie the message on apartheid and the tribute to the students who died during a student uprosing is noted but as entertainment this was very poor and as a documentary style movie it was for yourself but in fairness i hated it
i expected to enjoy a romantic comedy featuring hip hop but was disappointed on many levels first of all the story is so badly recycled as to make it almost unbearable second the setting acting and story are not very authentic or believable third there are a lot more good black actors to choose from than these standard picks how about some originality third there were very few hip hop songs played in entirity if any none seemd really central overall film was a great disappointment but the editing style was very interesting and almost made the film worthwhile
supposedly based on the life of domino harvey a model turned bounty hunter i'd say is fabricated i always keep an open mind when it comes to movies however this movie lost its chances when it became apparent it had narration throughout the film something i can't stand and to top it off the heroine of the story is so hateful and depicted as an arrogant i just wanted it to end with her being shot in the head too incoherent too flashy and way too boring a who gives a crap kinda story and i really think that big time directors need to make movies based on their own or a own imagination not something based on some ignorant snobby life
this movie is nothing but a religious tract promoting classic hinduism and new age occultism dressed up with western images to be swallowed by those who are ignorant of foundational religious comparisons basic tenants of hinduism contain elements of reincarnation of the characters appear both in the present time and also in the obviously reincarnated god is an impersonal force animal life and plant life are all the same is pantheism redfield has tried to mix eastern mysticism with western christianty his attempt at syncretism may fool or confuse those who are not seekers of truth but this movie is a feeble excuse for any ultimate reality as the ad in the old berkeley barb used to say for will show you how to start your own religion as one famous prophet has said use the force luke
designed only to annoy amuse any self-respecting intelligent person if the intention had been for the viewer to dislike the title character then it would have been okay but i know that there is no such thing as a hollywood director who'd make a critique of pro-marxist movement especially not a filmmaker from the there is so much idiotic dialog going on here that sometimes i wondered if i wasn't actually watching a comedy you wouldn't be at fault for thinking that this is a satire how na√Øve the movie appears spacek has been in her share of leftist movies which brings me to the obvious inescapable conclusion that the redhead hick is one of those hollywood liberal morons but i mean aren't they all nice boobs but for brains
this is the worst movie i have ever seen and i have seen quite a few movies it is passed off as an art film but it is really a piece of trash one redeeming quality is the beautiful tango dancing but that cannot make up for sally disgustingly obvious tribute to herself the plot of this movie is nonexistent and i guarantee you will start laughing by the end especially where she starts singing absolutely unreal
i'll say it again this movie was totally lame kids will like it sure but the whole thing was basically a rehash of the original which is to be expected since they pretty much explored the whole concept in the first movie but still did they have to completely rehash the entire movie i mean everything is re-done from the little mermaid the worst part of it is morgana crazy sister who appears out of nowhere and threatens melody which is ridiculous since triton is there with his magic trident why didn't triton do anything about it because the plot required him to do nothing i could go on but i won't the whole thing is a shameless attempt to rake in more money from the little mermaid and was obviously thrown together without any thought because they knew it would sell overall it is a terrible waste of time
this film is horrible bad acting bad writing bad music just horrible not only is it incredibly misrepresentative of role-playing games but the key elements of the film are poorly executed may the god i don't believe in have mercy on the souls of the miserable wretches who conceived and gave birth to this abomination
want to know the secret to making a slasher film set at a fitness center work just pad the film out with lovely ladies in super tight workout outfits and have them bump and grind the floor like they are at a club what the makers of this horrid slasher film did and that little gimmick kept me watching till the bitter end this is the worst slasher film i have ever seen but every time i was ready to switch the channel they'd add another scene with the workout girls and i'd stay put as a slasher film killer workout fails in every category i can think of as a showcase for beautiful girls working out it is a success strong recommendation to avoid unless the thought of half the film being a big show appeals to you
i found the pace to be glacial and the original story blown way out of proportion to the content my wife slept through most of it and i did not try to wake her because i felt she was not missing holmes and watson enter the house and then are potentially caught it is unclear how they could hide all of their entry and burglary tools so quickly it is also unclear how the door to the study is locked preventing the servants from getting thing that puzzled me was right at the end when there was a glint in the eye of the broken statute i have no clue what this was supposed to represent
if there was a zero rating i would give it to this movie today was the second time i tried to watch it and i still couldn't make it through from beginning to end i can't believe the multiple stars given by others can only assume they either know the actors or are a publicist in disguise the acting is atrocious all around the script is blah the kid playing nichole shows zero emotion even when being threatened the southern accent from the actress playing mom is laughable i'm from georgia and have friends from texas believe me nobody talks like that none of her emotions seemed real in any scene the subject matter is very serious and deserves much better treatment
do not waste your time watching this unless you want to study it for all the wrong things you shouldn't do to make a good film i am not one to usually review a movie but this one is personal i wasted precious time which they cannot give back i feel compelled to write this report to warn others not to waste their time watching this crap if this was a student project i would have to say not bad but only for the first min after that it gets annoying the screaming the bad audio the bad video good camera man could have made it much better and yes whats with the blair-witch effect no budget i was hoping it was going to get better but it doesn't now how the hell did it deserves a is more fair but for wasting my time i have said my peace
if you like to comment on films where the script arrive halfway the movie then this is the one a setting and acting as in a porn movie but nothing is happening only some groping and touching of the third kind which actually becomes very boring after minutes of touchy feely but no action a few of the actors i've seen in real x rated movies and there their acting then was a lot better all the special effects are done by the great rondo whom performs all the magic whit his mind a cult movie is written on the box does that mean that this film is not to be watched at drunk with some friends and watch this movie on new years eve ore thanks giving
very bad acting and a very shallow story not even a decent that were suposed to be shocking like humans geting on board an alien ship were boring and very is one of the worst sci-fi i've ever seen i saw the stars and decided to watch it since i like the genre but it sucked so really very few good movies on alien subject i think because most of them are low give it
the japenese sense of pacing editing and musical score must be different than american tastes but surely this movie could have been so much more with a little more post production in hollywood needs to re-make this movie and i think it would be a big hit the story is interesting and creepy something about the edges of the city gritty policemen earthquakes sanitariums and mysterious saltwater killings that is enough to be captivating however this story has to make just a little bit of sense and maybe be about minutes do have to say that the sixth-sense effect was in full force in this movie and that was evident from the very it stands only the die-hard japanese film lovers should bother seeing this oh-so-boring movie
oh this was a really bad movie the girl who plays jennifer is ok but i think she acts bitchy through the movie not because she is having her organs ripped out by a raven at night but because she is thinking of firing her agent for putting her in this piece of crap faye dunaway acts like she is remaking mommy dearest and the ending is completely silly i really can't recommend this movie at all even though as a fan of edgar allen poe i was intrigued a bit by the references to his house of usher-like family being buried he would probably turn over in his grave if he knew about this film
this is the worst show buntch of grown up acting like kids no humor nothing even sesame street has better humor and more adult than friends friends may be the worst thing i've ever seen on television and i've been sitting in front of the tube observing friends simply does not stack up well to other contemporary series it lacks the smartness of seinfeld and the wonderful self-ridicule of pomposity that is the hallmark of frasier the characters in friends seem designed to make them repellant dullards this incestuous group of neighbors makes my flesh unintelligent show is completely without an edge of any sort the characters are caricatures of caricatures and the writing is sophomoric though intentionally so might be interesting to observe a writing session since the writers may have to slave to aim lower than their capabilities so as not to confuse the loyal friends of friends
there isn't much to say about this film it is acting and dialog are way far away from even decent the story of the hybrid is not very well explained and the whole thing has plot holes here and is something you wouldn't like to see it so amateurish that it makes me only good thing on the dvd was in the extras the gag reel everything else just waste of time and money i hope noone will buy this this is not even worth stay away of this
the biggest national lampoon hit remains animal house and rightly so it was funny raucous and exact opposite of every other national lampoon film including class do not be fooled by the inclusion of stephen furst from animal house or by the fact that john hughes wrote this jumbled mess this reunion is about as hilarious as root canal and twice as star and being generous then again i always thought most of my old classmates were demons vampires and serial killers too
the in this movie is downright hilarious and provides the only entertainment in this otherwise dull and derivative zombie flick i haven't laughed so hard in my life as i just did watching zombi i've seen some really bad dubbing in my life believe me seriously the filmmakers could re-edit this movie and release it as a comedy and make millions of dollars just that if falling off your couch laughing at the dubbing in a fulci zombie movie isn't your cup of tea then avoid this at all costs
even when i saw this movie at a teenager i wondered just how ironic it was that pia zadora starred in a movie about an artist who slept her way to the top as beautiful and sexy as ms zadora is even she couldn't keep this sorry-ass excuse of a movie from tanking not even her photoshoot for penthouse in which the lonely lady was promoted back in the day could keep this movie from tanking the only thing that could have saved this movie a completely different script give this one a miss
judging by the hype and other reviews on this site i was ready for an awesome horror movie focusing on junkies what i got was complete crap focusing on junkies i wonder if another movie called cookers that these people reviewed there are only main characters and none of them struck me as well-written or well-acted basically the whole movie i just spent shaking my head and marveling at the stupidity of these drug yourself a favor don't rent this movie rent cabin fever or some other decent horror movie hell rent mary poppins the animated penguins are scarier and more convincing than anything you'll find in cookers
i couldn't wait to see this movie about half way through the movie i couldn't wait for it to end all of the actors were delivering their lines like woody allen had just said say it like this then they said their lines on screen like they were trying to imitate woody allen it was so annoying we all know how will ferrell really talks and he doesn't stumble over his words like mr allen the comedy portion of this film was just as boring as the tragedy and definitely never funny or even entertaining i must admit that i have never been a major woody allen fan and this movie definitely has not converted me i think that his writing was just as bad as his direction this movie will go down as one of the worst movies i have ever seen
well this is a typical straight to the toilet slasher story short a bunch of adults becoming stranded in the middle of creepy woods and get hacked down by naked nymphomaniac movie has all the basics for this slasher women or young adults being marooned in someplace spooky death scenes last survivor being a well built young woman who will always show off her midriff but never bra less creepy crazy man who knows about the evil kiss scene being a killer then for a cheesy slasher film it was really terrible the atmosphere is totally dead nothing not even the sexually explicit scenes and nudity was enough to keep the male and lesbian female audience interested watching it felt like it was being watched with a nasty head congestion or a nasty head the demonic
the film is based on a genuine colin mcinnes wrote a set of three london novels absolute beginners city of spades and mr love and justice i have read all three the first two are excellent the last perhaps an experiment that did not come off but work is highly acclaimed and rightly so this musical is the ultimate nightmare to see the fruits of mind being turned into a glitzy badly-acted soporific one-dimensional apology of a film that says it captures the spirit of london and does nothing of the goodness colin mcinnes wasn't alive to witness it
does anyone think that this show actually helps some people or does it only anger the people who watch it when i am flipping through the channels and come upon this show i half to watch out of morbid curiosity i understand that pat roberson is not all together what i do not know is if his viewers are like him or if they are good people and think they will have a better life if they listening to what he has to say pat roberson is of little consequence he is an old man who thinks in an old way fear of damnation no longer has the same affects as it once did god now if someone will please answer my question i will be dodging lightning bolts for the rest of eternity
watching it lives by night makes you wonder just who in the world greenlit this crap a newlywed couple go spelunking on their honeymoon get attacked by bats and the husband starts to run around in his pajamas attacking various people and where exactly are they they're in the desert then they're skiing then they're in a small town that looks like it has mountains nearby the town is run by a sheriff who likes to watch and has a personal vendetta against whiny doctor boy the ski hospital is run by a really groovy guy with a nice thick mustache and the wife looks like mary tyler moore or marilyn quayle no dramatic tension and the ending will leave you filled with anger special effects and makeup guru stan winston did the effects for this movie i guess you have to start somewhere
and forget this completely if you really need to see madonna act rent body of evidence at least willem defoe is in that this film while the sets are beautiful you may want to mute the dialog you won't miss anything bruce greenwood is wasted jeanne tripplehorn is a prop and madonna is so awful it becomes amusing why they had to butcher the original film into this mess i will never know guess they thought it was bankable madonna as an actress certainly is you rent the original film from though you will enjoy it and the actors in it can actually act
i watched this movie purely for the setting it was filmed in an old hotel that a friend owns shares of the plot was predictable the acting was mediorcre at best the scares were all gross-outs not true don't remember much of the plot and i think because there wasn't much of one to remember they didn't even use the hotel to fullest beaches are fantastic and the hotel is situated on a peninsula at low tide you can walk almost mile into the bay which is actually an eerie sight first thing in the morning or late at night when the wind is howling through the best way to see this movie is with the remote in your hand so you can fast forward through the action i'm using that term and pause at the beauty of the surroundings
have you ever heard the saying that people telegraph their intentions well in this movie the characters actions do more than telegraph future plans they show up at your house drunk and buffet you about the head this could be forgiven if the setting had been used better or if the characters were more charismatic or nuanced embeth character is not mysterious just wooden and kenneth branagh doesn't succeed in conveying the brash charm his character probably was written to bottom line obvious plot one-note performances unlikeable characters and grotesque southern accents employed by british actors
by reading the box at the video store this movie looks rather amusingly disturbing you know the but supposed to frighten you this was not funny or horrific the writing was jokes failed to make me laugh even at their extreme were so expected the actors didn't even do much with such a not so good least i hope that wasn't their this movie at your own give it negative stars outta
at the beginning i was happy to know about a new superman movie i though that will be great but it a bad copy of the richard donner is again a villain that makes no more else even played by kevin evil plan is the same of the first movie of donner just a lot script is predictable and simple stuff luthor finds in a museum or an old story is the wrong thing it must be the kevin smith script and may be it could be just hope a sequel without brian singer and with a new talent director to do something new and not a read you later
this film is really unbelievable i've seen so much cheap trash-movies especially a lot full moon'-pictures but dollman is really hard so much comes together the laughable story the actors always at the edge of parody and the special effects how long i could talk about them it is a really bad movie but also one of the funniest ones if you're a fan of bad movies to laugh about you have to see it and don't miss dollman vs demonic toys it really funnier and worse
read on and take note you could save minutes of your life that bleak this film sets out to produce guessing a modern small town american christmas fable in the capra style if and absolutely fails i've been trying to think of one good thing about it and can't let me mention some of the highlights don't die they get to spend eternity as immigrant workers in factory angels are actually ex-cowboys who sit in trees santa can bring people back from the dead you send him a nice letter the plot i won't spoil it for you but there has to be some light in films if only to contrast with the darkness but there isn't any even the photography is bleak snow shown at the end of a freeze everywhere looking cold damp and miserable you might guess the film has a happy ending what a relief
i do have the to inform you to please stay away from the biographical film based on the real-life story of the grotesque serial killer strays more in relation to the mentality of its focused subject jeffrey dahmer who murdered over young males and ate some of their body parts was probably the most incongruous serial killer of our generation however the real sick individuals are the filmmakers of this awful spectacle who should have had their heads examined before deciding to greenlight this awful project this is not an easy film to digest even though jeffrey would have easily digested it with some fiery appetizers or even some real-life potato skins failure
a shaky hand-held camera was used presumably to give the film a documentary look but the effect was so exaggerated that i started to get motion-sickness just from watching it it looked like someone with cerebral palsy was holding the camera offense meant to cp sufferers but i don't think you would expect to get much work as a cinematographer the camera work was so nauseating and so distracting that my wife and i considered it unwatchable and gave up on it after minutes of torture i checked back a while later was showing on tv and it hadn't gotten any better i suggest giving this one a miss unless you need to get rid of any bad sushi you may have eaten
this was just plain terrible i read this book for school i made as on all of the tests and to see it like this my teacher forced me and other people to watch it and it was worse than leonard part plan from outer space and hudson hawk put together the thing that made this film so terrible was enough reasons to want to kill yourself over first of all it was made on hallmark second the acting was terrible third it was like completely different from the book literally it was so bad i asked myself to be excused basically i would rather watch basic instinct than watch this take my advice don't watch this film no one would want to watch this it was horrible horrible
i don't want to go off on a rant here is the worst film i've ever seen worse than the avengers incompetent directing disjointed writing and awful acting are the only consistent elements throughout shot on very cheap video it looks like a high school project but without the emotion the lighting frequently looks like a single sun-gun the sound is slightly better than a single mic on the camera but everything else about this thing is just awful the plot heads off in strange directions with no foundation or later resolution the techie elements are patently absurd and the editing looks worse than a rough cut not even bad enough to be funny just bad btw the packaging is intentionally gate owes me
this film has got several key flaws the first and most significant of which is the clear lack of a good plot this sadly makes the film not only difficult to watch but also sends the watcher certain feelings of hopelessness as if he or she is wasting valuable time of their short life this means that the film cannot captivate audience instead it encourages the viewing public to grow contempt for the film and everything associated with it in short it really is very very very very very very very bad do yourself a favour and chew on a large rubber shoe you'll find it far more interesting and enjoyable than watching terminator woman
the book that this movie is based on seriously changed my life but saying this movie was a disappointment is an understatement the acting directing cinematography and storyline were all horrible i would never recommend this movie to anyone i've told countless people about the book but will now be telling them all that they should definitely not see the movie i did not expect the plot to follow the book exactly but they have left out too many key components of the book the movie tried but failed to deliver a powerful and inspiring message and only demeaned the central theme of the prophecy while putting myself in the position who had not read the book i saw the celestine prophecy as a bunch of hoaxy i am thoroughly disappointed with redfield for the way this movie turned out
man this was hilarious it should be under comedy or stupid it would have made realizing what a pile of stank this was much easier seriously i want anyone associated with this movie tased effective immediately for everyone who is thinking of watching this movie go over a few plot points oh wait there aren't any there is literally no plot i think casper van dien was bored and he decided to film something with some random someones and miraculously it somehow got on videotape this movie is literally the worst movie of all time don't believe me go watch it do it man i dare you but be prepared to gouge your eyes out if you can sit through this without blowing a cow you are very strong and courageous
having lived in japan for several years this movie does not reflect the japanese culture and does not even come close to explain what being a geisha is all about unfortunately a great opportunity has been missed to bring the japanese culture a bit closer to the broad western audience and help demystify the country where zen samurai the geisha world of kyoto originate from some of the most poignant moments of the movie are when the americans are shown in japanese geisha dances were not authentic there was far too much use of chinese music a minor but essential detail proper use of the incense sticks was nowhere to be seen the sakura scenes were almost obscenely kitschy interestingly some of the chinese actors were quite convincing as japanese persons
something somewhere must have terribly gone wrong right at the time when the director was perceiving this plot the movie that was supposed to be the remake of one of the most loved movies in cinema fails to deliver in every aspect of movie making the best of the artists could also not pick up the tuning that simply goes on to show that the movie in itself was a grave editing is poor direction is crap acting is out of this the characters who are supposed to look scary force people to laugh on the stupidity of their dialogues and wouldn't watch the movie even if someone paid me the cost of the tickets or even gave me a free burger with it
collusion course is even worse than the typical evil white male corporate capitalist movie of the week this movie is less pleasant than a toothache jay leno can act good in his underrated debut movie the silverbears in which he gives a performance consist with the demands of his character this movie is so bad character a sanctimonious buffoon is less annoying than character a sanctimonious fool
ostensibly a film that predicts the coming trends in british popular music wrong on so many fronts that laughable tommy quickly the honeycombs the movie does include a song by the spencer davis group two by the animals and one tacked on live film of the beatles doing their live version of twist and shout but all in all an awkward display of british music circa oh and hermits
if bob ludlum was to see this mini series he would have cried this was complete waste of time and money i have read the book and even though movies are not exactly what the book may be cbs wasted time and money on this and it is embarrassing to claim that this was be the creator should check out the bourne identity with richard chamberlain and see how good that tv series mira blair anjelica and colm why did they sign to stoop this
the only way to get anything out of this film is to approach it as a comedy seen in that light it does deliver you're looking for a serious movie look somewhere else this film has absolutely no depth and offers little more than a cursory and one dimensional examination of issues with no insight a movie about stereotypes and then making every single character in your movie a stereotype is an extremely poor strategy especially when those same characters only break their hackneyed molds in predictable stereotypical ways rhymes and ice cube make the film almost watchable and michael rappaport turns in a good performance but the script is so awful and the social commentary is so trite hard to find anything redeeming
i will spend a few days dedicated to ron howard before i swear off his work entirely having unfortunately dealt with lucas at such a young age howard is now caught up in so many of lucas traits how else do you explain his rampage of disasters his only useful film of course has been willow everything else including this is too reliant on superficial can't even have semi-intelligent focus like peter weir no poor howard so stuck on his spielbergian knockoff qualities that he will be quickly forgotten we have the old adage love conquers all even disease too bad for howard that lynch already got through the whole subtext with more skill heck even disney did better than this ron even goofs up on the possibilities presented by imagined commentary track is just awful don't even rent the analysis cinematic dud
i know that movies aren't necessarily supposed to mirror reality but this one got on my nerves it perpetuates ignorant stereotypes about psychological trauma and mental illness the psycho mom thing has been done too many times before usually done better and much of the rest of the plot is far-fetched as well the acting was not horrible but nothing to rave highlight i am a long-time fan of general hospital and it was a trip to see one of the roles played by former gh regular jon if you can overlook the bogus psychoanalytical part of it in the same way a person must suspend reality judgment when watching a lot of movies then this movie might be tolerable if you have nothing better to do and fairly low sorry i spent my time watching it
this series just gets worse and worse poorly written and just plain not funny the premise is excellent but the inexperience shines through by trying so hard to offend no one they end up insulting everyone now into the second season the desperate cast have stopped waving their arms about and resorted to that patronizing smug oh silly you style acting that comes with a no laugh script they roll their eyes and shake their heads at each other as if to say aren't we zany isn't this funny well no not actually gum disease is less painful no wonder with the exception of corner gas canadians generally avoid canadian tv come on cbc you're suppose to be our leading station showcasing the best of canadian talent pull the plug on this amateurish mess
this film is a travesty no abomination no is without a doubt the absolute worst film ever made featuring beloved characters created and established by other thought inspector clouseau with alan arkin instead of peter sellers was ludicrous and sacrilegious but even daring to remake stan laurel and oliver hardy is asinine and money laurel and mr hardy have been dead respectively since and why anyone would even begin to imagine that suitable updates for l h would be in the persona of bronson pinchot and gailard sartain is beyond me i tuned in fully expecting to be horrified and embarrassed and i certainly wasn't disappointed everyone involved in this pathetic moronic disgrace should be blackballed from anything and everything associated with hollywood and film-making avoid this movie at all have been duly warned
faith domergue known as dr ruth in this island earth is the only reason to watch this film the story is very thin and once the air force buddies return to the states with a cobra curse upon them the action is just a waiting game see faith the snake woman and try to pretend the rest isn't happening
maybe i've seen one too many crime flick or maybe i don't take the right was the most clich√© ridden plot deficient plot-absurd just plain stupid movie i have seen in a long for the direction it looks like it took less time to show this than it did to put it fact it looks like to made it straight to video before it was a bad rip off of m the classic fritz lang film starring peter lorre you'd be so much better off renting that instead
blue monkey or invasion of the bodysuckers as known here in the uk was a pretty boring horror movie about an old man who gets bitten in a greenhouse by some mysterious toxic plant the man gets rushed to hospital where this worm like creature comes out of his mouth of course this transforms into this insect monster and proceeds to go on the rampage despite steve railsback and john vernon being in the movie i found it to be boring with a flat predictable storyline un-interesting characters cheap special effects and lack of action horror fans don't really need to track this rare movie down you wont be missing much trust me i give this movie
there was a genie played by shaq his name was kazaam and he was whack his rhymes were corny this lines were bad some stupid kid cryin over his stupid dad bad actin bad casting bad special effects whats next this movie sucks prolly didn't make bucks he lives in a boombox not a lamp hurts like a cramp like a wet food you get it a stupid rhyming genie who can't act in a stupid movie with horrible special effects oh and its confusing as hell i'm not even gonna go on just say it belongs in the its so bad its funny category watch it once with your buddies and get a good laugh but don't expect anything spectacular
whoever wrote up redline as a great car movie must be getting paid off by daniel sadek to promote this ultra crappy flaming steaming pile of amateur crap easily the worst automotive movie or any movie ever made this makes showgirls look like citizen every cheesy clich√© out of an action tv series put in some really crappy special effects and lame characters with no relevance and you have living proof that daniel sadek should not write screenplays and produce movies but should remain in the real estate is such a lame movie with such a lame plot and the most contrived action sequences ever what offends me is not that the makers of this film are idiots but that they consider the movie going public to be idiots enough to fall for this crap
i am a major fan of the horror genre i love flicks of all kinds some of my favorites are the really good bad horror flicks but this movies has nothing to warrant viewing i'm not going to spend a lot of time talking about everything wrong with script is horrid the acting is horrid the fx are not even worth discussing the set is an absolute joke the sad thing is i think there may be some real potential in a couple of the actors but this vehicle left them nothing to work it to say i saw it for free feel i was robbed the time you'd waste watching this would be better spent flossing your cat
i read the reviews of this movie and they were generally pretty good so i thought i should see it i'm a big francophile and art film lover but i believe this is yet another case in which the critics make something arty or intellectual into something it is not i will be blunt it contains scenes of sexual perverseness that i never ever wanted to actually see obviously the piano teacher has some major psychological issues but i really did not want to see them displayed so graphically the film is in essence disgusting i mean when i saw requiem for a dream i was repulsed by the last sort of scene with jennifer connelly but that was not anywhere near the sort of disgust and repulsion i felt during this film
the only thing remarkable about this movie is that all the actors could bomb at the same time idiocy i want my money i got it free from the library sheesh i would rather chew on tin fool and shave my head with a cheese grater then watch this again
i can't think of much to say about this film was an awful can't even tell you what made me decide to view it it had so few redeeming qualities that i don't even know where to plot moved from implausible to downright absurd my entire body was tense throughout the duration of the movie because i could not wait for the awful thing to be over and done by the end of the movie i found myself feeling beyond relieved editing was poor the acting was sub-par and the storyline was weak francoise robinson was cast as a native american even though she does not even closely resemble someone of native american heritage a movie is going to be this idiotic it should be laughably stupid at the very least it wasn't it was just pathetic
i can clearly see now why robin hood flopped quickly the first episode of it is probably the worst ever thing bbc has aired the opening scenes were about as intense meaningful and intelligent as two monkeys fighting robin hood had no character and the sword fight was just laughable the worst part of the episode was robin hood snogging some cow clad in make-up at the beginning of the episode how many people wore eyeliner in the century nobody the series may have improved drastically since then but this first episode quickly put hopes down and is essentially a pile of a great hero of england has been you tolerate this i won't for sure unless the bbc start to understand what is a wise investment
i gave timecop a perfect i gave this story is very boring and it has only little to do with the original timecop lots of things from timecop was scrapped and they put in new stupid stuff instead this story is taking place in i remember correctly but for some reason the timetraveling is now more dangerous the action scenes are nothing to be happy about well most of them aren't only the first one is great and there aren't many action scenes at all and they're all pretty one point in the story the main character travels through time about times within a few minutes no wait make that two short don't waste time watching this movie not worth it
this movie is about a young scientist who creates a serum that re-animates the dead he first uses it on his brother when he is shot dead in a drive by his brother then infects the other gang some scenes the zombies are seen walking very slowly and in other scenes they run pretty fast which makes little sense the acting is mediocre but the story doesn't help the film the makeup consists of blood on the face of the zombies the budget for this film i'm sure was very limited i believe the film could have been better made had the story been more original and with a better budget if you wan't to see a good zombie flick don't see this one
jane is one of the greatest novels in the english language and this screenwriter should of read it i hate it when writers use spark notes for what a novel is all about this movie is unbearable to watch if you have read the whole red room is so down played that i wonder why they even bother to put it in in the book the red room is foreshadowing for the whole story and the rest of life helen burns is treated so badly in the movie i'm sure she was happy to die and leave early in the book she is one of the most compelling characters and she was not the red head the whole christian theme is missing from her life and the rest of the yourself a favor and miss this movie and read the story as charlotte bronte masterfully told it
i am sorry to fans of this film but it is the worst thing i have ever seen cast and badly acted it is a film trying to escape the deadbeat romcoms of the recent years and failing mcdonald and parker seem unable to convey real emotion and are lifeless they seem to be in this one for any pay checks they are getting for it and not because they thought it was a good idea the plot is dull i love great chick films as much as the next girl and this is not one if you avoid one film this it be
spoiler alert personally i don't understand why pete did not help to save williams mean that would be great to know why william was think secret service members are every day there is a rumor the writer was a member of the secret motivations are as a rental this film will not satisfy the old but used average acting are just things in this for keep you wait the johnson as the director of did a far better work like this i still wondering how the producers example michael this film to theaters
i began watching this movie with my girl-friend and after minutes i was succeed to stay until the end it has been a painful liked jean hugues anglade but i think that he needed to eat as us and thus he accepted to play in this movie are only characters and the rest could be called art or something that i couldn't express but that i didn't understand at only worst movie i saw was crash but i'm pretty sure now that i have enough experience to watch it successfully luck o
there are two reasons why i did not give a to this movie one reason are some of the actors malcolm mcdowell and gwynyth walsh work who tried to play at their usually good level of acting however at many scenes they were somehow blocked by the bad other reason is the cool idea and looking of the cyborg which is quite different to most other such roles i've seen so else in this movie is as bad as it can be boring scenes useless and boring dialogs bad script work and it seemed as it was the first movie ever for many actors it could have been an interesting story though but they failed completely
if you haven't seen this yet i say just move on take a walk in the park don't waste your time neither the scenario nor the acting is worth your money i can't decide which was worse the movie itself or hairstyle ellen acting talent is very questionable i hope she can improve it over time the storyline is just unbelievable loose cannon american cop fighting criminals in europe on his own infamous slavic mafiosi protected by only two hunks an emotional art teacher leading a ruthless gang spanish police executive dumber than a sack of hammers give me a break only one good thing about this movie though at least the production costs must be lower than which was as meaningless and over the top as this one
unfortunately this film was a pathetic attempt of the true story of studio the only thing that was good about the picture was mike myers who was a joy to watch neve cambpell although her role was little was unfortunately bad the bottom line is that this film lacked a good performance from the actors except one and that the conversion of the true story was a desperate attempt for a good screenplay
this film ever got a star average is beyond me the script is so banal and frankly an insult to whomevers life it is based upon the cinematography comes straight from the slick world of advertising and the talented ridley scott should be ashamed demi moore however shows none a surprise by participating in this film if one looks at her tracklist all in all a high concept style film that even don simpson would be ashamed of
this is a film that makes you say things i can do much better than and directing this is so bad i must leave a review and warn as if it was shot with my flip video i have too believe my friend who told me to watch this has a vendetta against me i have noticed that there are some positive posts for this home video must have been left by crew members or people with something to do with this film one of the worst movies i have ever seen hopefully the writers and director leave the business not even talented enough to do commercials
curiosity led me to this masterpiece unfortunately i didn't rent it i bought it the most disturbing thing about this film is that not so disturbing for reasons known only to them the makers of this film set out to show the human side of jeffry dahmer are you kidding me the man gave new meaning to the term finger lickin good and with all the flash-backs and flash-forwards i had trouble following the story all in all jeremy performance wasn't too bad you can catch him in in which he plays a disgruntled ex-cop anyway i would rate this as a it only got a because of so-so performance there are plenty of books and tv documentaries out there that do a much better job of covering crimes avoid this one
i rented this movie for a few laughs i had never seen the snl skit but with hits like tommy boy and waynes world it couldn't have been that bad could it the answer it was this movie hardly was a means of relaxing after a hard day at work i just kept waiting for a plotline and a funny part but there wasn't any the highlight was tiffany amber thieson and thats just about it
very disappointing film by the end i no longer cared for any of the characters i did enjoy seeing ving rhames in a very small part and william macy was good as always still not worth watching it starts out strong and just keeps getting weaker and weaker insomniacs will like it as i am sure it will put them to sleep
they really can't get stupider than this film dealing with losers who try to capture the college spirit during the annual spring break festivities at many of our higher schools of learning the problem is that these losers try to do this years after their college years when one is assigned to watch over the daughter of a woman senator being groomed to be the next vice is that her daughter is anything but popular but of course she comes out of all that the girls go through drunken rages exotic dancing and other absolute really can't get much worse than this awful film
as a girl hinako moved away from her small village to tokyo leaving behind her two best friends fumiya and sayori she returns as a young woman surprised to find that sayori died when she was a teenager she reunites with fumiya and they are horrified to learn that sayori is mysteriously being resurrected via the island of shikoku oh boy i rented this because i like asian horror and i think chiaki kuriyama a nifty actress unfortunately if i had to describe shikoku in one word it would be fruity this movie is silly boring poorly filmed unimaginative and most of all unscary kuriyama has minimal screen time as the resurrected sayori and her character is given little to work with
so the big fuss out of making an indiana jones wannabe when you have an actor cast as a fictional dude from adventure storybooks who doesn't want to go out on an adventure whoever wrote the script for jake speed was probably fired but for whatever reasons possible this movie greatly lacks in excitement that doesn't mean it has no action but look on the dark side of the picture this has got to bare no resemblance to indiana jones or other action-adventure thrills containing cliffhangers and narrow escapes and jake speed was promoted that way using clever propaganda to make me and several others interested in it besides i've never heard of the guy so who needs his attention
i just saw this movie last night and being someone who had very low expectations to begin with was still disappointed the most glaring error in this abomination of a movie is that the main plot point guy being awake during the surgery had nothing to do with the outcome it would have ended the same way regardless so what was the point of this who knows also this surgeon had malpractice suits against him and he didn't think people would ask questions if a patient died on his table give me a break jessica alba is completely talentless and christiansen is almost as bad the whole thing was just laughable from start to finish i'm fairly certain that if you could feel someone cutting through your chest with a scalpel you would be in more pain than that
this movie supposedly a thriller had about five sub-plots that developed simultaneously to climax at the end but it ended up more as a writing was trite the pace was slow and disjointed and the characters were boring george clooney looks like he needs to get into a gym matt damon hammed it up and the others seemed to read their lines from a worst part of this movie was that it was carefully crafted to be politically correct and so it ended up saying nothing at all about big business oil and the middle-east i have seen documentaries provide more excitement watch it only if absolutely nothing else to do
i bought this dvd because it has kari in it and the mpaa ratings said rated r for strong violence and sexuality nudity and correctly imo should state rated r for strong violence sexuality nudity and word sexuality should come after a comma not an and because of the huge difference in meaning it make i think a lot of people who have watched this movie will agree with me that the sexuality and nudity parts almost non-existent my first impression when i look at the mpaa rating was that i will be watching something like vivid movie that is why i felt cheated story-wise it was so-so after-all who really cares about the story if the gorgeous kari was in it i know i course this is only my
what ever you do do not waste your time on this pointless movie a remake that did not need to be retold everyone coming out of the theater had the same comments worst movie i ever saw save your time and cage was biking down hills swimming in murky water and rolling down hills while being attacked by bees but yet his suit was still perfectly pressed and shirt crisp white until the very last a good cast with ellen bernstein and cage the acting was just as unbelievable as the movie itself it is amazing how good actors can do such bad movies don't they get a copy of the script first if you still have any interest at all in seeing the movie at the very least wait for it to come out on dvd
really stands for so incredibly crappy i killed myself there was absolutely no acting to speak of the best part of the whole production was the art work on the cover of the budgeting of this movie was sufficient the filming was sub sesame street the production looks like that of the underground filming for mob hits the props used in this movie were stolen from a clothing store the ending was so predictable you should fast forward to the last minutes and laugh if there is a book out there for this movie i'm sure better i would avoid this at all costs i did enjoy the intimate scenes they made the whole movie worth it just kidding
alicianne barnett becomes a live in babysitter for young rosalie nordon cole who has recently lost her mother but rosalie misses her dead mother a lot and continuously visits her grave located in a cemetery right behind the house late at she also meets her starts off good with a truly eerie sequence in the falls apart the story is thin and there is tons of padding to make the film minutes long the acting is terrible across the board cole easily being the worst badly directed with some of the worst editing i've ever seen in a motion picture scenes sound are just cut off with no rhyme or reason also the film has terrible obvious post-production for blood and it very little and what there is looks incredibly fake i've never seen such fake-looking like ketchup boring rightfully forgotten drive-in movie you can skip this one
my score for this crap for the technical only everything else is very bad film that makes no sense clearly it seems that creating a good script for film or television is almost a impossible mission easy to understand why politicians never say the truth they are among the biggest liars on the planet it is difficult to understand how to make films so pathetic must believe that taking people for morons perhaps it was reason to believe since of the films are crap because they are stupid and ridiculous and very bad scenarios you look at the price we give oscars we understand better why we continue to make films any more ridiculous than others oddly enough it was always money for such nonsense but it was not for education and health you still want to listen to this press super fast forward button least
if john waters had written and directed house of corpses after being struck about the head repeatedly with a heavy object the result would probably be something like the blood shed mildly entertaining for the first half hour but then it slides into a sort of featureless glop of constant screaming and people doing things to each others genitalia with electric carving knives cutlery and pliers susan adriensen cakes is incredibly annoying and terry west bullion is almost as bad in whatever it is doing in front of the the best thing about the blood shed is that it won't take most viewers very long to forget about it
i bought the dvd version of this movie on the recommendation of my wife who loved the version she saw aired in television but the version put to dvd was a disaster the lighting was poor to non-existent and entire scenes were simply excised in one instance adele is being put to bed and we immediately cut to another scene coming in in mid-sentence where the next night characters such as grace poole and mason are never even introduced leaving one to wonder if they'd dozed off for a few minutes during the dvd we saw was produced by platinum disc corp and even at it was a careful which version of this movie you buy we're sending this one back
this show proved to be a waste of minutes of precious dvr hard drive space i didn't expect much and i actually received less not only do i expect this show to be canceled by the second episode i cannot believe that geico will ever attempt to use the cavemen ad campaign ever again i would have preferred spending a night checking my hair for head lice than watching this piece of refuse i wonder what abc passed on to make this show fit into the fall schedual perhaps a reality show featuring the aflac duck in the event that i failed to express my opinion about this show let me be clear and say that it is not too good
i've seen many horror shows over the years like nightstalker that dealt with the wendigo legend so i was looking forward to an angry spirit causing mayhem to add flavor to the halloween season man was i mistaken the whole movie creates this sense of events about to happen that will be scary and creepy but then delivers a very simplistic tale of revenge and murder over the loss of some property ve-ery scary not this movie has a lot in common with cold creek manor another total getting harder and harder to believe anything hollywood puts forward about scary movies since they rarely come through with anything original and spooky anymore what idiots pay for such a bogus movie to be made go back to the drawing board fellas and do something useful with those millions of greenbacks you have to throw around
this movie was so ridiculous i never even finished watching it i actually thought someone had made their own version and dubbed it onto the dvd from the movie store this movie made me sick not because it was gory but because i wasted on it it looks like my brother and i went into a house and made the movie ourselves and edited slaughterhouse footage into it i am so ticked off even the btk killer deserves more credit than that it was not even accurate i mean come on the cow head was obviously made out of play dough or bubble gum omg i cant even get all the words out to explain it do not watch this movie
this was shown on the biography channel and was about as informative as a comic i gave it out of for attention to detail because for the most part it had a feel to it and the three ladies that played the original three angels looked like them so the make-up was was supposed to be a biography on the biography channel but it was void of everything that is normally usually seen in one of their biographies no interviews with surviving cast members crew members production team members etc or their friends families and any biographers of those people in fact i know just as much now about the programme as i did before i watched this film that was based on the biographical book as for actually learning something that no-one knew about the program and wasn't common knowledge well that never happened
i understand this movie was made on a very low budget but that is no excuse for the monstrosity that is grendel deathstalker the throne of fire barbarian queen conquest the invincible barbarian were all done on shoestring budgets and poor special effects yet they still managed to create cult classics by adding some scantily clad women warriors and a good sense of humor the primitive costumes dark castles and beautiful bulgarian landscape gave grendel the potential to be a very good low budget sword and sorcery film but the makers completely ruined this opportunity by using extremely poor cgi effects and colorless characters compare this film to beowulf it may not be citizen kane but it is a good example of how an entertaining low budget adventure movie can be made by using credible special effects and appealing characters
don't see this this was one of the dumbest movies i have ever seen its hard to be mormon sometimes when there are movies like this out there what a sad view of mormon life i can tell you if you did see this movie that it is not all like this at all in a singles ward if it was i don't think i would have made it through it its too bad that most mormon movies are made by a group of geeks who have nothing better to do the acting was so bad that my wife and i barely made it through i guess you could say that it had all the signs of a b movie or are there c movies just thought this movie sucked and was full of cheese i wish some mormons would start making some quality movies
i wanted to punch the tv watching it was torture i hated it never watch this movie the terrorists are annoying adam sandler is annoying i normally like him but not in this one i wanted to break the dvd this is the most irritating film in the world the comedian jealous of is obnoxious the only remotely funny part is the rocker with the black teeth getting all the girls it was so irritating i wanted to punch the tv do not buy this movie unless you want to annoy someone if you even like adam sandler a little bit don't buy it it will just make you hate him do yourself a favor if you see it in the store hide it to put everyone out of danger of buying it its a waste of the i paid for it
how can you take her hard-living glamorously violent bounty hunter story serious with accent absurd apart from that the visual style of the directer is nauseating and gimmicky the plot is a shallow boring confused gangster-movie rehash and the acting is unconvincing the film introduces new characters all the way throughout the film and is told in fragmented flashback mostly out of sequence seemingly just to keep you nice and confused the film ever shows you things that don't really happen and then later says that didn't really happen this happened see the killing of the first ladies what have we seen the first wrong sequence of events for choice in casting a convoluted messy plot and a headache-inducing directorial style
my mom used to work at a video store and got to preview movies before they came out so when she brought home the convent a horror movie i couldn't wait to watch it given that supposed to be scary but is actually downright hilarious i can say that in some weird way i like this movie the acting is bad and yes the cheapest movie i've ever seen but so damn funny what are you smoking ca-rack i didn't know this movie even was ever released i figured it was too bad so overall the movie is pretty bad gotta admit that much at least but i promise you you will get a good laugh out of movie kinda sucks but good for a laugh especially that guy that holds the dagger of despair the dagger of despaaaaaair
i watched this on the tube last night the involved first caught my attention the first scenes were attention getters some funny some sad good character development i felt that the latter third of the film diverged if it was not for the early part of the movie i would have stopped watching i kept watching wanting to how how it tied i feel that it never happened i especially did not like the extend period that several of the character were talking yiddish was that the other i recommend no i think not as other reviewers mention much of the slang is dated jive but it was not too distracting the ending totally turned me off
i can't stand most reality shows and this one is worst than the one with paris hilton and sure his company but you're fired or you're hired for how many seasons now after watching the show i wouldn't want to work for the guy with his ego and all and i think watching paint dry has more entertainment love to hear just one person get up and say donald i quit and take some of your money and buy a decent hairdo i see even trying to buy fame in the wrestling wwe i hope he gets hurt so i don't have to see his pathetic face anymore it must be sad to want fame so bad and have no talent and make an ass of yourself trying to buy it i'd give this show a negative mark if i could but it gets a and it doesn't deserve that
what else is left to read all the reviews here and most are right on however one person even went so far as to call this movie evil and that satan tainted it something along those lines evil wow what a shocker i mean tbn basically made this film open your eyes this was the very lowest grade of propoghanda nonsense that has come along in most terrifying thing about omega code is how much money they spent to make it if this movie can be made there are no limits and therefore we have no choice but to get ready for yentl and ernest loses the omega those of you who are into the biblical stories the new movie dogma will pickup where omega code never started
this movie is flawed on many fronts like many before it it portrays more of the mythology of the alamo than the history the production is poor overall giving the impression of a welfare project for lots of actors who might have otherwise had to work on hollywood squares this to me was the greatest flaw i know the ages and general personalities of the real alamo protagonists and the geriatric ensemble of tv actors chosen to portray them never let any hint of believability a native texan i grew up with the mythology i later learned more about the history i can accept a decent production from either perspective i prefer more historical accuracy but this never gave me a chance to enjoy it even john or fess versions had more life than this stolid mess while being only slightly less disappointing avoid it
oh man this s-u-c-k-e-d sucked i couldn't even get any camp value out of i sat through the whole thing on showtime don't bother waiting around for the naked scenes too late and only plastic jenna jameson is involved shows how much discretionary cash must be laying around hollywood just to get your name on the closing credits i guess showtime had to throw something in at next time i think i'd even rather be watching espn loop around every minutes
there were times during the movie i wish i had been beat to death the only reason i endured the entirety of the movie was because i couldn't believe how bad it really was and thought it must get better this truly was a horror film i was horrified that i wasted what seemed like hours of my life that i will never get back the other two hours i spent mourning at the loss please recommend this movie to whomever you wish to torture and tell them the suspense will kill them
how can a movie have ozzy osbourne and still suck i just don't get it trick or treat managed to do it this sucks and likes or treat is one of those movies i have to warn people about it is a vomit-inducing vile atrocity just begging to be viewed so you can feel that much worse about yourself trick or treat has no redeeming a movie about heavy metal it sure doesn't seem to grasp what heavy metal is or what it represents this movie manages to make heavy metal look lame and this was in probably one of heavy strongest hours that is quite a feat however or treat so bad you will be angry at yourself for having watched it that simple equation will hopefully keep you away from this brainless and gutless film
ok this movie was really unique shall we say carrie fisher was by far the most talented in the movie even though it is said she had a coke problem during the movie but she said that she can't remember to much of it well thats her excuse but whats everyone i can't imagine they all had a coke it wasn't all that bad i mean i guess the plot was ok and it had some pretty funny moments although the part where the guy gets that thing shoved in his head was a little too violent for my taste oh well i guess i was disappointed cause carrie fisher is like so awesome and this movie did nothing for her
i know the people and i did some of the animation and graphic design and the show is horrible they are rich little kids who don't have any talent and probably just begged nick to accept them alex has played the drums for one yearm i've played for the movie is terrible and so is the show this is the craziest most mixed up comedy that even isint funny i've ever seen it is so stupid it makes me want to barf it is just so crazy that nickelodeon would ever accept something like this and so dumb they are sooo stupid and weird i hate them and their show and think once nick realizes how stupid it is they will most hopefully take it off
david worst film even in which we serve was'nt as bad as this usually a film with a really good reputation like this one has at least some redeeming qualities which makes one understand why it might be considered a classic but after watching this i just could not get why this piece of crap was liked so much even back in i disliked the acting stiff upper lip british mannerisms story script may be quite witty at times but totally unfunny and soundtrack the elvira character is meant to be alluring and attractive but was in actual fact ugly and had a weird and annoying voice just another film that has convinced me not to trust a films reputation another very overrated british classic
kurt thomas in one of the series of gymnast olympic stars turned movie stars movies that mercifully only includes one gaylord in american least that one had janet one a gymnast using his martial arts and his gymnastic skills to save a european country from it could happen on a scale of one to ten a
how did this ever come into existence i generally love sci whatever films etc but i still expect them to be written without quite so much cheese as this the effects were sad the lines were sadder avoid at all costs i only ended up renting it because it was in the wrong case was looking for the sasquatch film with lance henrikson in it still haven't seen that one the idea of the film is actually a good one there was a lot of potential to make a great little movie here i just don't understand how something like this ends up like this go speak to the interested students in any high school and you'll find people who can write a better script
once in a while you get amazed over how bad a film can be and how in the world anybody could raise money to make this kind of crap there is absolutely no talent included in this film from a crappy script to a crappy story to crappy acting amazing
do you like stand up then stay away from the early rounds there are in fact good comics but unless they got some cute qualities they got a snowballs chance any controversial material and you are out and i think i hurt as much as the discarded comedians when i see who the crooked judges are letting out of my top made it further than the preliminaries of the finalists have given me laughs several of them have lifted their material elsewhere something the judges doesn't seem to have problems is more entertaining than a lot of what else is on tv but incredibly hard to watch without contemplating what it could have the producers changed the name of the contest to last clown standing all my criticism would loose validity maybe an idea
after life is a miracle i did not expect much hard to believe that these films were made by the same man as do you remember dolly bell for instance zavet is two hours of silly antics with no story the wild and unbridled humor of underground seems to have degenerated into pathetic buffoonery here it appears that kusturica has been going steadily downhill since he started making life-affirming comedies beginning with black cat white cat which i think was great but already had some disturbing signs of dementia i liked his early films so much and this is why especially disappointing to see something like this hope his next one will be great
i love b come wasn't even worth a ending was there was no real to mention that it comes to life on its mean no lighting storm or crazy demonic powers slow as hell and then they just start killing off the characters one by one in like a min time i won't even start on the part of the thing killing the one guy without its then you don't even get to see what jigsaw even does with his so called new jigsaw you have nothing better to watch paint dry before id recommend this god-forsaken movie to anyone and to make it even better the other movie totem you can see the guy throwing the one creature in the basement scene from the was funny as hell and probably the only good part of watching that waste of film
i went to the movie as a sneak preview in austria so didn't have an idea what i am going to see the story is very normal the movie is very long i believe it could have cut to without causing any problems to the story its the type of movie you can see in a boring night which you want to get bored more ashton kutcher was very good kevin costner is ok the movie is speaking about the us coast guards how they are trained their life style and the problems they face as there aren't much effects in the movie so if you want to watch it then no need to waste your money and time going to the cinema would be more effective to watch it at home when it gets on dvds
this movie is even a big step down form the typical fare dished out by bollywood the performances were horrible even boman irani who always manages to shine goes completely ott as the villain the soundtrack is not memorable either and in spite trying hard the female leads don't manage to be sexy vivek oberoi is capable of far better projects while fardeen khan seems to be stuck in similar fare for the time being but this monstrosity is even beneath his limited capabilities as an actor esha deol and amrita rao are horrible in badly written clich√© roles high time for indra kumar to hang up his directorial hat hope he never directs another eyesore like this future of hindi movies are in better hands now to sum it up stay far away from waste of celluloid
i don't know what it is about this director sam mraovich somehow messed up just about every little aspect in this movie i would normally say that this is a movie that should not exist but this movie may be the most important of all time this movie should exist for the sole purpose of being without a doubt the worst movie ever made i've seen bad movies in my lifetime but this somehow breaks what i considered bad into something much more hard to in this movie is hilarious but the single funniest thing is that mraovich himself considers this to be a great wow
oh dear lord this movie it was horrible i am a huge fan of horror movies and most of the time horror movies other people say are bad i like the actor who played scarecrow was amazing i will say that but this plot was awful it made no sense it had way too much gore and an unnecessary revolting sex scene at the beginning i do believe the director was trying to be shocking or whatnot but it just came out awful to add to the pile of festering crap they called a plot the actors scarecrow we're awful and i cared so little about them that i soon forgot who was who in conclusion this movie made me sick if you can avoid watching this movie in anyway please do
i had the displeasure of watching this movie with my girlfriend who like me is a fan of the first this movie down right sucked it lacked the magic of the first you could actually understand every word the mice said the animation is crappy the palace is much much different from the first movie new characters that were never mentioned before and were terrible luckily the prince didn't have many lines which kept him from sounding stupid basically its like the lion king except its different stories all told by the mice the reason i'm giving this a out of is because the songs not sung by the characters were the most enjoyable
i was babysitting a family of three small children for a night and their mother gave me this to show for them having just grabbed it at wal-mart earlier in the week all three children actually got physically ill while watching it i'm pretty sure it was the pizza they ate or something they all had picked up from school but really it could have been this film absolutely disgusting how any one can produce this caliber of trash is beyond me fortunately i turned off the film when i noticed the children were not responding and acting strangely for any parents out there i strongly advise you to refrain from letting young children view this movie
the shame of it there i was comfortable in the arm chair with a beer and a bag of popcorn bouyant in the hope of another splendid muppet night of entertainment what did i get disappointed how can the muppets go from the sublime christmas carol to this the humour was dreadful the songs were worse than country and western saying something and the plot was as confused and poor as blind pew i think the main problem was that they bit off too much in attempting treasure island a short tale such as christmas carol is perfect because you can weave the muppet high jinks around the need to drag the plot along stopped all the fun where do the muppets go next how about muppets wizard of oz
i watched the first minutes thinking it was a real documentary an irritatingly overly dramatic on camera i realized it was all staged i thought why would i want to waste my time watching this junk so i turned it off and came online to warn other people the characters don't act in a believable way too much immature emotion for a guy to travel half way around the world into a war torn country he acted like a kid and i don't believe it was because his character was so upset about the trade center trite and you seen city of lost children french dark fantasy film about a guy who kidnaps kids and steals their dreams i liked it
watching this i mainly noticed the ad placements dhl aquawhite strips rockstar and more one product placement after another quite obvious how this movie got its funding jessica acting is laughable any dick shouldn't ever get work because he plays the same lame character the story is just a backdrop for this very long commercial i can't believe this movie was even considered for theatrical release the longer you watch this movie the more you're embarrassed for everyone involved the only minor saving grace is larry miller and rachael lee cook who gets almost no screen time as cousin i'm embarrassed i watched the whole thing i would recommend avoiding this one
this film was totally not what i expected this film was called something else no one would even notice the difference between the two really strange because i cannot see the point the prequel and sequel lets just say don't make sense the don't even match maybe i am naive but ain't a vol vol meant to match up was in jail in the one and dies in the original and in the prequel he lives and don't go jail plot was ok but they should have changed round some actors and some of the story line and the name of the film and it would have been a good film really expected it to end like the other one started some one has a opinion on this post it please
honestly i don't know funnier this horrific remake or the comments on this board review had me in tears so funny anyway this movie is the among the worst movies ever and certainly the bottom of the barrel for sequels the omen name on the title made me stop and watch it this morning on hbo but a slap in the face to the other three especially the original there are so many classically bad moments but my favorite is the guy catching fire from the juggler at the psychic fair good times this movie is to the omen series what scary movie is to the entire genre avoid unless you're looking for a good laugh
i have to admit that by moments i had to laugh at how bad that movie was but the laughs were too few and since this whole thing was in no way a parody it felt more like an insult to the intelligence the worst acting i have ever seen from any of these people
i liked chiba in street fighter and i figured hey no matter how stupid this movie will be i'll at least get to see him kick some ass right wrong this is a dull dreary mess of pointless talking half-assed scriptwriting and meaningless scheming there are few action scenes of any kind even fewer martial arts scenes and the few that are are shot and edited so poorly that you can't even make out what in the world is going on the dub is also atrocious and perhaps the idiocy that is this movie is best illustrated by the fact that it supposedly features the italian mafia except they're all japanese avoid like the would see better martial arts by looking through the window of your local preschool karate class for five minutes
ok so i am like most people give me free tickets and i will go and see most things now that multiplex cinemas are so good remember the old flea pit single screen cinemas and i am the healthy side of in england this film was released as liar a dog it is a total waste of good celluloid for the photograpy and set only
never before has a film driven me to write a review but this was just stuck with it trying to find what it was about this film that made snoop pick it as his first serious role but frankly it was a poor this made a good book but it certainly did not work for me as a found it atmosphere and i found many of the scenes hideously musical maestro he may be but a serious actor snoop acting by dylan mcdermott and rose byrne was passable but not enough to carry a weak plot with feeble dialogue perhaps i have just entirely missed the point but to me it didn't fit into any didn't elicit any empathy with the characters nor did it create any fact i found myself praying for the end and quelling a deep desire to slap all three of the main characters
i read the running man from kings books as bachman and i felt for the main character john and his family this movie could have been so much more the trouble it was set during the big action movie craze i watched the movie and was in pain during the whole thing i felt nothing for the character and less for his cause yes it had funny scenes laughable though i think that it did not save the movie in my eyes if you read the book you can feel the climax and the fire in the heart of john as he gets his final give this movie a low number it may not have been this low if i had not read the book
almost as tedious to watch as it was to read evening is a gorgeously produced meryl streep walks in and quietly shows her other cast members how to act this kind of stuff vanessa redgrave is shockingly off in her role as the dying ann and claire danes is a cipher perhaps if vanessa and claire had switched roles we could have seen the vibrancy in the young ann that gave her entr√©e to the rarefied world of the story and we could have imagined that the older ann actually was dying was hoping the addition of michael cunningham to the writing credits would smooth out the jumpy storytelling but alas it gave me a headache
i watched free money last night it was the longest minutes of my life with such an intriguing cast i really thought that i was in for a treat especially since i'm a brando fan wrong what a waste of talent almost embarrassing to watch at times the cattle prod scene there were so many missed opportunities for humorous setups didn't they show charlie character going back to tow truck ugh it tries to be a slapstick comedy but i just wasn't buying into it skip this one only for die-hard brando giving it out of because i still think the worse movie ever made was skidoo
i have seen some pretty bad movies and this is right up there no plot to speak of like one of those bad coma episodes on a soap-opera i just wanted to smack that little girl because well lets just say real suspicious all the way through the movie the monsters running around wearing some bling was funny i also saw a bit of silent hill in there and i read that this was done by and or stared a finnish metal band lordi so no wonder that it didn't make much sense it seem to be a vehicle for promoting there band and nothing more the fx are very good the look of the movie the monsters and even the acting also good but the story and the telling of it just aren't there
this film the days to glory is utter rubbish the acting is awful it is far too patriotic and its historical accuracy is not always at its best would have a field day it does have a few good moments but not enough to keep interest because it is far too long rating out of
this is just usual indian garbage that gets turned out as cinema as indians we can proudly boast that we have the biggest cinema industry however it also the can other poor countries have films with real characters that challenge the views of their respective societies and we just keep on pumping out garbage take a look at russia iran china and latin america look at the brilliant films they have and we get crap like real people no wonder the international community in general laughs at indian cinema
this movie was based on actual fact i sincerely hope get to see what appears to be numerous armed cops empty an equal amount of guns at guys who only got armored a great idea aim for the me but how about those big fat unmissable heads or their legs for crying out loud or were there invisible tanks protecting them were they from i miss something movie started out decent enough but after minutes of shoot-out it really takes a turn to that documentary style didn't work for me either but thats just something one finds likable or unbelievable stuff which makes it hard to see it through til the for the fine editing
man this movie sucked big time i didn't even manage to see the hole thing girlfriend did though really bad acting computer animations so bad you just laugh to werewolf strange clips the list goes on and on don't know if its just me or does this movie remind you of a porn movie and i don't mean all the naked ladys something about the light or something this could maybee become a classic just because of the bad acting and all the naked women but not because an original movie white a nice plot twist my final words are don't see it not worth the time if you wanna see it because the nakedness lots of better ones to see
some might scoff but there is actually a real art with making particularly bad films this misses out on all bunch of young people women with heaving breasts and continuously wet t-shirts naturally go to film blood surfing and end up running into a foot only was the croc obviously fake but some of the props the boat hitting the reef in particular look like they've come out of good from start to finish don't see it
there are so many comments on this film yet i found them to be misleading this a corner-cutting over-used scenario where a normal human being becomes a partner in crime to someone of the opposite sex for no apparent reason boy meets girl girl holds boy up at gunpoint for something ridiculous boy is intrigued know the drill the antagonist turns out to be a wild free spirit instead of a sociopath toss in a few words of wisdom from alice drummond and you have a recipe for love is she crazy or does she just need a hug role from the breakfast club simply reeks as a lead character and all that is left is a truly ghastly turkey of a movie
after highlander i am still in denial about i thought is was impossible to make a sequel that could make me cry because it was so bad i was wrong i loved the original wargames however this movie is inaccurate with computer details and details about the original movie the original wargames at least had some hacks that worked whoever wrote this movie knew nothing about computers except how to use a word processor i doubt he or she even watched the original movie the acting isn't even convincing please save yourselves under no circumstances watch this movie i don't care if the channel is stuck on the tv and you can't turn the tv off this movie will ruin your life
first of all i became dissy after watching this movie for five minutes of the bas screenplay i don't think this movie has any purpose boring from the first minute to the last i don't understand why this movie scores so high i gave it but actually not more wurth then
simply put this is the worst movie since police academy mission to moscow you liked that movie you will probably like this were they thinking some ideas should stay just that an idea the fact that this idea could itself to film should be a criminal was so bad about it i hear you ask one word to hire cost in time to watch want a refund on both
the van is a feelgood movie about a guy who tries to lure girls into his new van in order to seduce them the only thing this movie doesn't fail at is precisely depicting the van fad in the us in the late it looks like it was totally made by amateurs trash but i loved it i have to admit i am a fan of trash hope this one makes it to the imdb bottom
i have been reading the reviews for this movie and now i wanna kill my self i don't wanna live in a world where people find this move or rob schneider funny what is wrong with these people i'm not angry at rob schneider because he has the intelligence of a dead cat i watched this film in disbelief who would pay money to make this this film is so bad that its painful most bad films are funny because they are crap the animal is just disgusting watch this film and if you like please for all of man kind kill your self we don't need you i want to raise money to get rob scheider off all movies if someone killed rob schneider they should be given a nobel peace prize
i was about when this dire monstrosity of a film was released in the uk it was advertised on the tv in the summer of for weeks as if it were some incredible blockbuster film it was actually the first film i ever saw at a cinema and i was put off going for years to come the following week i was invited to go and see the new film star wars and i declined to this day i have never seen it in protest at having to watch sasquatch seriously even at the age of i could tell that i was watching garbage just so bad almost unbelievable rambling nonsense that should never have made it to a cinema i was however amused to read all these years later that the director never directed again just as well as far as i'm concerned avoid at all costs
how can there be that many corrupt cops without any one of them slipping up with enough cops to run a mini-war that include such weapons as flamethrowers you would think they would have been caught before someone writing for a weekly coupon newspaper overheard someone saying thanks to a corrupt will never get your minutes back life is too precious to rent this feel bad for the big named actors that made the mistake of making this you like justin timberlake feel free to rent this movie he does have a very major part in it so fans might enjoy seeing him i believe most of his fans are young girls who may be turned off by the violence in this movie
stupid mindless drivel about a jet assembled within hours by mechanics who have never worked on airplanes by burgess meredith chasing a porsche race car which runs on decades-old gasoline sludge driven by lee majors with chris makepeace as the runaway techno-wiz who can mcgyver spare parts into a radio receiver which can pick up all frequencies simultaneously and who somehow learned how to acquire and use chemicals to make high explosives in a perfectly peaceful society as moronic as it sounds terrible waste of burgess meredith but chris makepeace may at least be forgiven on the grounds that this was only his second film
warning avoid this super duper awful you watched it you will be sooooooooo and denise are grandma age now what are they doing trying so hard to be young innocent and sexy just not working at all pam and denise act so horribly in this the script is absolutely atrocious i can't believe someone can came out with such crappy ideas with the development of movie industry movie lovers are not as easy to satisfy as the ones in the last century i bet the movie goers from last century will hate this away from it i think watch white chicks from so much better that no mistake at that time i thought the worst movie i have ever seen
i was true to my regard for mr glover and ms goldberg i watched the entire film with my family and some friends i have no idea what the movie was about after much discussion we all agreed that this was not one of their better doesn't hang together very well it is too choppy and there is little comedy i am disappointed it could have been much waited months to see this film based on the liner waste your money unless you are a completist and just want to see all of mr and ms was a poor way to spend an evening
although misty ayers stripper is certainly attractive as the blonde lead this flick is just an excuse to let her strip down to her underwear a few times nudity in when this film was made not guy who hires her to work in a whorehouse resembles bud abbott of abbott costello most of the other woman are unattractive and the drunken woman is semi-amusing in a creepy out of ms ayers has a curvacious physique but you can't judge any acting talent because the entire film is post-dubbed some of these exploitation films usually made later than this one are interesting in some way but this is really a bore fest sid melton room for daddy directed there are some samurai-like facial expressions and interesting apartments but really nothing here
this movie has got to be one of the worst i have ever seen make it to dvd the story line might have clicked if the film had more funding and writers that would have cut the nonsense and sickly scenes that i highly caution parents on but the story line is like a loose cannon if there was such a thing as a drive thru movie maker-this one would have sprung from reminded me a lot of the quickie films that were put out in the poor script writing and filming only sensible characters in the whole movie was the bartender and beaver the rest of the film could have easily been made by middle school children i give this film a rating of as it is truly awful and left my entire family with a sense of being cheated my advice-don't watch it
this movie was pretty much a waste of an hour and a half of my time i generally like the cheap horror monster type movies but this movie was a disappointment the main flaw being the lack of explaining the creatures when they entered the house and found the man he could have at lease explained them he doesn't really say anything about them other than that they killed his parents and unless i missed something the didn't say how he managed to escape either not to mention the fact that it gives no clue or reason why the only survivor stays and essentially feeds the creatures after her own near death experience it would have seemed that she would have had the opportunity to leave after the cross incident
i don't know what would be so great about this movie even worse why should anyone bother seeing this one first of all there is no story one could say that even without a story a movie could be worth watching because it invokes some sort of strong feeling cry fear but in my opinion this movie does not do that are just watching images for hrs there are more useful things to guess you could say the movie is an experiment and it is daring because it lacks all the above but is this worth hrs of your valuable time and eur of your money for me the answer is no
ed wood is eclipsed and becomes orson welles this film is fantastic vampire witches who fight in terribly choreographed scenes and dialog that could have breaking ribs with laughter plan from outerspace dons't stand a chance against this described by the writer and psychic stephen armourae on the vampire forum as a from england and thoroughly has stephanie beaton and the producers know whats going to save them from bankcrupcy by repeatedly using her though she leaves me cold as she looks more like the undead than all the devil raisers and eileen daly is just a lower rate elvira the whole thing is badly it for the script though
to describe this film as garbage is unfair at least rooting through garbage can be an absorbing hobby this flick was neither absorbing nor bacon can act superbly given the chance so no doubt had an irs bill to settle when he agreed to this dire screenplay the mad scientist story of hollow man has been told before been told better and been told without resorting to so many ludicrously expensive special of those special effects seem to be built around the transparent anatomical dolls of men women and dogs you could buy in the early seventies in the uk they were marketed as the transparent man which is maybe where they got the title for this special effects dire script non-existent
i have always liked spike movies but this one was a total waste of hours i expected more about son of sam and instead got a movie that seemed to have very little to do with the serial killings the talking dog was laughable know you're in trouble when all the movie patrons burst into laughter inappropriately the whole movie seemed very disjointed and not very interesting the sex scenes were totally irrelevent to the plot i'm not opposed to sex in movies but it should have some point a xxx movie all in all we were very disappointed at this spike lee effort
this was a painful example of a cheap boring and unoriginal show produced by australian tv stations to fulfil local content quotas the writing was truly terrible and i'm not surprised that the writers are those responsible for the worst australian film in recent memory the honerable wally about this tv series was funny ever not even mildly amusing it was just tired and bad and worst of all it really thought it was funny it was simply embarrassing to is something very suss about this show being given out of on imdb try to find a review by a australian viewer of the show weren't many and it is impossible or crazy there are loafs of bread that are funnier than this show the show at all cost and if it does come out on dvd remember that the laughter that deserves was unintentional
vovochka is your everyday hooligan vs authority movie vovochka the main character is branded early as a bad influence on the children in the neighborhood with the words of wisdom from a couple of grownups he meets along the way he finds changing his mischievous ways hard yet worthy of doing personally i found actor who played vovochka too annoying to sympathize with however the change of tone of the movie would allow most to feel the emotional struggle vovochka has when he wants to be good but bad things still happen this struggle makes the movie a little different than other movies of the same genre the little flavor i meant all in all i did not really care for this movie although it was most likely aimed for a younger audience
watching this movie is like eating a banquet of nothing but meringue it initially looks great but ultimately provides no plot is a muddled mess about a toy factory and the forces of evil so how is it possible that with this basic plot and robin williams that the movie still turns out so badly because the picture is all appearance with no substance like the terrible popeye picture williams did at the beginning of his film career the film must have cost a fortune but perhaps there wasn't enough money left over to hire writers who had graduated grade film is one unfunny joke that goes on and on and on and on i really am unsure why it was made in the first certainly wasn't made to provide any sort of entertainment
lage raho munnabhai is really a disappointing movie i have seen the first part of munnabhai and it was really good but this one really make u bore n disappoint movie really waste yours time and money i went with my friend to this movie on the first day of its release and v both get bore in of circuit was very small n useless n this movie i think sanjay-dutt cut down the role of arshad of the movie is also not well define like the previous one this movie show u the result of over-confidence ideas of mahatma is also not define and really very big disappointment
watching this movie was a waste of time i was tempted to leave in the middle of the movie but i resisted i don't know what ridley scott intended but i learned that in the army women get as stupid as men they learn to spit to insult and to fight in combat and also a waste of time my opinion and anyway what the hell was that final scene in lybia are they still fighting gadafi or is it that easy for everyone to believe islamic people are always a danger
hello i am paul raddick panic attack of wtaf channel in philadelphia let me tell you about this god awful movie that powered on adam film career but was digitized after a short overboard is about an aspiring comedian played by sandler who gets a job on a cruise ship and so i thought sandler encounters babes that like history of the world part and rebound the babes were supposed to be engaged but actually they get executed by sawtooth the meanest cannibal the world has ever known adam sandler fared bad in going overboard but fared better in big daddy billy madison and jen favorite first dates man drew barrymore was one hot chick spanglish is red hot going overboard ain't dooley squat end of file
mercifully no video of this wannabe western that a stay-afloat vehicle for big frank at a time when his career was floundering the story of a weasel who lives on the reputation of his big gun brother and who gets run out of town by bad guys only to return to rally his townfolks with a new found courage must have been written by a back-room writer all in all this show stinks the story is basically boring ill-conceived and so naive that it can offend your intelligence i must depart complete from the other reviewer who found it underrated the critics slammed it at the time and deservedly so you'll have to catch it on the last show if you up late and having a bout of insomnia but if you can sit through it you've more fortitude than most of my movie buff friends
christian slater tara reid stephen dorff frank c turner mathew walker will sanderson directed by uwe on the video game director uwe boll attempts to recreate the game into an action-packed nail biter sadly he doesn't succeed instead he makes one of the worst movies ever made even though he gets minor celebrity such as christian slater tara reid and stephen dorff his movie lacks the necessary fundamentals that a movie needs to be good such as a story line and some basic relativity of going on in the dark and the light the movie bounces all around and uwe boll has no creative control and not to mention the bad cgi used on making the monsters even though they did look cool and the feedings were well a little lame honestly this is one of the worst movies ever made my final rating
yes in years of film going i have finally viewed the stinker that surpasses all other ghastly movies i have seen beating good will hunting baise moi and flirt for sheer awfulness this is pretentious blige of the first order not even entertaining pretentious bilge the effects are cheap and worse script seems to have been written by a first year film student who doesn't get out much but wants to appear full of portent the acting is simply undescribably bad tilda swinton caps a career filled with vacuous woodeness with a performance which veers neurotically between comotose and laughable intensity apparently some fool out there has allowed the director of this film to make another one be warned
this movie represents the times it was made in as much as the original i suppose which is really sad because at a deeper level the title vanishing point the original is so ironic i'm sure it wasn't intended that way but the original was filmed in and released in the real vanishing point was the end of an era which pretty much ended in the early this remake all the counter-cultural elements have been stripped away and been rendered more pc in an attempt to reach a broader audience presumably sanitized for your protection the american indian scenes was gratuitous and the idea of a noble purpose to the trip was subtraction by addition i'm glad i watched it however it made me appreciate the original that much more the original is a cult classic and golden this remake is dreadful
awful awful condescending remark at the start and a few nasty autopsy photos does not a good movie make once again i'm amazed at the determination and skill that some people have in achieving a movie production and yet they don't have the pride to realise that what they have made is an utter pile of sat and tried to think of a redeeming feature so that i could at least balance my criticism but the only one i could think of was that the opening track by pink was pretty wonder if she has seen this at your peril the boredom may kill you
one of my best friends brought this movie over one night with the words wanna watch the worst horror movie ever i always enjoy a good laugh at a bad horror flick and said yes i had expected your typical cheesy b-slasher but this was beyond b this is z-slasher the lowest of the low with obviously low budget extremely bad acting bad lightning no plot really bad so-called special effects shaky cameras and a horrible soundtrack this makes movies like house of wax look like oscar-winning masterpieces the only good thing about it is about seconds of one of the characters getting topless she had some very nice tits most of what i said during this film was along the lines of wow this is actually so bad this is the worst movie ever and i'm not drunk enough for this so in conclusion don't waste your time money
rented it last night the ran waaaaaaaaay too long the hitchiker scene served no purpose some skits were just retarded i knew beforehand chevy chase was on for less than minutes no problem here are the best uranus babs commercial curtis mayfield minutes of good material out of a minute else was either unfunny or stupid as me give you some advice if you want a crude movie spoofing tv and movies rent kentucky fried movie if you want a less crude movie spoofing tv and movies rent amazon women on the moon or don't bother renting this movie you'll save ken best movie is still modern problems
i'll be blunt i'm not one for politically correct movies where the woman plays the bad ass not going to take any crap from anyone if any one of the cast members wanted to they could have just taken her out in a heartbeat it was entertaining on mst but don't rent the real version trust me have i ever lied to you
the original les visiteurs was original hilarious interesting balanced and near perfect must be a candidate for worst first sequel to a really good film in everyone keeps shouting when a gag doesn't work first repeated another times with some vague hope that it will eventually become funny is a horrible parody of except of course that a parody should be inventive if you loved just don't see this film just see again
not worth the video rental or the time or the occasional that a child can do was over directing was very things made no sense or just seemed gratuitous was badly dubbed was highly inappropriate was extremely have been on crack that talk let dance pisses me off the bad crap as horribly casted as he was the best looking zombie of all which doesn't say cover art was good but very was the main menu of the artwork and bother
in a movie that follows a struggling actor played evidently by a struggling actor this does no favours for chris klein he struggles to bring anything memorable to the role and meanders on through the shallow script managing to display what could only be described as a bland leading man the story exists but that is all and fails to show any basic start middle and end and the viewer is left shrugging his shoulders feeling as though nothing in the past hour and three quarters has really bright light in the midst of this is fred durst who manages to stand out above his seemingly averagely talented co-stars and does a semi-decent job of bringing the backward character of legde to life whether fred can re-create this when working with a higher calibre of cast remains to be seen but i'l be watching out for him in future
i don't buy kung fu movies for a plot i buy them for fight scenes a bad plot can be forgiven for excellent fight scenes but not the other way story was decent but moved too slowly for my tastes there were about or mediocre fight scenes throughout lasting only a couple of minutes apiece the last fight was a bit longer but by that point i was so bored i didn't even pay attention to it
this movie is supposed to be a lighthearted tale about santa claus and his magical and mystical wonders but instead it comes off as being downright creepy two things in this movie that stand out in my mind as horrifying are the way santa have you ever seen a more horrible looking santa claus and the evil rep of satan just plain odd dances are just sickening to watch only watch this movie if it happens to be the msted version or if you like a very good laugh i can't believe this is a movie
this is the first time i'm writing a comment on a movie on imdb but i had to write it for this one its hrs of unadulterated torture from the starting u get the idea that the movie is gonna be bad the acting is pathetic i'm a big fan of ajay devgan him in bhagat singh but he is at his worst in this movie amitabh seems to have worked hard for this one but somehow the fear is missing prashant raj is a non actor and the most irritating part of the movie is nisha kothari i have no clue why the director took her in this movie the background score is repetitive somehow i felt that ramu tried to repeat a sarkar the color theme the background score the camera angles but it didn't work please don't watch it
now i hired this movie because brad dourif was in it he is an excellent actor brilliant in this movie and i think that was only because he realized how stupid this movie was and didn't bother with a good performance this movie is a unintentional-comedy some of the lines just crack me up and them there are some lines that make no sense and it seems like tobe hooper just throw lines in without thinking about the plot oh btw the plot is bad but it one of those films that is taht bad that its actually painful to watch i recommend this only for big brad dourif fans or fans of any of the other actors because the plot is pathetic
i read that a girl in my soup came out during peter low period watching the movie i'm not surprised almost nothing happens in the movie seemingly the very presence of sellers and goldie hawn should help the movie it doesn't the whole movie seems like they just randomly filmed whatever happened without scripting anything maybe i haven't seen every movie about middle-aged to elderly people trying to be hippies but this one gives such movies a pretty bad in all both sellers and hawn have starred in much better movies than this so don't waste your time on this pretty worthless
this movie only gets a second star because i work downtown and liked seeing it destroyed the effects were pretty i hear it was the most expensive korean film ever made being the most expensive and still absolutely horrid makes it a massive waste of money i rented it so i won't complain too much about what i paid but it was a couple hours that i'll never get back plot holes abound terrible acting all across the board i do not recommend giving up the time to watch this movie life is too short if your friends want to watch this run away i can't stress enough how bad this film was the hell did the second dragon come from why didn't he show up sooner how did they have rocket launchers on dinosaurs just years ago
the first ten minutes of this movie about making an international movie in belgium are fine you see real chaos on the set a producer on the edge of a nervous breakdown the cool has been-director rourke the bad tempered star etc you have seen everything before but well done but then the rest of the time the film just repeats itself the same ten minutes over and over again no climax no dramatic development no good acting not even bad acting it just goes on and on and on mickey rourke has two good minutes when his character talks about his up career in a scene where reality and fiction meet altogether that makes good
jameson parker and marilyn hassett are the most unbelievable couple since john travolta and lily tomlin larry direction wavers uncontrollably between black farce and roman tragedy robert klein certainly think the former and his self-centered performance in a minor role underscores the total lack of balance and chemistry between the players in the film normally i don't like to let myself get so ascerbic but the bell jar is one of my all-time favorite books and to watch what they did with it makes me literally crazy
this movie has some of the worst acting that i have ever seen some scenes are original such as the nails coming through the floor this nail trap catches these bad guys the rest of the movie degrades as you go i can't believe that this movie is not even in the bottom movies of all time i also can't believe that there are sequels the next crap movie that i want to watch is could really be much worse than
i won't waste a whole lot of time of this one because as far as i'm concerned it isn't really a movie to start with just a careless mish-mash of borrowed footage and embarrassingly amateurish new footage made solely for the purpose of pasting the whole mess together and call it a boogeyman sequel literally of this film is stolen from its far superior predecessor the boogeyman a film that the writers of this garbage apparently didn't even bother to watch because they couldn't even get actress suzanna original name right and to add insult to injury the killer is invisible in the original footage and visible in the new footage apparently they think their audience is as stupid as they are out of and i wish rating system went that low the most callous and blatant attempt to rip off money i've even seen you have been warned
i absolutely adore the toxic avenger series but this weak offering by the troma people didn't make any sense and it had me yawning all the leaking nuclear plant the growing weed next to it makes the youngsters of tromaville high go nuts which causes them to join a gang have sex explode and whatever also some sort of monster breeding in the high school my god this a actors pretty much stopped their efforts after this one and they should the overacting started to get on my nerves in about
an avent-garde nightmarish extremely low-budget film that has delusions of grandeur hard to sit through i get the message that child abuse is wrong wow big revelation i had no clue it was wrong before viewing this yes sarcasm don't watch this film if you're offended by nudity of either the male or female gender don't watch it if you're the least bit squeamish don't watch it if you care about acting on second thought just don't watch it grade the movie the with kristie bowersock deleted scenes movie stills commentary versions of the teaser trailer music video by the azoic a classroom video experiment
ho-hum an biological weapon is in danger of falling into the wrong hands unknowingly his been working on the antedote all along enter cia agent olivia d'abo and the cat-and-mouse car chases and gunfire begins also in the cast conti hendrick haese and an aging roger moore moore seems to haggardly move through this mess definitely not one of his better efforts perry fans will be accepting d'abo is wrong for the role but nice to look at
yes mtv there really is a way to market daria what started as a clever teenage on everything that sucks and make the viewer feel better about their sucky teenage life sitcom now mutated into a how you should deal with your i used to watch daria all the time and loved it now sitting here after watching the so called movie i can only wonder what the point of this all was daria tells us how to lead out life in college excuse me didn't the point daria made every episode that what you like to do is ok as long as it is ok with yourself no matter what the rest of the sick sad world thinks of it this entire thing reminded me of the scene in reality bites the movie channel shows the documentry for the first time
bugs bunny accidentally ends up at the south pole while trying to vacation in florida where he meets a little penquin which he tries to save from an eskimo this short tries and the penquin is adorable but in the end a bit too light in the laughs department the eskimo isn't really that great of a foil for bugs and i just seen a lot better bugs bunny cartoons frankly even other shorts when paired with other unknown antagonists so i can't in good conscience recommend this one however it is nice to see it in uncut form this cartoon is on disk of the looney tunes golden collection volume grade c
amazing that this movie turns out to be in one of my hitlists after all it is by far the number worst movie i have ever only have i ever been this bored before not for more then hours the pre-adolescent attempts at humor that feature it are not even close to getting but one of the corners of my mouth slightly tilted after the first very awkward part you tend to hope that the other parts will be at least slightly better you hope in vain it only goes downhill from movie has no story worth telling whatsoever and repeats this non-story three times one can only hope that by some miracle all remaining copies of this movie are lost forever and trent harris never lays his hands on a camera again
words really can't describe how bad this film is i thought zandalee was bad but at least that had some nice shots and the occasional good chin stroking moment here and there to stop you from nodding off this is just laughable terrible script poor direction awful acting and you know what i can't think of a single thing to recommend about it other than the fact that it isn't too long if you want minutes worth of entertainment book yourself in at the dentist and have some root canal work far more enjoyable and much better value for money that you need it incidentally i need to type lines of text to complete this review please do not buy this movie it is terrible
i did not think this movie was worth anything bad script bad acting except for janine turner no fantasy stupid plot dumb-ass husband and unfair divorce settings if you have never seen this movie before don't even bother not worth it at all the only thing that was good about it was that janine turner did a good job acting husband is a stuck up smart-ass defense attorney who has won a lot of cases and even gotten guility murderers off he think he is so smart but he is really just a nut her best friend has an affair with her husband and betrays her nice girl huh yeah a real peach not no day at the beach either
dude really where have you guys been the past years this is shocking in all kind of ways horror this is a joke there is nothing wrong with being low budget but this is a laugh if you want to look at the classics freaks of tod browning the victims of dracula and frankenstein the undying monster ernest thesiger paul the golem and the passengers of the ghost train you can't compare it it gives it a bad name bad acting bad screenplay etc total waist of money and free time have watched a lot of movies were as horror is my all time favorite i really am speechless have nothing more to say that please don't do the effort to watch something so daft please understand
guys who-ever even thinks about watching this movie has already got some disturbance going through their heads this movie has nothing to do with jack the ripper you thought its another b i mean e-grade movie comprised of a bunch of horny teens in certain sex scenes being watched just before they get their spleens splattered on a nearby tree its not scary funny or amusing if you really feel like gory stuff with no plot then watch cabin fever at least the director did not fall asleep midway through directing this watch this if you absolutely have nothing to do in life the only thing on tv is oprah winfrey crying on the tv set
someone should tell goldie hawn that her career as a teen-age gamin ended thirty years ago is one of the worst films released in years an unequivocal disaster in which the two leads give themselves over to a frenetic exposition of their trademark tics in an effort to make up for a bad script and bad directing this thing should have been smothered at hope john cleese got paid a lot for having his name attached to this disaster he is the only performer who came through this stinking mess more or less unscathed his only fault being a failure to realize that the rest of the cast would sink the picture
it is difficult to find any positives in this movie seems as though the producer needed to make a buck without much effort hence we are treated to a full showing of galaxy which is the lamest excuse for a movie in history the police girls looked extremely sexy in their little uniforms more action shots of the two cops a lot less of galaxy would have been the way to go of course that would add to the budget so they decided to fill the space with that wretched rerun ms albright does excellent looking sexy her acting is first rate ms stabs whom i had heard of but not seen on screen before also looked very desirable but seems to lack basic acting talent apart from ms albright this is real garbage
i'm a big fan of troma but i can't figure out why they bought the rights to this movie so boring i felt like i was watching for hours some where on the plot summary it says but what satan doesn't know stuck with annoying tourists well they didn't seem to bother him in the movie just only good thing about this movie is the actor who plays satan i like bad but it was just boring
a visit to the lodz ghetto in nazi-occupied poland recorded by a german cameramen with the naive co-operation of the jewish community is combined with archival footage clips from international newsreels and excerpts from related cultural films to portray the jews as swindlers and parasites this documentary interprets jewish life from the viewpoint of traditional anti-semitism and nazi ideology a candid cinematically-unique expression of racial hatred i personally find this film frightening and highly offensive one can only hope that such pictures as this will never reach the screen again
well the reason for seeing it in the cinema was that it was a sneak preview else i would never have seen this terrible teenage slasher movie i mean haven't we had enough of this yet scream and scary movie at least did not take them self serious the plot sucks and the acting is the worst i've seen godzilla can compare which is also the only movie that competes in being the worst i've seen in the cinema with this is so many plot holes in the story and the girls are so alike that you don't even now who has been killed and who has not you don't care the only of them i knew in advance was denise and she was the most talent less actress i have ever seen in this bad excuse for a as far away from this movie as possible
i am very open to foreign films and like to think that i grasp what they are trying to accomplish although some things are lost in translation but the simplicity and intelligence of this film were boring i've often thought how interesting it would be to make a movie that just shows a typical day or time period that really had no point now that i've seen a movie like that i will no longer be thinking along those lines tones about society racism and some south park has that and when i watch south park it actually moves me to feel an emotion the closest thing i felt to an emotion during this movie was the yawn i experienced after the first five minutes i rate the typical movie a seven or above because i love most every film i gave this film a one
warning don't even consider watching this film in any form not even worth downloading from the internet every bit of porn has more substance than this wasted piece of celluloid the so-called filmmakers apparently have absolutely no idea how to make a film they couldn't tell a good joke to save their lives an insult to any human being if you're looking for a fun-filled movie go look somewhere hope this mr unterwaldt jr being a good indication for his obvious inexperience and intellectual infancy dies a death and never makes a film fact even a waste of time to write anything about this crap why i'll stop right now and rather watch a good film
i've seen this film because i had do job includes seeing movies of all kinds i couldn't stop thinking who gave money to make such an awful film and also submit it to cannes festival it wasn't only boring the actors were awful as well it was one of the worst movies i've ever seen
no doubt frank sinatra was a talented actor as well as a talented singer after all very few actors nowadays can get a scene just right in one take and that was pretty much modus operandi on feel that as the wore on the quality of the films really started to tank the tony rome detective series was nothing short of trying to compete with dean matt helm series which came out at the same time perhaps even a james bond competition but nothing really worked for frank during these years his personal life in shambles his music fading appeared more like a throwback to the the last great sinatra film of this period was probably von express in
this movie was like a bad indie with a-list talent the plot was silly all the way to the end it reminded me very much of something churned out for the home video market in the i would have given it a one but there were brief moments when you could see the actors really really straining to make this worthwhile i think the worst thing was the underwater held off of the dock the underwater lighting seemed to come from no were and whenever someone we were supposed to care about was close to running out of air this air tank would kind of appear i would avoid this unless there is nothing else on the shelf good day
sadly it was misguided this movie stunk from start to finish it was hard to watch because i used to watch clarissa explains it all every day on nickelodeon i loved her then the next thing i found she did a spread in maxim and she was gorgeous i haven't really heard anything about her until i watched this movie on accident i couldn't believe she would even let something like this be seen with her name all over it everything about it was wrong but it still looked like someone somewhere in the team was trying really really hard to save a sunk ship too bad i hope she continues to act and i would love to see her with a real cast in a real movie
having enjoyed jean arthur in the devil and miss jones my interest was peaked so i tried sitting through this second-string screwball outing about an investigation into the death of a i didn't make it to the end arthur photographed in a gauzy movie-magazine fashion either wants alimony from ex-husband william powell or another shot at marriage but i never felt for her because the character is just a string of wisecracks the type of heroine prone to comical curiousness but once inside a all women in these faints william powell reportedly had a high time working with miss arthur but you'd never know it from the end result they look awkward standing next to each other hesitant over their banter the actor playing valet is excruciating and the pauses for viewer laughs are pregnant with unease
i usually try to construct reasonably well-argued critiques of films but i can not believe this got past the script stage the dialogue is appalling the acting very dodgy the accents just awful and the direction and pacing is scrappy at don't remember the last time i saw a film quite this bad joseph fiennes pretty as he is might just have killed his career as quickly as it island of doctor moreau was no worse than this garbage
snuggle down in your favourite chair and switch on the play-station as you toss this into the waste disposal unit spend a useful min living your favourite game disjointed poorly filmed non directed junk it takes a bits from several other science fiction movies and badly attempts to join the parts into a pathetically weak story nothing new here the filmmakers do not seem to realise that providing simple entertainment would achieve a monetary game but a touch of skill ingenuity and flair is required to turn it into a good film any money spent watching this is a waste and personally i would like my min of life back
who did the research for this film set in baghdad in however all the soldiers are wearing acus and have all universal camouflage pattern gear no one was wearing that stuff in just saw this film while deployed overseas and i can say that the overwhelming feeling from the audience was wtf this movie made no sense had characters come and go with no explanation and people doing ridiculous things that would never happen in real life i realize that a movie but obviously trying to portray something realistic it fails miserably but trying like someone came up with a bunch of random ideas chewed them up and swallowed then vomited out a film i would not recommend this film to anyone i'm still not sure why i sat through the whole thing gi joe was one that really made you think compared to this stay away
this movie delivers the best is when the awkward teenage neighbor tries to bike away from the babysitter and in the background looks like never been anywhere near a bike in his life as he attempts not to fall this movie doesn't stop there when less than minutes later it delivers a scene of nothing but an arm reaching through a fence and into a cooler pulling out a beer grilling dads several plot lines that go nowhere and a former seaquest actress with a bluetooth cell phone all add up to making this the perfect saturday night at home
i finally caught up to starlight last night on television and all i can say is wow hard to know where to begin the incredibly hokey special effects out the laser beams shooting out of eyes the atrocious acting the ponderous dialogue the mismatched use of stock footage or the air of earnest pretentiousness that infuses the entire production this truly is a one-of-a-kind experience and we should all be thankful for that i nominate jonathon kay as the true heir to ed wood
first off the lead brad dourif is a kook if you're trying to take this movie seriously then i guarantee going to ruin it for you if you don't take him too seriously then actually kind of fun to watch as with another reviewer i loved the scene where lisa bain and dourif are declaring their love for each other in between dodging the jets of flame shooting out of his arm in the car another great campy scene was watching john landis as a snotty radio show producer getting toasted and flailing around the room in fact i found the last minutes of the movie to be a non-stop laugh-riot i'm just not sure if tobe hooper meant it to be that way
i am quite sure that this was the worst movie ever made if you can't make a year old boy laugh at silly humor you should give up comedy forever unfortunately joan rivers chose differently the movie is full of predictable gags of these are racist and very unfunny jokes particularly memorable is the scene where the doctor tells the lead character that the rabbit has died and he is pregnant i write this i cannot believe this was actually a movie scene the man rushes to a dead rabbit on the doctors desk and tries to give it mouth to mouth rotflmao not the punch line that can tell you how bad things are in this movie is i knew i should have been on top ha ha ha ha ah ugh
few films have left me with such a feeling of unease and this is not a compliment since i saw it in a theater it ended there i can only wonder i was subjected to mn of hateful derivative garbage the main impression being a bit like this other sick-o movie don't answer the phone but worse the nastiness of it all rape and all is shown without any distance strong stuff like last house on the left and utter contempt for the victims and everybody involved leaving the viewer to be treated as a sadistic voyeur at the end i felt like taking a shower no credits to the director
okay so i get it we're supposed to be horrified the idea has been planted a girl is doing her dad and taking photos of it call me over the shock-rock genre but i call for the explicit detailing of an act before i can fall for this but don't expect me to watch a soft-porn and become horrified that she is doing her mean hasn't that convention become a bit abused in the adult film industry already infiltrated with rape and molestation isn't what your mind can fool you into believing it is what actually exists in film this is where miike fails in visitor q extremism becomes mild when it becomes a choose your own adventure
this film is not funny it is not entertaining it does not contain one single second of originality or intelligence nor does it lead you to take the slightest interest in the characters or situation added to that about as juvenile a movie as anything in recent memory as if a group of or year old high school kids who had never actually met or had any type of relationship with a real girl had sat down and wrote a movie based on their incorrect fantasies about what being an adult man would be like this movie is boring obnoxiously mind-numbing and at times offensive and disgusting at most it contains one or two moments that make you laugh also it seems twice as long as its minute running time
this became a cult movie in chinese college students though i havnt watched it until it is broadcasted in of arty giddy pretentions the plot is mediocre and unreal the spirit it wants to convey is how independent artists resist the commercisliation of music industry and maintain their purity of an artistic soul and wouldnt sell themselves for dirty money that is really giddy and superficial the diologue are mainly pathetic acting is poor sceenplay is full of art pretention it is a fantasy movie for kids and
as with many other pop-culture franchise series this line just didn't know when to quit instead of leaving things as they were perfectly ended they went on to generate this the first installment of this franchise to fall sorely short of the movie should never have happened it was not intended for there to have been a fourth movie in this line and it sure shows the premise is idiotic and the portrayals were the the wonderful experience which was the omen this was a major disappointment which stank of cheese and horrible acting it was reminiscent of the amityville horror in those aspects and left a terrible lingering stench long after it was over rates a fiend
i watched mask in the and currently showing on fox kids in the uk late at night i remember thinking that it was kinda cool back in the day and had a couple of the toys too but watching it now bores me to tears i never realised before of how tedious and bland this cartoon show really was just plain awful it is no where near in the same league as the transformers he-man or thundercats and was very quickly forgot by nearly everyone once it stopped being made i only watch it on fox kids because ulysses comes on straight after it if mask doesn't put me to sleep first one of the lesser cartoons that i hope to completely forget about again once it finishes airing on fox kids
not sure why this movie seems to have gotten such rave watching bang one night on tv i found myself bored by the nonsensical random plot which was occurring on screen the entire movie seems to be nothing more than an exercise in meaningless artsy-fartsy self-indulgence on the part of the filmmaker the fact that the goes by a one name moniker only reinforces this sense of pretentiousness interested in indie flicks would be better off looking for something better written and dare i say more entertaining than this complete waste of time
i sat through this at gencon only because it was quiet and i could nap what a waste of time beverly d'angelo and william katt wtf were the lady who played flo and abe vigoda busy or a piece of unfunny garbage the characters were stereotypical without meaning to think and wooden most of them seemed like they were on autopilot the so-called hilarious situations described in some of the other so-called reviews were so hackneyed i weeped for the confused as to how anyone can find this worth their time seriously i'm only giving it out of because in order to be a or it would need to be either five-hours long or feature more kelly lebrock
the scenery is pretty and the dog is cute other than that this film has absolutely nothing to recommend it jack warden is pleasantly genial as usual but the script is so awful that even he comes off badly the plot makes no sense the dialogue is dumb and there are numerous smaller faults but the dog is cute
turkish cinema has a big problem directors aren't interested in global cinema they are local and folkloric but want to be international this brings kitsch results such this has jokes translated to spanish from turkish and they don't have any meaning for non-turkish audiences even for turkish audiences after even ferhan sensoy have a worse acting than average they act like was shot in cuba but nothing includes about cuba so cuba is thought like a banana of money waste of time
the motion picture was in all likelihood made in the year and released in i would surmise that talking motion pictures had great difficulty in making the transition from the silent era nevertheless this particular zane grey plot appears to be very weak also gary cooper was probably just learning to act the result is something that would not be acceptable by standards for maybe for not acceptable some of the actors performed well sadly the indians always get the short end in these early westerns they were living on the land long before the white man came but according to twisted history they had no right to defend themselves
ulises is a literature teacher that arrives to a coastal town there he will fell in love to martina the most beautiful girl in town they will start a torrid romance which will end in the tragic death of ulises at the sea some years later martina has married to sierra the richest man in town and lives a quiet happy live surrounded by money one day the apparition of ulises will make her passion to rise up and act without thinking the consequences the plot is quite absurd and none of the actors plays a decent part in addition three quarters of the film are sexual acts which still being well filmed are quite tiring as we want to see more development of the story it is just a bad bigas film with lots of sex no argument and stupid characters everywhere
where to start i feel violated thats right violated i just spent of my life that i could have spent doing something more useful like watching paint dry on this so called horror not scary its not funny its not dramatic its no action its predictable its boring its might come of a bit harsh here but watch this movie and you will feel the same way or no don't watch you want to feel violated also
i could not for the life of me follow figure out or understand the story as the plot advances it too stays incomprehensible i'm going to guess and say that there was a preproduction problem that never got sorted out the producers could never separate the many details that the novel or any novel has the time and space to create from the other idea which was to make a movie about a serial killer and the pursuit by the police they ended up with too many things happening in a proscribed feature film time limit too bad really because they had a solid cast a director who knows how to move things around and excellent cinematography in fact a well made movie that one could enjoy and relax with for a couple of hours
interesting at first a naive park ranger firth marries a pretty mysterious woman zane only known for a short time they seem to be happy then she disappears without warning he searches for her and after a few dead ends stumbles upon some of her abused childhood and sleazy recent past which may include criminal activity and then it seems the filmmakers didn't know what to do with the story the beginning while not as suspenseful as it sounds is at least watchable then it ceases to be interesting or even make much sense and the ending is so lame so dull and so devoid of any excitement or intelligence you'll think the screenwriters didn't know what to do with it and got bored trying what a sorry waste of a good idea
wow i didn't know that someone would make this movie its awful i have written down things that can tell why u do not want to see this its the biggest rave ever where is the that rave i could only see a few people dancing around when they are on the can only see blood ruined tents and one stage and what do they do they worst actors i have ever seen the captain and his crew awful when one of the people is firing an ordinary gun he shoots almost times without reloading i didn't knew every person in the world could fight as a pro must be a new wonder what the producer was thinking this is going to be a big hit its gonna be a classic sure u dumb anyway don't see this movie its a waist of time my eyes are still bleeding
usually i support independent art and i try to be very comprehensive and tend to support everybody because their efforts are this movie just moves away from all comprehension and tolerance the following think about the really worst horror movie you have ever seen in your life so think about some great attractive art for that dvd a promising voil√† you got zombie it only if you really don't have anything else better to do anything is better
whipped is minutes long this review is words long three unlikable new york lotharios ruthless scammers end up wooing the same woman played by amanda peet with disastrous results that applies to the story and the film too sophomoric to be misogynistic flaccid and ridiculous whipped mixes the philosophies of shock jock tom lykis with penthouse letter fantasies though technically proficient dated grating poorly written mean and obvious people don't act like this people don't talk like this really
steven seagal appears to be sleepwalking through a dreadful movie shot almost entirely in close-up to disguise the complete lack of budget and resources to pick on the technical flaws silver and take of from a carrier for an air-strike and miraculously become camouflaged for the actual strike would give this movie more credibility than it deserves suffice it to say that the most interesting thing in the movie is the credit titles which fade on and then disappear in a lightning wipe which presumably is available to all users of final cut pro putting all your creativity into your own credit puts michael keusch in the same category as marcel mandu
i tried to watch this movie in a military camp during an overseas mission and let me tell you you'll watch anything under those circumstances not this piece of first five minutes set the tone by weak porn-movie quality acting weird out-of-the-blue plot twists and unbelievable situations and behavior it gets worse after that this movie does not have one single saving grace and yet it is not bad in a way that would make it funny to watch just horrible i've seen quite many movies in my life and i'm not one of those snobby know-all critics i mean i'll enjoy most movies to some extent even if they're bad this one clear of this one my friend
i've never been to paris but after seeing paris je t'aime i'm crazy to visit this city i've been to ny several times and i love the city and its boroughs i kinda expected to be touched by this film to feel like jumping into a plane and fly there right away but lo and behold i regret the time and money i spent with it there are no love stories between people or a person and the city a lot of dysfunctional meetings and relations or people who know each other and it just doesn't work out fine maybe this reflects a characteristic of the city where said to have thousands of people living on their own can't you find love in new york
the thing about calling house of the dead the worst movie of all time is that really not there are worse movies out there i watch alot of hong kong ninja movies that are basically the result of an unfinished japanese police drama having footage of ninjas inserted at the end to create something that could technically be called a of the dead is however one of the worst films i've ever seen at the theatres walking out half way through i actually felt i was somewhat dumber for having set through minutes of this piece of garbage
i gave this movie a rating of the only reason that it should even get a instead of a big is ben kingsley who always shines not matter what terrible material is thrown his sorvino is so out of her element here that as a viewer one simply can't get over the fact that she is even in such a stupid story and horrible production do not waste your video rental
mr vanhook took a good idea and kicked like a football unfortunately it didn't make the goal the historical subject of giants is a good one but pour in the goon milk and you end up with a giant wheel of cheese i say take this reel wheel and roll it off a cliff i couldn't even watch the entire film that says a lot because i rarely walk away from any movie i always like to give them a chance for last-minute redemption impossible to redeem something this bad well at least the acting was only thing falling in this film is the rating and sinking into the negative numbers
gloria victor and dolores reed in space girl love sci fi i even love cheesy sci fi but this film is really really bad and not in a kinda unwatchable as a couple of bozos do their best hip cat impression of abott can usually save cheesy sci fi such as in cat women on the moon but it can't in this case this film requires a mute button and fast forward said i could watch gloria and dolores walk around the space ship for about an hour or so
there are bad movies then there are the movies that are so bad that they become almost art this is one of those films my partner and i are still both kind of shell shocked you know staring off into space and drooling you can tell that the people involved hope they changed their names to protect themselves were having a blast and they definitely weren't shy i give this one a three out of ten just because of the gratuitous smut and really bad gore effects i laughed out loud during most of the movie so i guess you could say that it showed me a good time beware viewer the above words in no way construe that this is a good film because it is not all i can say in my defense is that it was impossible to pass up a movie with such a great title
jason alexander is a wonderful actor but ridiculous to cast him as a cuddly romantic lead the fact that he dances so well croons so effectively and throws himself into the part so completely somehow just made him seem all the more creepy in his more cutesy moments the girl in the train station in the final number with rosie i couldn't take my eyes off him he was so repellent you keep expecting him to drop the nice-guy act and start snarling vanessa williams was the real star the only performance that was better than the movie by the way if you see a production of the stage musical the movie and this movie you'll see three versions that have more revisions songs same songs assigned to different characters and in different situations than any other musical i've ever seen
deadly beauty and lethal kicks make the movie cooler than it'd be story is so poor and character dies in such a foolish way that you wonder if the ending they had thought of for this movie i wish somebody could tell that an alternative ending exists but i fear it doesn't as for the rest of the cst well i'd say they simply didn't act very well although the blame should be put on the poor movie reminds me of rush hour where zhang ziyi dies in absurd way since she had been the only one who had stolen the show during the whole movie i could give this movie
what a terrible film it sucked it was terrible i don't know what to say about this film but dinocrap which i stole from some reviewer with a nail up his ass ahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahah sigh not roger corman that i hate this god-awful movie well really but what can you expect from a movie with homoeric computer graphics which is another thing the cgi sucked out loud i hate this movie dreadfully this is without a doubt the worst roger corman b-movie and probably the gayest b-movie too dinocrap i'm sorry i must have offended some nerds in these moments just an awful movie
i am never a big fan of taiwan movie production as opposed to korean hongkong or even china strong acting quality is hardly found in them as clearly shown in this film i don't consider myself as hard-to-please audience as i am in fact a fan of indie movies however this movie shows weak plot and slow pace i found myself lost in the middle as to where the plot is going the acting certainly does not make it better acting is sub par as she over-act trying to be perky and cute although i have to admit she is a pleasure to look at isabella leong on the other hand plays a more suitable role as a confused sad regretful extremely reserved character overall i find this movie is a disappointment
man even plan from outer space is better than this movie this flick doesn't have enough plot for half an hour yet they managed to extend it for an eternity of more than an hour jet li and corey yuen are pretty good specially in those exaggerated fight scenes but stuff like the legend of fong sai yuk is much better than this sorry thing that would be better left unmade
despite unfortunately thinking itself to be intelligent important and interesting fortunately this movie is over mercifully quickly the script makes little sense the whole idea of the sado-masochistic relationship between the two main characters is strangely trite and john lydon shows us all in the space of one movie why he should never have let himself out of music his performance is one-note and only positive thing to be said is that harvey keitel manages to deliver a good turn his later bad lieutenant would show just how badly good actors can act but mercifully his performance here is restrained
ok i have read about this film somewhere in the internet and many criticized on how bad and sucks this film was and i couldn't have been more agree about it then after that i saw this film on dvd i was thinking twice about this and then came commercial of this film on tv luckily i spared my money for this pieces of crap i was sacrificed my sleeps for this film and soon it turned out that this film couldn't make me satisfy so i can't be judging on how the film was made but anyway it still sucks as for those who liked this film i would apologize for flaming this film and telling on how sucks this film is i don't know what do you think about this film
this relic of a short film starts with a teen going through the process of attempting to get a license it quickly becomes sidetracked with just about every imaginable topic relating to things as dune buggies drag racing custom paint jobs and car shows are discussed it often attempts to be humorous but instead the film is dull drawn out and even sexist at times none of the people in the film are actually heard instead everything is done in narration and voiceovers sorry but i can't stand is nothing educational or interesting about dad can i borrow the car just another piece of mindless filler to take up time on their wonderful world of disney tv show
children love dinosaurs somewhat part of their culture but they've got the land before time the original at least that movie had heart this this movie is just plain pathetic just because kids love dinosaurs doesn't mean you can just slap together any old story and show it to the children this movie has no plot the whole premise is stupid and more by the numbers stuff not as soul sucking as theodore rex but lightyears away from being a land before time
this isn't cinema it isn't talent it isn't informative it isn't scary it isn't entertaining it isn't anything at got this because my cousin says diablo cool yeah right the only thing cool about this experience was the lone fact that i didn't buy it but rented it shot like a bad soap opera no wait soap operas at least look this this looks like it was shot with camcorder horrid wretched it cinematography is detestable who is this director anyway i don't even care enough to look him up he stinks the performances by these poor unsuspecting actors were far better than this crap-fest on the b scale registers about a on the a scale fiend
boring minimal plot no character development i went into this movie with high expectations from the book it could have been an awesome movie it could have probably become a cult classic nope it was a giant let-down it was poorly cast and had horrible special effects it was difficult to determine who were the bad guys the rebels or the military or the church or all of them i am still left puzzled by certain mini-plots from the movie i am left dumbfounded as to certain aspects of this so-called prophecy which is never really fully explained i felt like i was watching a corny episode of a mini-series on the sci-fi channel it seemed very much like a made-for-tv movie don't go see this movie it is a waste of time and money
don't see this movie bad acting and stupid gore effects a complete waste of time i was hoping to see a lot of cool murders and hot the director depended on animal slaughter videos to shock you the watcher disgusting the murders are pretty lame basically strangulation one woman he stuffs worms in her mouth one he puts raw hamburgers on her face and strangles her btk btk broiler burger killer new ha i don't think this movie relied too much on actual facts i mean he real btk killer didn't carry around a bunch of rodents scorpions and oh slaughtered cow head too go figure
doc savage the man of bronze is a horrible movie poorly scripted over-acted and just plain silly that being said it is actually an enjoyable movie on some level this movie begs to be watched in a group with an ample supply of cheap beer one of those movies like santa claus conquers the martians or yor the hunter from the future so bad it is almost good if you have the right group of people this movie is a blast to watch campy fun it has a theme by sousa if you're looking for a good movie though look elsewhere i've heard rumors some studio is exploring the possibility of a remake
i mistakenly kept myself awake late last night watching this thing about the only thing i could say good about this horrid film is that it could be used by film schools to show how not to make a movie no proper character development wait i'm not even sure they were characters set-ups were hokey and inane and the overuse of split screens was wasted since sometimes they couldn't even synchronize with alternate shots if i could give this a zero or minus rating i would sadly it isn't even worth the time for a few just a sad example of money wasted by hollywood and now i waste my time even thinking about it
this movie sucked plain and simple okay so basically about a girl that gets raped and to get revenge she gets another guy to rape the rapist the rapist is a douche but the girl victim is partly to blame i mean they both get in the mood and start kissing and stuff but when the rapist tries to have sex with her she doesn't allow it so the rapist rapes her and the thing is the rape scene for the girl is very short and it doesn't really expose or show anything but when it comes to the rapist getting raped a pretty long rape scene there is basically nothing in the story that is worth
relative to other columbo movies this can only be rated a i seriously do not understand what the other reviewers have seen in this appalling train-crash of a film it was only through morbid fascination that i continued to watch it to see what bizarre or inept decision the director would make reviewer suggested that it was only directorial outing because it interfered with his acting role in fact i think the real reason lies with the studio bosses who must have been horrified when they saw what he had done with their money a wonder they didn't murder him
i was at this premiere at the toronto film festival in after the screening when the and some cast members offered to answer questions no one could even be bothered to ask any rarely has a film been so poorly directed on earth were random frames snipped out of some scenes wretchedly acted arquette to paraphrase dorothy parker does not run the emotional gamut from a to b he parks at a and brings a lunch and utterly pointless characters behave completely out of character for no reason except to force the plot to move in certain directions at long last the film comes to a completely random and pointless end supposed to really make you think unfortunately what it makes you think is well minutes of my life i'm never getting back
this is one of the worst film adaptations of a musical ever made the stage version of a chorus line is wonderful this movie misses the mark in almost every way even the casting is baffling take audrey landers as val dance looks is song story is that she is a great dancer but a in the looks department yes she finds a solution but ultimately a great dancer what do the brilliant filmmakers do they hire an actress who can't dance and is famous for looking great way to miss the the choreography i'm sure michael bennett was turning over in his grave why didn't they use his choreography it really can't be improved upon
because of the writers guild of america strike they had to shoot this episode in days pretty much crap consisting of repeat cut pasted clips from season and was described by its writer maurice hurley as terrible just terrible the producers couldn't just wait to shoot something decent who knows i'm guessing because of the strike the production ran out of money and could only release a flashback episode or maybe roddenberry was too sick at the time to be able to veto this half-assery this episode also marks the final appearance of diana muldaur katherine pulaski on the series
i hired this movie expecting a few laughs hopefully enough to keep me amused but i was sorely mistaken this movie showed very minimal moments of humour and the pathetic jokes had me cringing with shame for ever hiring it aimed at an age group of this movie will certainly leave viewers outside of these boundaries feeling very unsatisfied worth no more than votes highly unrecommended for anyone not wanting to waste hours of their lives
i am a huge fan of warrior movies some of my favorites are braveheart troy the last samurai and gladiator and after watching mongol which is absolutely awesome and which i strongly recommend i had high expectations from a sergei bodrov movie but it was terrible awful even pathetic is not a strong word in this case the whole movie i was waiting for something exciting to happen but it didn't then i was at least expecting a big epic battle at the end but even that was a huge disappointment just some random running around waving with the swords there are so many good warrior movies this one is not one of them
first off i'd like to point out that sam niel is nowhere to be seen in this film a movie without sam niel did anyone see event horizon d-wars did have potential a movie about a dragon that controls lizards with rocket launchers does sound cool but sadly isn't nope no sam niel no good movie i recommend taking the dollars or so it takes to rent d-wars and adding to that five and buying a sam niel apparently to submit this i have to have ten lines of text so heres a list of sam niel movies i park calm for red october horizon jurassic park d-wars is a pile
the movie is an extra-long tale of a classic novel that completely fails to capture the original spirit the quite horribly american patrick swayze is cast as the british hero allan quatermain despite the obviousness of his movie continues throughout to hollywood-ise the story by changing both the plot and the characters to fit more comfortably into the accepted mold the movie manages to be predictable throughout even to those who are not familiar with the story and is plagued by some extremely bad acting and terribly disappointing fight in all a terrible addition to the already quite bad collection of movies based on the legend of king mines and allan quatermain
a short review at all costs a thorough waste of at the end of the film i was none the wiser as to what had actually happened full of cameos fry jack dee secs the philadelphia girls and some vaguely recognisable people but it just doesn't make any sense whether the story just got lost in the edit i don't now but on a dvd instead or go to bed and get some out of the cameos and a morris minor car
this is a bad bad movie i'm an actual fencer trust me when i say that this pretension of accuracy is just that this is especially true during that vile little scene when the fencers are combining footwork with pop the ending is predictable and the movie is a bore from start to finish horrible
predictable parody just about failed to impress throughout looooooong eight minutes the only thing that made it worthwhile was the do not colorize line at the end credits shame something more entertaining wasn't put on the dvd like jonathan ross enjoyable profile of romero on the incredible strange film show
del you are the dumbest smart person i've ever had a brain but they lost it in the think what i find most egregious about this bastardization of work was how the character of susan calvin was portrayed in the books she was actually one of the first strong female protagonists able to think her way through a problem here just a damsel in distress waiting to be rescued by wil are passing references to laws of robotics but they are an afterthought to the cgi and action is likable as he is in most of his films but honestly the story isn't that good you figure it out long before these genius characters do
i rented this movie roughly years ago and was instantly wanted to see a b-movie slasher flick but ended up with a fecal matter for my eyes the acting was similar to watching grass dry i've seen better acting in a softcore idea that a crazy killer comes out of nowhere baffled me how was this a horror production value was laughable at best there were no scares it seemed like a high school student got a new video camera for christmas the plot was all over the place if existent if you are bored looking for a bad horror movie to rent skip this one there are much better b-movies out there
after watching this i thought to myself there are either too few good writers directors or lots of any rate this is a terrible movie terrible in a way that not fun but rather makes you grit your teeth and quiver makes you shout this is wrong at the movie immersion is zero by now most of you are probably used to the terrible in movies that has computers hackers etc in them this movie is like that in every aspect only good thing about the movie is the little girl emily brilliantly played by eliza bennett i hope she becomes big and make this thing at least worth yourself a favor don't watch this there is not even proper action in it total waste of time
film starts with people meeting each other in the bar ok they're talking about their imaginary lives lying all the time with no reason still time to time they even make you laugh interesting first minutes you actually enjoy it but become a long then when something happen all you can see are naked old ladies touching each other not ok disgusting by the way this part should be the top of the movie but everything except that movie has no boring and sick strangest thing is that serbia on fest festival this movie was the most popular according to researches of course before people watched it i even watching hay this might be interesting although a russian movie but god no
this movie wasn't just bad it was terrible after i watched it i actually felt the need to take a shower to get the filth off of me there is running gag with an elderly couple making out it is not funny but it is disgusting the monster make up was cool but that is all the continuity errors alone will have you angry at least i was the editing is really anything else you could possibly do would be better than spending time watching this movie even if your group of friends are into bad movies this one is exceptional in its ineptitude i couldn't even bring myself to laugh at it you have been warned
this was a watchable movie but plot was a little weak and most of the jokes were from some of earlier movies with that said it was worth the time to watch i gave this a out of so basically its one of those movies that you do not go out of your way to see but if you find it on the tube take a chance
if you've ever seen this movie you'd know that it if you haven't and want to see a classic bad movie i suggest you see this movie because it ranks right down with the worst so if you're really bored go rent it if you want to know what like my little summary adam sandler is hired to work on a giant cruise ship with some ms universe models and five other people adam doesn't like how one passenger is getting all the babes and he tries to take over with the cheezy jokes but wait it only gets worse you'll have to rent the movie yourself to see how bad it truly is
i was fascinated as to how truly bad this movie was was the viewer supposed to learn something or reflect on anything here what was up with the pumpkins was i supposed to be impressed with the motel shots does it matter that there are some garbage bags on a rooftop across the street of a hotel why does the narrator unsuccessfully mock the people he interviews is so obvious that he edited out the really informative parts of his interviews to achieve mockery the best part of the movie was the interview with the film professor who tells us how bad this movie will be even before it is am truly amazed i believe that the creator is struggling to become an intellectual or is trying to impress the intellectual community
this is the absolute worst movie i have ever seen there was absolutely nothing good to say about this movie i have seen some bad movies but this one takes it there is no plot and most of the movie you are either fast forwarding the movie to get it done faster or you are wondering what the hell is going on because you can't seriously think that someone thought of this movie and you are watching it i feel sorry for anyone who has to sit through this painful hour and a half please take my advice and do not watch this movie for i know you will think it is the biggest waste of time you have ever spent in your life
i went into this movie thinking that it would be a neat football drama the same vein as remember the titans however i came away feeling like i had just attended a ted haggard sermon about the rapture the only thing that was missing was the request for a tithe at the end of the movie actually one would probably get more out of a televangelist sermon than this poor excuse for entertainment at least with the televangelist sermon there are quotes from the scripture rather than quotes from popularist self-help pulp the plot was entirely too predictable to the point that anyone with a long-enough attention span could have laid out the entire plot within the first minutes of the movie
this thing is horrible the ben affleck character is self-centered and gleefully fratboy sadistic and the romantic hero his cartoonish character does not change from beginning to end but his money ultimately allows him to buy i were a socialist i would screed beyond belief but i'm not a capitalists like a little christmas magic from time to time this ain't magic i don't know what it is just awful and a horrible waste of talent o'hara has been making me laugh hysterically since the late gandolfini applegate these people were all underused if ben was out of the equation these folks might have dreamed up something excellent
i can't really say what i think about this movie its against the guidelines i've watched many many films and this has got to be the worst one yet extremely low budget i'm guessing all the money went into the slaughter house scenes cause i could of did a better job with a camera and a crew of monkeys it was so bad i registered just to leave a comment cause i had to tell someone movie rental place wasn't enough but this is my cents worth i suggest borrowing it from some poor sap who rented it and watch it yourself cause i sure wouldn't waste the money on it myself again now i leave you with this comment i hope your not made at the rental place when they wont refund you your money
the worst movie i have seen in a while yeah its fun to fantasize but if that is what you are looking for i suggest you see brewsters millions this was just terrible and corny and terrible at being corny unless you are five or like terrible movies don't see this one
i am not weapon expert but even i can see difference between army riffles in wwi and wwii in movie we can see privates armed with garand in year not authentic springfield silent death who privates use until wwii difference can load times more ammunition and times more fire rate was semi automatic springfield requires reloading after every shot little difference german army uniforms has borrowed from year too especially helmets german helmets until end of wwi have significant pike on top we cannot see even one in movie and if we make little additional search in archives how much truthful is this true story i am surprised how much truthful can be film directors in a pursuit of cheap propagation
it begins on a nice note only to falter quickly and let down kumar and abraham characters are not properly built before boss decides to hitch him with three air hostess rest of the drama is about how mac sam and uncle mambo rawal deal with situations which at times seem the cast paresh rawal is a very talented actor i thought was wasted in the role of a moody cook akshay kumar is tolerable john abraham is very bad keeps stumbling over furniture rajpal yadav is the only saving grace in the movie second half of the movie is funny at times but in all a dud are boring and a major let down if you are hoping for some wholesome entertainment and comedy
some fraud girl tries to compete in the big leagues of motorcross by swiching places with her brother she gets to the top by lying and manipulation she should have been disqualified the movie promotes lying and cheating to win also the idea of a yr old mechanic is absurd it takes many many years to get good go back to the tonka toys
well you know the rest this has to be the worst movie i've seen in a long long time i can only imagine that stephanie beaham had some bills to pay when taking on this lead role is played by me a complete unknown and i would imagine disappeared right back into obscurity right after this lee led the martial arts charge in the early and since then fight scenes have to be either martial arts based or at least brutal if using street fighting techniques this movie uses fast cuts to show off the martial arts however even this can't disguise the fact that the lady doesn't know how to throw a punch an average year old boy would take her apart on this the only mystery on show here is how this didn't win the golden raspberry for its year
even steve martin and dan aykroyd couldn't save this movie from laying an emu-sized egg based on the classic phil silvers tv series it bombed because a it was updated to the and b the simple premise of the tv series was turned into a confusing feeble and silly original tv series used a small cast of talented actors to portray lovable characters acting out simple yet hilarious pranks to expand this premise into a movie was asking for trouble and it shows no one could pay me enough to sit through this stinker a second time
lois weber self proclaimed missionary via the cinema wrote directed and produced other films on controversial subjects but this may be the first to get wide viewing thanks to tcm this film is her indictment of abortion but she cleverly muddles the issue by bringing in eugenics and birth control leaving the impression that they are somehow equivalent to abortion her talent in writing and the other cinematic skills are well displayed here but one may be forgiven for wishing she had used them less didactically if you have wondered what tyrone power famous father looked like here is your chance fashions and automobiles are also on display to add to the interest of this museum piece enjoyable even if you don't appreciate the propaganda
this may very well be the worst movie i'll see if i live to be i think a group of first-graders could have come up with better plot lines as a class project than this i'm dumber for having watched it and god have mercy on the souls who were paid to produce this after i finally turned it off i actually had the urge to one had a clue about photography when made this no one had a clue about acting no one had a clue about just about can't believe shows this crap on occasion the only time i had seen it was on one of the starz channels not even the main one and it was on at about at that
corridors of time the movie you can watch if you're looking for a sophisticated way of suicide some use guns ropes or gas but you want to ruin your brains do not wait any longer corridors of time is probably one of the biggest possible mistakes thinking christian clavier is able to act and to bring you fun i do not miss the francs this poor thing cost me sometimes one has to reset its evaluation system looking at the absolute zero this film deserves a but only because i like jean reno too bad for him he also stars in ronin i think i'm gonna dislike him
i have seen bad movies before but this one takes the worst movie of a lifetime award by far anthony hopkins has to be completely mentally ill to have his name attached to this one anywhere i will never see another movie with him in it directing it etc etc i can't believe the other actors actresses that i liked this picture that stooped so low to be a part of this disaster there must be some great drugs out there for anyone to not be embarrassed to be a part of such a film is beyond me save your money on this one huge flop from beginning to end shame on you mr hopkins also shame on christian slater i can't believe you put your reputations on the line for this one
this movie was rented it not knowing what to watched the minutes and the movie and knew it was a acting was bad and there was no monster is soooooo growls and its mouth doesnt why would they have a doctor playing a xylophone to kill the plain bad don't even waste your out of
i actually saw this movie in the theater back in original release it was painful to watch peter sellers embarrass himself so badly the story was incredibly lame and difficult to follow and the ending was ridiculous it was just sad to see how the mighty had fallen i won't say that i'm a huge peter sellers fan but i did thoroughly enjoy the pink panther series and i felt that he gave a strong performance in being there but this film should never have been made from what i've read he pursued producing this film against the advice of the people around him fine but that still doesn't excuse the studio actually releasing the film
i thought that the nadir of horror film making had been reached with book of shadows i was wrong this film makes that look like the magnficiant ambersons compared to this piece of shameless unexpurgated fecal matter that has the audacity to call itself a movie i'd write more but i'm still to angry that i was idiot enough to spend renting it were these people english and where is the i have lived in the uk two thirds of my life and as far as i know there are no dark uncharted woodlands in the midlands the whole bally thing looked like a national trust conifer plantation those angels looked like anorexic pornstars most of them were did my research i did however like the bit when judd got ripped in i love and admire tom savini but he cannot act
whatever possessed guy ritchie to remake film is new film is a mess there was one other person in the audience when i saw it and she left about an hour into it hope she demanded a refund the only reason i stayed through to the end was because i've never walked out of a i sat through this piece of junk thoroughly flabbergasted that madonna and ritchie could actually think they made a good film the dialogue is laughable the acting is atrocious and the only nice thing in this film is the scenery ritchie took movie and turned it into another blue is a film that you wouldn't even waste time watching late night on cinemax time is too precious to be wasted on crap like this
a the correct date j arthur rank production with james robertson justice margaret rutherford wilfred hyde white it has to be a smash comedy right oh just awful a one gag film watching people be shocked at the sight of a little alligator music is thrown in most inappropriately and forgettably jeannie carson is a lively dancer and competent singer but what was she doing in this film diana dors is here too providing oh-so-daring shots for use in the previews her acting level is not bad but in the film to provide someone to leer at well one must do something beside groan during this film the movie is being sold on vhs now by people on e-bay spare yourself the expense and the waste of time a comedy without a laugh a musical without a memorable song or dance
what is this a low budget sex comedy anyway it describes perfectly the people in spain they could come up with a better idea i mean they do this kind of movies since the and people like them this is neither a teen comedy nor a family one can't let your year old watch guys in bed kissing he'll never want to go to spain this should be rated r because only people seem to laugh watching s i'm truly disappointed maybe i don't like gays is quite an important part of the humor is awful in films kusturica stick with doing dramas if you want a new comedy try talladega nights
documentary about nomadic persians making a treacherous traverse of massive mountains to get their herds to grass watching this silent black and white feature marred in part by a twink-twink-twink oriental music score that could not have been used in the original exhibition is even duller than it sounds the spectacular scenery is lost on a small black and white screen and there is an utter failure to establish any kind of plot line i loved nanook of the north and march of the penguins but despised this movie notwithstanding the similarity of the theme physical hardships alone are just not that interesting
some illegal so-called asylum seeker comes to stuttgart and finds that germans are racist is just another already-forgotten steaming nugget in a long list of post-wwii anti-german propaganda films aimed to make germans feel bad for not welcoming each and every degenerate in their country so he can chase german blonds and sell drugs to german you're looking for good german films in general see der tunnel der untergang europa europa and lola not das experiment with the same male actor from lola rennt
i have nothing to comment on this movie it is so bad that i had to put my first comment on imdb website to help some viewers save some time and do something more interesting instead of watching this movie anything will do even stare at the walls is because i have to write minimum lines of text i tell you also is a low budget movie bad acting no name actors a stupid mutt as the wolf and so on also the story brings nothing new the special effects are made in the movie is almost as bad as the movie have fun watching this movie
awful absolutely awful no plot no point no end it looks like the director turned the camera on and then the whole crew went to lunch every day i'm trying to give this video away but no one will take it i'm giving it a instead of a because i like benigni roger i'm going to have to say thumbs down on this
there is no suspense in this serial when one episode ends the acting is so shoddy the effects are so poor and the script is so awful that the last thing on your mind is how batman and robin will save the day no in fact the last thing on your mind is watching the next episode this show is so boring that i can't see how it ever got made let alone released on dvd obviously the effects are not up to par with contemporary batman films but even the script is awful an incoherent babbling mess about some evil professor and a ray gun or something like that i am not quite sure because it is too awful to follow watch the version or the versions or even batman begins just anything over this version
this is possibly the most boring movie in history i was really looking forward to seeing this movie given the roman polanski i think i would rather see the three amigos than ever watch this movie again it promptly went from the dvd player straight into the garbage my apologies to those of you who apparently liked this movie however you probably liked new coke as well i am at a loss to see why anyone would have enjoyed this movie it is slow dull and has no real plot you wait for minutes for the movie to get started i understand this was made in however this was an era of bad television all around thank god disco and company are gone along with stop sign glasses and the bay city rollers oh well just my thoughts
i went into this movie expecting it to be really god-awful and it was i really felt sorry for the star-studded kathy bates was a wonderful actress before she made this vince vaughn and paul giamatti were disappointing as usual but miranda richardson couldn't put in one of the fabulous performances i know and love her for dad played by trevor peacock vicar of dibley fame amongst others had about one plot was predictable and all over the place and the humour was lacking there was one part of the movie where santa enters the house of a jewish family that made me laugh just because their expressions were classic don't see this movie unless your only other alternative is having a head-on collision with a train maybe the train would be better
i decided to watch this one because been nominated for oscar this year i guess as many folks here i really wanted to like this movie but ended up bored and disappointed first scene was ok but the whole rest of the movie in shaky hands camera mode is really guess the main reason for making such a movie and nominating it for oscar is military machine who makes money on war urgently need an excuse or justification of war in iraq by bungling up something of these heroic efforts of director and the main character to the audience with an idea of loving-war-like-a-drug oh please come on what a bore this to get an idea of how low the movie academy can fall
mario van peebles pops up for less than a five second cameo glenn plummer shows up a little longer but its a ladies show all the way stacey dash and lisa raye have been in better projects bobby brown leers and mugs through his little time on screen this is how it was tough women shootin and lovin in the wild wild west four black and one asian oh and lil kim is a tough talking heartbreaker and marie matiko can bring in the pacific rim market we can shoot it for less than million straight to video and we'll double but more likely triple our that got it boss
the youthful group in st fire who just graduated from college barely seem able to make it through high school much less four years at any prominent university for the most part these kids are irresponsible selfish greedy and stupid yet co-writer and director joel schumacher appears to hold them up as touchstones for a generation with a now-outdated cast of up and comers a background score that sounds awfully similar to that of terms of endearment and writing which lords the smugness of this circle over us fire is a paltry blaze one that gets even more embarrassing as the years pass on from
a collection of deleted scenes and alternative takes edited together and with added voice-over to make it appear to take place after the events of the first pretty cool idea but deleted scenes are left on the cutting room floor for a reason and this is further proof as just not as funny as anchorman and really face it that film wasn't exactly comedy gold either so you get a movie worse than one that was moderately funny in my eyes that still puts it one or two notches above kicking and screaming or bewitched chross your fingers that the wedding crashers is a return to old school form pun intended grade d
spoiler the main sister is pushed down the stairs the killer breaks a glass of vodka next to her to make it appear that been drinking but right before she is killed tells her business partner garr on the phone that she hasn't had a drink in days yet the police never mention the results of a toxicology report and the characters talk about her being drunk when she fell down the stairs huh really bad mistake in this movie which is pretty awful overall bad considering the great cast some faults the writing isn't very good the music is made-for-tv bad and there is no tension at all because we already know the answer to the mystery from the first scene in the movie
this film was on late at night when i saw it it was interesting at start but it didn't convince me as a whole i am no tyson fan in fact i don't like boxing at all barbaric obscene and double faced society that some get money for beating each other i felt the start of the film was ok actors alright especially george c scott cus d'amato i don't know how reliable the flick is i haven't read books and books about boxing or tyson i don't know anything about the man but it was quite the movie went on i felt it lost a little of charm and i also lost interest i managed to stay awake though but the last hour was just not good enough
i watched this knowing almost nothing about it other than the brief description i read here after watching it i was originally going to say that the director shows promise but seems kind of amateurish then i looked at the other stuff done to see if this was his first or second movie but no he did house on haunted hill and fear dot com he sort of missed the mark on both those movies and it was the same with this story was pretty awful too could someone just fall in love with a girl because pretty but has the mind of a child i gave it a because there were some visuals that i rather enjoyed near the end but as a whole this movie is pretty terrible
the bloodsucker leads the of naked babes in this one with a couple of lesbo scenes thrown in the film is supposed to take place in ireland but it looks more like rome and the adriatic to lesbians get invited to a island castle for the weekend one by one they seem to be missing their heads due to a madperson running not very scary or bloody and the rooms look like they are lit with floodlights even though candles are lit go is worse than usual and the plot only serves as an excuse for the eroticism and nudity directed by euro horror actor alfredo rizzo this is one boring out of
i never finished this movie for a reason it was dreadful and thats just the acting i wasn't even sure what the film was about tbh it didn't make a lot of sense and the violence was awful i mean ususally i like some nude in a film but it was just sick because of what was happening all the characters annoyed me and it was just full of loud screams and the camera was shaking at parts and it looked like a sequel to the blair with project but without any good qualities this is one of the worst movies i have seen in a long time and would like my time back please i wouldn't recommend this film to anyone or even consider it
i went to see this with my wife and yr old son he seemed to like it a lot more than my wife and i did the writing is surprisingly poor for a pixar disney excursion in fact i had a very hard time paying attention at all the movie does look amazing but the story just becomes so weird and long winded that i was hoping my son would fall asleep so i could pick him up and walk to say that the film isn't an interesting concept just told so oddly screenplay especially when we meet the family for the first time i know we're supposed to get the impression that the family is wacky but good lord they could've shortened that sequence by a good minutes i didn't actually time it by that point i was scratching my head looking for an exit
disappointing and irritating the screenwriter has no true understanding of human nature but instead strings together clich√©s in a disjointed fashion character is not explored in depth these are puppets plunked down in a plot he openly confesses needed a dramatic element the affair with her lover reid gives an excellent performance in spite of being given some peculiar situations and lines such standing passively to allow her angry daughter to slug her in the eye the script portrays darren craig as a dr hyde without any hints about why except that he snorts cocaine before the big scene mature writer could have done so much more with this topic
after we counted the use of the f word oh about times in the first minutes or so of the film listened to some really bad actors going on about a woman and a horse and pretty much acting like year old boys being naughty together well we turned it off relying on gratuitous profanity and potty humor is a sure sign of a loser hollywood movie the product of unimaginative and no-talent writers did give it a second chance thinking surely it would get better no dice later my boyfriend skipped through the rest of the movie in case it improved still no main character did have a cool wouldn't recommend this to anyone except maybe really immature adolescents or frat boys
very poor effort that offers pretty much nothing to anyone but a hardcore fan of stanley tucci who tries but can not save the poor structure dialogue direction or talent of our leading much the only trick this plodding tale of a naive new salesman for an alarm company has is its quirky side characters but without a realistic backdrop such characters are to see here keep
possible mild spoiler i watched the first half of guilty as sin i believe it was made in because it played like a jagged edge joe eszterhas clone from the mid it starts with a murder and left for the audience to muse is he guilty or innocent and will he go to bed with his attorney but halfway through the film shows its early credentials by turning into a lawyer gets manipulated and stalked by her client type film which ends in a ridiculous manner and guilty as sin has an even more ridiculous ending in this respect is a very poor thriller but the most unforgivable thing about it is that it was directed by sidney lumet the same man who brought us the all time classic court room drama angry men
i wanted to like this film yes its a saw blah blah blah ripoff but i like those films if done well this had all the ingredients of being a good not brilliant but good those ingredients had gone off the acting was terrible and this was first seen when the captives are introduced with their captor one by one taken off the remarks and one liners are just terrible yes i know bad this is more than that it was bad writing coupled with bad acting two of the captives had been in a relationship with each other and did not even acknowledge this until a lot further into the im even wondering why i am bothering to review this movie at will end with plot holes plot holes more plot holes disappointing
this should be re-titled the curious case of the unscrupulous filmmakers who misrepresented a non-horror snorer as a shock film one long boring tale of a fraternity hazing a gag so transparent that even flounder from delta house could see through it jeff east an actor in the dues-paying stage can be forgiven for taking any work he could get the same can't be said for charles martin smith who formerly acted for such cinematic heavyweights as george lucas and sam peckinpah once available on tape but thankfully not out on dvd misrepresented garbage like this belongs in a landfill and nowhere else
please don't waste your time this movie rehashes the worst of bram dracula helsing anne vampire lestat music and silly biblical references and blade toys i really like vampire movies and novels and there are many out there that are very good but not this stinker not even the soundtrack helps it mostly because the movie resorts to ridiculous scary classical music rather than the kick-ass metal some reported only a few times did i hear any metal mostly it was tortured violins avoid it like garlic and crucifixes
this is the worst movie i have seen since i know who killed me with lindsey lohan watching this movie i can assure you that nothing but frustration and disappointment await you should you choose to go see this hey tim burton i used to be a big fan of yours did you even screen this movie i mean seriously what the giving anything away here is the story in a vague nutshell nine wakes up he does stuff his actions and decisions are irrelevant and the movie ends oh wait here comes a alert spoiler alert at the end of the movie it rains i think a part of my soul died while watching this movie
good grief while i still maintain that manos the hands of fate is the worst piece of mental torture available hobgoblins came awfully close insults the audience at every least films like space mutiny and future war can be enjoyed on this one was a struggle to get through i was literally writhing on the couch in anguish this thing managed to embarrass me if you are a die-hard fan and have made it your mission to see every single experiment think twice about seeing this that bad
in the standard view this is a purely awful movie however it rates a near perfect score on the unintentional comedy scale i can think of few actual comedies that make me laugh as hard as i did watching this movie andy ghost dressed in native american garb dancing sends me into hysterics everytime i wouldn't waste the gas or energy driving to the video store to rent it but if you happen to be laying on the couch at in the morning and it comes on tv check it out
terrible acting lame plot stupid story and just all around terrible movie sums up this piece of junk it was excruciating to sit through just awful do not waste one penny on this the movie theaters should feel bad about actually putting this movie out there for people to watch this horror film was not even in the least bit scary creepy or disturbing it was in no way visually appealing the acting was so terrible by all of the actors that any attempt to draw you into the movie through dialog are completely destroyed within moments of the opening their mouth plus the entire story i don't know why someone would make a movie with this story again do not waste your time or money even if a free ticket don't waste one moment viewing this movie you will feel dumber for watching it
i had never heard of this adam sandler movie until i saw it on the wall at blockbuster being an adam sandler fan at the time i rented it honestly i could only watch about mins of it it was terrible do whatever it takes to keep this out of the hands of the public i honestly hope this movie goes oop soon and i hope it stays that way
when i first watched robotboy i found it fresh and interesting but then i noticed that with each episode this show is trying to teach you how to behave yourself what is episodes became predictable and main characters are not interesting again we see a hyper-smart boy beaten by his older brother parents who don't understand their kid and his friends girl and fat boy also this show has no logic a super-modern robot who works on two aa-size batteries and can use a lot of weapons but the biggest problem is the difference between activated and super-activated modes we see two different robots and it declines main idea of the show robot must learn how to behave himself in human society
misty ayers had a smoking body and all this movie was about pure exploitation flick i started playing a game with myself counting the number of times they looped the stock orchestral music and of course the music is completely unrelated to the scenes case in point casually walking into a room and saying hello was scored with chase music from a roman epic i'd like to know why this film sat on the shelf for years before being released what i learned from this movie that low-rise panties existed in i'm talking sigourney weaver in the original alien movie panties at least of the first minutes is misty leisurely taking off and putting on her clothing for bra and panties sadly also includes horrendous dubbing leading to a look out godzirra effect
i'm not sure how related they are but i'm almost certain that lost and delirious is a remake of this movie the story that based on very similar plotline and even some of the scenes and sets seem to be very very similar lost delirious is actually a much better movie so see that one one moves very slowly but being a late french movie that is to be expected of the style told in a retrospect from the perspective of one of the girls revisiting the school the editing of the flashbacks with the current scenes is a little bit confusing at first particularly since the audio from each overlaps hearing flashbacks while seeing the present and vice versa also the girls are a bit old to think that they are in a boarding school finally not much character development to even get you attached to the movie
the us appear to run the uk police who all run around armed to the teeth and did you know that cid officers change into uniform when they stop work and go down the pub this has got to be one of the most unrealistic films with the worst portrayal of real uk police that has ever been foisted on the unsuspecting public i can see that mr snipes might have needed the money to pay his back tax bill but what the heck a good actor like charles dance was doing in it is a than the worse low budget b film of the an hour and a half of suicide and time i will never get it like the veritable plague
one of the worst films i have ever seen got so bored that i switched it off midway through to watch the news when i switched it back on i fell asleep the film starts with a dream continues with a dream and ends with a dream then there are a few more dreams in between come on what is supposed to keep me interested in that a film needs to have a reason to be interesting the minute you felt the film was only a dream is when any sensible film-goer switches off ever had someone insist on telling you their dreams and what it means to them this is awful
me and a friend rented this movie because it sounded really good but we were wrong first of the acting was the worst the effects were really bad as well it seemed like a film a college kid made the plot was pretty good but it'd been done the thing that ruined the movies the most were the actors the main guy was the worst actor a shame i'm even calling him an only good thing about this movie was it was so bad it was if you want a good laugh see other than far away from this one i usually love b list movies and such but this one i do not know how it was passed to even be put on one is the worst i've i've seen some bad ones
i hated this movie it was absolutely horrible pitiful acting real real real stupid criminals that weren't even the least bit the first home alone movies that were very good all the boobie traps are weak pathetic excuses for ideas poorly copied of of the first two which just meant that the people writing this movie were just lazy because their paycheck didn't go above bucks a week this movie is absolutely lousy not worth even renting in fact don't even watch it on go use your eyes in a more useful way by seeing the first two i barely give this of just trust me when i say if you liked the first two and you are not a complete stupid person you will not like this not watch this movie
why did i waste my money on this on the last day of sundance i want a refund can i have my back while i was watching this film i kept waiting for something to happen nothing did happen the only way i even knew what it was supposed to be about was by reading the plot which was not really like the film why did the director zoom in with their handy cam and then zoom out it was not very artistic why did the director show lulu filing her nails for fifteen minutes why is it when the actors tried to speak they sounded like they were reading or was that the point i felt like phantom love had no story at all and to be honest i felt like my friends vacation videos had a much higher entertainment value than this film
although an r rated movie i really doubt that you'll really enjoy it unless you're a because no real plot no character funny jokes only thing that this movie has plenty of is nudity tons and tons of naked or almost naked chicks nice ones i might add to feast your eyes really can't understand why this movie has the american pie title since only a bad combination between an erotic movie and a comedy without succeeding in being either of suggestion is to watch this movie only if you want to see some naked chicks but you're too shy to an erotic movie it for the smiles i had in the entire movie and another for the nice chicks
peter sellers of my favorite actors is mildly amusing in this turkey but the script is so lame and insulting that even goldie youth after her oscar win cannot begin to pull this one out of the mud as a skirt-chasing celeb in his sellers mostly embarrasses himself to the nth out of best performance nicky henson plays a young study hope hawn and sellers were paid well because i see no other reason for tripe like this in very good year for films husbands joe wusa five easy pieces and many others you can't win them all
this movie got extremely silly when things started to happen i couldn't care less about any of the characters susan walters was so annoying and the leading actor his name also got on my nerves can't quite remember how it ended and so forth but the whole idea of aliens possessing human bodies and all just seemed stupid in this film things didn't quite carry off my dad told me s stupid should've listened to him
seriously what is this hooper has made such classic films like texas chainsaw massacre then he made this god awful film what happened did he dip into the crack a little too much this film is about some dude named sam who has the ability to set things on anyone the acting was godawful the plot was rubbish and the special effects were extremely rubbish they looked like something from the van damme should be pleased that derailed is no longer the worst film ever and what was with the ending he started glowing blue turned into a glowing blue blob sucked out his girlfriends fire and the film ended what was that huh when the film ended i hoped the dvd would spontaniously combust to save me from my away from this think obey you'll thank me later
yeah character whilst talking to the woman from the tv station is right the lapd is a corrupt violent and racist police and this movie changes nothing about it okay here are the good cops the moral cops even a black one whow a christian a martyr but this is a fairy tale admit it reality is not like that and most important for the action fans the shoot out is boring just shooting and shooting and shooting nothing more play counter strike then you will at least have something to do the only moral of this film is the lapd is good now no more bad cops in it if you like uncritical euphemistic commercials for police and military service watch this movie the longest commercial i've ever seen points for camera and editing
i am a huge fan of david lynch this film however was a quite disappointing experience apart from the ambient background music which really sets the mood of the film it lacks almost all the qualities that i've come to associate with work the visuals are dull to say the least and the dialog is to vague and monotone to be of any feels more like a film students awkward try to do an arty dogma movie than the work of an experienced director i've seen a lot of amateur movies with far superior camera-work scenery sound and script this film lacks almost all artistic qualities i feel as though i'm watching one of davids home videos produced during a weekend trip with some friends
the progression of the plot is enough to rope one in and create curiosity about the outcome however ultimately the feeling that remains is that the producers of the movie forgot to end it if the intention was to create a perpetual circle done in the twilight zone it was too sloppy to view as a positive effort
i am going to keep this adaption of the wonderful king book is a bad joke and nothing course there are many kubrick and nickolson fans in this site a movie has mysteriously find its way in the nicholson is laughable as torrance and so is shelley has nothing to do with the an incoherent mess and the characters of jack and wendy torrance are complete advice to anyone that hasn't read the book and wants to understand the characters of this to the tv series and the people who are saying that kubrick had every right to destroy the king story cause king a good writer should stick to reviewing masterpieces like eyes wide shut
this soap opera knots landing has all the entertainment value of being trapped in an elevator every episode contained plots such as rape murder kidnapping and drug smuggling not much different to the plots of other drama shows of the period as for the cast i've seen better actors on a cereal box from the mid to late repeats of knots stunk up like a mountain of mildewing nappies i regret to announce that i had to suffer this as my mother was a huge fan of the show and would watch it religiously though since then re-runs have been few and far between hope it stays that way the only positive thing that can be said of knots is the catchy saxophone signature tune later used as the title music for the sitcom the upper hand great legacy that eh
the world may have ended unfortunately this film survived as yet another testament to inability to make movies that go beyond the execrable maybe because all our really good people jewison martin short et al go to hollywood in fact too bad short wasn't cast in this apallingly pretentious and banal film he might have given it some credibility the canadian government should realize and this movie is a magnificent example that shovelling money into the trough does not result in good cinema if the people lapping up these public funds had had to compete they might have been forced to come up with something worthwhile as it is they have produced yet another snickering embarassment
good deaths good mask cool axe good looking watch out no plot and little scares completely lower standards they tried to make an i know what you did last summer but ended up making a scream but hey what do people expect from a horror movie answers totally vary rent it if you want but i regret ever seeing it
this movie was the worst movie i have seen since date movie i was laughing through out the whole movie instead of being scared it was funny how the snakes would search for particular section of the passengers body to attack for example the eye the tongue the butt the breast if we have seen national geographic channel we know snakes wont stay clinched on the body once they bite for each particular scene the snakes would bite the passengers and would stay on the body biting the person i believe the producer did not study his information on snakes and their behavior i cant believe i wasted my money on this i don't recommend this movie trust just wait until it is at the dollar theatre or rent it
this movie is one of the most awful movies ever can jon bon jovi play in a movie he is a singer not an actor he killing vampires with his guitar and what about the dreadful plot o my god this movie really sucks in the end is the queen of vampires played by the eternal vampire arly jover surrounded by an army of vampires but when the fantastic slayers arrive only vampires are left what happened with the other vampires they run out in the sun and what about the grand finally when bon jovi blows her head with a shotgun really a not in buffy the vampire slayer in episodes not a single vampire is killed with a shotgun this really is a lack of originality
that is interesting as it is laughable pretty what you manage to see a made for tv thriller that is not as bad as the worst of them jeffrey coombs plays a brilliant although misguided scientist that tampers with stem cell research and manipulates human dna with that of a hammerhead shark the horrifying results give birth to one hell of a killing machine a group of scientists led by william forsythe and hunter tylo are invited to a remote island to check out the brilliant new experiment of course after laughing and stammering in creation by the way is his own son fused with a hammerhead is let loose to hunt down one by one his colleagues revenge is not always rewarding also in the cast elsie muller johnson arthur roberts and velizar binev
i've read some of the comments about this film and can only surmise that some people are easily entertained this movie is nothing so badly written directed and acted that it barely makes an impression the characters speak in cliche-ridden dialogue and the situations are completely implausible while that might make this campy and fun it doesn't because everything is so lifeless the film becomes dull as if lee rose decided to write a drama about a woman struggling with her sexuality but then she either wasn't allowed by studio execs to give the story some true-to-life gusto or didn't have the cojones this movie could go in the enyclopedia as the standard-issue bad lifetime tv movie
nothing could have saved this movie not even years ago the special effects would have been amazing better directing might have gotten some more feeling and better performances out of the actors but nothing but feeding the script to a dragon could have fixed it plot holes bad lines terrible pacing endless replaying of the same shots of a cgi dragon stomping through hallways this one at all
this is complete and absolute garbage a fine example of what a bad movie is like this can't be appealing to anyone not even b-movie fans do not i repeat do not waste precious time of your life on this piece of trash bad acting bad directing horrible i mean really horrible script and complete lack of an idea as to what entertainment any form is i bought the dvd for dollars i swear i could almost pay someone to take it burning it would not be enough for what this movie did to me i like b-movies the killer toys the weird lagoon monsters but this is nowhere near you know those movies that are so bad they are funny not even just plain old pathetic
well i could nt get into the plot but thats just me maybe listless camera-movements at times nevertheless this movie has got a charming vintage acting is genuine at times and entertaining with the occasional chase sequence involving scantily clad ladies which was nice the climax is confused and disjointed but still err riveting thanx to stella stunts are interesting specially because of the las vegas backdrop there are a few jerky hand-held camera-movements at the end which keep me guessing for a while but i don't think i ll b chasing the dvd just yet
many people here say that this show is for kids only hm when i was a kid years old i watched this show first it was disgusting for me i talked with other kids about this and sure other shows and know what this was the measure of disguise whenever we wanted to emphasize silliness on tv or anything else we said uh just like power rangers and laughed before visiting this site i could not imagine that there actually are fans of mmpr it was so strange for me that i decided to watch it again and try to understand why people like it i did not enjoy that viewing but it dawned upon me maybe i have not enough imagination it may be however this argument is not sufficient for me to rate it more than star
i kinda liked the film despite frenzied pace but i did not appreciate the comment that canada was referred to as montana north it is definitely not montana north and never will be americans wonder why they are perceived as arrogant in the rest of the world and that is one reason why stop teaching the kids of the united states of america to think they own the planet such a centrist world view is not becoming of one of the great nations even in jest i would never refer to the usa as alberta south walt would never put us down so why start now other than that the film was pretty goofy better luck next time
i wasn't sure whether to laugh or cry porretta was good looking but resembled like a mexican porn star not an english outlaw costumes what costumes a t-shirt with strips of black leather on it it was lack of really got me do the fans of this stinker really believe women dressed like that in medieval england the mongols and vikings were inaccurate and stupid but the episode with an alien was worst of all especially as his make up mainly consisted of oatmeal on his old hedgehog monster was pretty funny as was climbing up the side of a castle on a ladder of if the us accents grated as did the initial drawling voice over raw-bin hood and liddle second robin and marion were really quite minging in looks and what was left of the show went totally down the pan
this is one of the worst films i've ever seen i looked into it mainly out of a morbid curiosity since i loved the novel and i wish i hadn't i turned it off after a little less than an hour though i wanted to turn it off after five minutes i wish i had it disregards the novel a lot and changes all sorts of factors unless the film managed to redeem itself in the last or so minutes would be impossible i would in no way recommend this its an insult to one of the greatest writers of the century i don't think as many people say that it is that the bell jar is necessarily unfilmable but this particular rendition could have been done without i'd almost like to see this one day in the hands of a director and screenwriter who can do it justice
i hate this programme not only is the very concept ludicrous but it tries so hard to be feasible that was left out of similar i confess ending programmes like muder she why is it that the writers can't ever be intelligent enough in this programme to come up with evidence that would stick and win a decision in on after x-amount of years of the cases being unsolved why must every suspect every episode it to a murder which would otherwise go bet all police wish that criminals were this good sportsmen aw shucks officer you're a bright one i guess if you've uncovered enough to convince yourself i did it i may as well admit to it and make it easier for you in court what can i say a fair dog and an insult to those of us with with enough brains to even have heard of
it was the worst ending i have ever seen if some one can please tell me how and why the last chick goes crazy and eats the old women in the end why dose the movie have all those cheap crappy scares in it in the beginning but yet when the first person dies they kill them all off in minutes most of the people could act but i do give so credit to the porn stars they did their best also it had a couple funny parts and kills like when the care taker gets his organs riped out of his ass and then gets choked with it if this movie had an ending that could make any since i would have given it a out of but the ending made no since the ending sucked but the rest was great
i just couldn't stop laughing this movie is incredibly funny and stupid but never mind that it is very entertaining in this film you don't need to pay attention to anything the acting is the same lame the dinosaurs are the same rubber my i could see the stick that holds t-rex head for a moment the raptors are the same from the carnosaur t-rex is also the same but in some scenes his head looks kinda stuffed and it looks like some kind of project failure from kindergarten action is fast sometimes too fast actually i talk about fast editing they edited it so fast so that we cannot see the rubber dinosaurs but oopps to late they are rubber well only things interesting here is to see rick dean in this can i say don't rent it watch it on tv with friends it is much more entertaining
first of all i saw this movie when i was years old at a christian scholl i attended needless to say that i was scared out of mind not because it was scary but because the was anyway the cinematography was pretty bad and the acting was cheesy very bad considering that i was only and i remember that the one thing that still haunts me is that dreadful song i wish we all were ready where the chorus ends with you were left behind i wouldn't suggest seeing this one i probably will just for nostalgic reason besides i'm sure the remake is much better the best part of this movie though has to be when everyone dissapears vacant cars crashing lawnmowers running on their hilarious
irene dunne finished her illustrious career with this so-so movie she should have gone out with a bang being the classy actress she was not in this unmemorable almost unknown film lightweight comedy is okay but nothing special the first half of it is far better as it gets pretty stupid in the second half maybe irene could see the handwriting on the wall and quit even her high-pitched voice got a bit annoying in here rumor has it she was not happy with this film one can see story reminded me of a television sitcom speaking of that i thought david nelson from the ozzie harriet tv show was in this movie but it turned out to be a very young richard crenna he looked and sounded just like so-so at best and a sub-par ending for a great actress
having heard so much about the cracker series without seeing any of them i looked forward to this eagerly surely the combination of jimmie mcgovern and robbie coltrane could not go wrong how wrong i was polemics backed by frequent repetitive and violent flashbacks were overpowering the production tried to be super-modern but the flashing boxes and even the childish font irritated robbie coltrane sleep-walked through the two hours coming up with unexplained and unlikely insights and the police were portrayed as one-dimensional bumbling idiots as a result the tension never built up and the next-to-final scene details for fear of spoilers was as laughably bad a piece of tv drama as i have seen for a long i don't want to see any more of these but i will go back to the dvds of the series to see if they match their reputation
this movie was just heckled by and with good reason first and foremost because it is a cop movie starring joe don baker who we all know is about as good a cop actor as michael jackson is a country western the typical cop movie plot devices rear their ugly heads bar fights children hostages in shoot outs bad acting lame police chiefs bad acting endless goons and of course bad acting don't watch this without an filter folks
here finally a movie comes out that i can honestly say is worse than larry the cable guy health inspector yet i'm willing to bet the the will make more money than i ever make in my whole life on what is sure to be one of the top five worst films of all time outside of my fifth grade outside the class re-enactment of romeo and juliet i mean really why would anyone ever ever see this movie unless they were paid to the comedy is weak and all even remotely funny jokes from the flimsy plot were surely revealed in commercials final word is this movie was a terrible letdown for me and the commercials looked so promising
oh my god the worst i've ever seen is the main thought which came into my mind right after watching the movie and i really do not understand anybody with opposite myth though maybe the idea was good but the effect miserable i especially mean the role of h graham what was that in my opinion it has destroyed all positive intentions of producers the character was played in affected and annoying way every time she appears it reminds that you re watching a movie and is destroying a spirit of the moment then whole movie because the most time what you can see there are her stupid faces with more stupid attempts to create the emotion terrible don't waste your time
i can not believe i wasted my money to rent this movie i thought it was a porn flick when it started and it never got any better the acting the music drowning out the actors horrible save your money you have to read the movie all the way through they knew the music would drowned out the speaking lines i never got the part about the slaughterhouse or the need to continue to show cows and pigs being butchered what did that have to do with the real btk killer i understand why there were no famous in this movie the script would have turned me away within the first page of reading you would be better off watching paint dry
holy freaking god all-freaking-mighty this movie was so bad i thought i was on drugs in a bad way the character acting is the poorest thing i've seen in quite some time this movie was more akin to lord of the g-strings a real movie most of the movie appeared to be done on a horrible green screen my favorite part was when they are in the carriage and you can tell no horse they're fleeing from alien monsters and going about the same speed as a swift jog then it switches to a far-shot with a ridiculous cg horse and the cg in general seems to be sub-par to beyond the eye i mean come on really it felt like a horrible episode of hercules only without kevin sorbo there to save the day worst movie ever
i know that actors and actresses like to try different kinds of movies hey no one wants to get typecast but danny glover brenda fricker birthday brenda and christopher lloyd should have known better than this angels in the outfield is another movie in which everything seems lost until someone or something magically comes and saves the day do i even need to tell you how it ends the movie is just plain lowly escapism of high escapism are the various sci-fi movies from the if these movies had some political undertone or at least offered us a new look at life then they would be ok this one is just pointless far closer to diabolical than angelic also starring tony danza adrien brody and matthew mcconaughey and i suspect that they don't wish to stress this in their resumes
somehow they summed up the ten years that radically changed our country in four hours and what a painful four hours it was they trivilized the major events and happenings and they claimed it was about two families yet you barely saw the african-american family if i were nbc i would be ashamed and embarrassed for airing such trash what was amusing was this happy-go-lucky family you saw in the very beginning was tortured in so many ways but managed to attend every major event through the country and the second family was such a non-factor they devoted maybe five or six scenes total to this family that poor son please nbc do not make any movies about any other that to pbs and the history channel
this mindless movie is a piece of crap and boring like the full house repetitions for all the people who want to see a great exciting and cool horror movie shouldn't even think about watching this bunch of mindless work a in my opinion i have one question what were they thinking make a list bad script bad script bad script bad acting bad directing and last but not least a bad script i mean i am not like grumping about every movie but i was disappointed when i watched it this movie should be banned into a box locked and sunk down into the sea so please don't do something like this again please please please
suffice to say that despite the odd ludicrous panegyric to his soi disant abilities posted here the director of this inept odious tosh hasn't made a film since well that is excellent news as far as i'm babies has all of the bile of its creator but lacks the wit and technical proficiency that make martin amis the novelist will the british film industry wake up and realise that if it wants to regain the status it once had it should stop producing rubbish like this and make something real people will actually want to like the plague
that seem to be fooling people into seeing qualities in this film that are just not dark covered the same territory but with much more class and the script kept their big secret so long was a total mystery to me i guessed it at the breakfast scene at the start of the film by the time it was revealed to the viewer it was just a case of big deal tell me something i don't found this to be pointless movie that may have challenged the genre conventions unfortunately those conventions are that horror films are tense and packed with genuine sense of horror this was woeful
watched out of andre dupont fairly lame account of the titanic disaster is the first filmed version of this much-heralded event the replication of the disaster is not bad but the drama around it is at some times silly badly acted and way-too soap opera-like the story is very much the same as the most recent oscar-winning one except that we are shown how the crew tried to hide the actual disaster that was occurring until almost too late good for nostalgia purposes only and to get a feel for what james cameron was competing in his recreation
i saw his film at the ann arbor film festival i am a film student at the univeristy of michigan so i know a thing or two about film and crispin film is outrageous he basically exploits the mentally challenged not only is shirly temple the anti-christ i admit is a little funny telling the mentally challenged to kill each other but there is an obsession with killing snails crispin also plays with the idea of being in love with one of his actors who is as they all are mentally challenged peta and human rights should be all over this thing not counter-culture as crispin stated at the ann arbor film festival exploitation
loyalty to peter falk is all that kept me from giving this awful picture the it deserved that matter loyalty to mr falk was what kept me watching this film all the way from heads to tails even if you forgive all the glaring errors this was just plain the poorest excuse for a made-for-tv columbo film ever i'm glad i watched it on tv for free would have hated to have coughed up the bucks for a print
dalmatians disney i wasn't a fan of the previous installment and this effort has all the weaknesses of the first a silly padded storyline terrible over acting by glenn close who hams up every scene as though playing for her own amusement and incredibly borring and uninteresting lead actors once more the dogs are the only actors that seem real and thats a stretch another wasted effort here grade d
i'm a big fan of the true crime genre but i couldn't sit through this putrid piece it was almost as if dahmer was intended as erotica down to the porn-flic soundtrack there was no look at what made dahmer tick no exploration of who his victims were nothing but look at how creepy this guy is and i have to give the filmmakers this much their dahmer is the creepiest thing ever to disgrace the screen
now i won't deny that when i purchased this off ebay i had high expectations this was an incredible out-of-print work from the master of comedy that i so enjoy however i was soon to be disappointed apologies to those who enjoyed it but i just found the compleat al to be very difficult to watch i got a few smiles sure but the majority of the funny came from the music videos i've got on dvd and the rest was basically filler you could tell that this was not greatest video achievement honor goes to uhf honestly i doubt if this will ever make the jump to dvd so if you're an ultra-hardcore al fan and just have to own everything buy the tape off ebay just don't pay too much for it
spend your time any other way even housework is better than this movie the jokes aren't funny the fun rhymes that are dr seus aren't there a very lousy way to waste an evening my kids laughed a little at the beginning the younger ones got bored with it and left to play barbies and the older ones left to play and surf the net my wife left and did dishes so i finished it alone it was the worst kids movie i have seen if you want to watch a fun kids movie watch shrek that movie is fun for kids and their parents avoid this movie it isn't funny isn't cute the makeup is about the only good thing in it and you can see that on the disc label
nightmare weekend stars a cast of ridiculous actors with even less of an idea of what is going on than the director had if you can imagine that there is no decipherable plot or story the special effects are a joke and even the sound is terrible this film was directed by henry sala it was the only film that he ever directed and the reason is obvious
for the knowledgeable beatles fan the main value in this movie is to just sit back and pick out the flaws inaccuracies combined events omitted events wildly exaggerated events omitted people timeline errors mis-attribute quotes incorrect clothing out of place songs and shame incorrect instruments and other boners i just cant think of right now the flaws come fast and furious so you'll have to be on your didn't give this a primarily due the fact that it is filmed in liverpool and the actors band rain give it their all lennon character is credible and does a good job also the song cry for a shadow is heard at one point and that counts for watch it for fun but please don't take it as historically accurate
it really impresses me that it got made the must be really charismatic in reality i can think of no other way itd pass script stage what i want you to consider is watching the films i was feeling sorry for the actors it felt like being in a stand up comedy club where the guy is dying on his feet and your sitting there not enjoying it just feeling really bad for him coz hes of trying id really like to know what the budget is guess it must have been low as the film quality is really poor i want to write the jokes didn't appeal to me but the reality is for them to appeal to you you'd have to be the man who wrote them or a retard so imagine that in script this guy got that green lit thats impressive isn't it
i am appalled at how bad this film is as a pastiche of early century hollywood artistes it sets a new low even past the moderns or cradle will rock i never thought i'd see a film worse than those granted they were about a slightly different milieu period nevertheless the intents results were distressingly off the horrible casting eddie izzard as chaplin excuse me peter did you owe this guy something jennifer tilly as loulla parsons kirsten dunst as marion davies holy smoke these people don't even begin to try to capture the look or sound of the period they are purportedly last picture show was a decent film but this thing is a disaster the rest of pics haven't been much better guess rubbing up against welles hitch ford wore off a long time ago still good for hosting tcm though
this version is pretty insipid i'm afraid jane eyre is one of my favorite books and has been since childhood but william weary throwaway acting style is completely unsuitable to the bold passion of edward rochester and poor charlotte gainsbrough looks like a bored petulant teenager whose dental braces hurt i also can't believe that they eliminated great marriage proposal scene from the end of the book one of the most moving moments in literature i do appreciate that they finally used such a young plain woman to play jane a character who is supposed to be a worldly but if you want to see a version that closer approximates the personalities and passions of the novel please see the version with george c scott and susannah york york was too old tall and pretty to play jane but no one has touched character the way that scott did
in keeping with well-known practice of stealing i mean buying out known properties and bastardizing them this live-action version of the venerable cartoon classic has got to be one of the worst re-makes in a year of bad re-makes i grew up on the original cartoon tv series any episode of the original cartoon series will give you more laughs than this entire movie not present is cool computer book also not present is the gag with the self-destructing orders that always ends up detonating on the chief new are a smooth talking gadget convertible original cartoon had a cooler vehicle that could turn into a van or a car and an element of a typical unrealistic hollywood romance don't fill the coffers to pay for disney executives and even their don't see this
hopelessly inept and dull movie in which the characters stand around in rooms or a rocket ship and talk endlessly you might think things would perk up when they explore mars but these scenes are filmed through a heavy filter which makes everything very murky the martian consists mainly of drawings and the monsters are entirely unconvincing there are echoes of bride of the monster when the heroine carefully winds the octopus like tentacle of a flesh eating plant around her before weakly thrashing about the difference being that the ed wood film is a hundred times more entertaining better wear earplugs when watching otherwise the sci-fi music score repeated endlessly will drive you insane if you find yourself unable to sleep one night just slip this one into the vcr and your insomnia will be cured in no time
i can't believe that so much talent can be wasted in one movie the gingerbread man starts of on the right foot and manages to build up some great expectations for the ending but at some point the movie turns into one of the worst stories i've ever wasted my time on just so unbelievably how the bewitched mallory doss manages to pull kenneth character around by his nose the movies climax is as uninteresting and flat as a beer which has been left out in the sun too long the gingerbread man is probably the worst grisham-movie ever and this isn't changed by the fact that talented stars crowd the movie don't waste your time here
i absolutely fail to see what is funny in this film the humor seems to be destined for corpses slow the story is too simple to be true the characters do not raise much sympathy a few non-important characters aside nothing surprising happens what did the writers of this script think oooo funny make some old high on pot make them giggle make them behave like little children oooo yes absolutely brilliant and film has irritated me most from all the films i've seen in the last five years
this movie shows a clip of live animal mutilation of an animal getting hacked by a machete and getting its skin ripped off i know these horrible things happen in the world but im watching movies based on the fact that what im watching is not actually happening on the screen these live animal clips are not meant to be in movies they are meant to show people that belong to certain organizations to help the horrible things that humans to do other should be banned and destroyed i have also contacted netflix and other resources to collaborate getting this movie off the movie should be removed from the public the person who made this movie needs psychological help
i would have enjoyed this movie slightly more had not been for jason evers constant harping on experiment many early reviewers of the seven samurai accused toshiro mifune of overacting yet as more and more critics viewed that film they saw it as being purposefully done jason evers is obviously not toshiro mifune and his overacting is exactly of the actors in this b classic were rather good actors minus evers and the showgirls if you watch this movie you would have noticed evers shouting almost every line that is until he is smoking and blowing the smoke coolly out his nose special effects were par for the course in a b movie such as this one in hindsight there isn't much that stands out in my mind as fantastically good or bad for this movie
this movie is truly brilliant it ducks through banality to crap at such speed you don't even see good sense and common decency to mankind go whizzing past but it doesn't stop there this movie hits the bottom of the barrel so hard it bounces back to the point of ludicrous comedy behold as kor the beergutted conan wannabe with the over-abundance of neck hair struts his stuff swinging his sword like no tomorrow the way he swung it i really am amazed there a tomorrow for him or at least for his beer gut don't miss this movie a fantastic romp through idiocy and sheer bloody mindedness and once you have finished watching this one dry the tears of joy tears of frustration at such an inept attempt at storytelling from your eyes because some stupid gave these people another to make a sequel
i've been watching a lot of cartoon or animated movies because i have a baby girl who likes to watch tv i began to watch this movie to see if i would like my little one to watch it and no at the beginning i thought it was such a cute movie like the bambi movie but all the way it was like insinuating the ducky was a homosexual the info said that they were making fun of him because he wasn't good at sports but that was not the case it just seems like a movie made for kids to learn to be okay being gay it was also very sad as far as the dad and all i don't know i guess if you're gay you'd like it but i don't think i'm going to watch it again with my little one
william shatner in small doses is tolerable unfortunately instead of leaving his character as a minor irritation and in that moderately amusing it has been seen fit to enlarge his role and overdo it just as occurred in the original star trek series i guess i will never understand american humour which frequently goes over the top to get the message through i vote with my feet i no longer watch the show which is a shame because the rest of the cast were good it is pity that overdone role also affects james performance but the majority demonstrate the way society is going i guess i don't travel the same routes frank
the story is about the life of common people from antwerp living their lives so i said it and there is nothing more actually to tell about the story the movie is fast like an mtv-flick and well photographed and we feel that the director is talented and should do more films so forget about this one and hope for the best with the next deus-barman picture
considering the original film version of the haunting is in my top ten films of all time i approached this adaption with trepidation i was right to be cautious as this film is a poorly written and badly executed load of old tosh all those involved should be ashamed the original was terrifying to me as a child for one reason you see nothing robert wise used innovative camera-work and superb lighting to generate fear and this is why it the shame of the new version is that it relies on clever special effects and pyrotechnics to get from a to b sadder still is that the ingredients were there such as liam neeson catherine zeta jones to do something different this film should only watched as an example of studio butchery
the plot is about a female nurse named anna is caught in the middle of a world-wide chaos as flesh-eating zombies begin rising up and taking over the world and attacking the living she escapes into the streets and is rescued by a black police officer so far so good i usually enjoy horror movies but this piece of film doesn't deserve to be called horror not even thrilling just the flintstones or kukla fran and ollie will give you more excitement like watching a bunch of bloodthirsty drunkards not being able to get into a shopping mall to by more liquor the heroes who has locked themselves in inside the shopping-mall to avoid being eaten by the hoodlums outside are not better either even though they doesn't seem to be drunk they give the impression of being mentally disabled save your money instead of spending it on this
it was agonizingly bad movie it will eat your heart out while you watch it i beg you don't watch this movie you will hate you losing hours of your lifetime not as some movies that are so bad that you can watch those and enjoy this movie is boring as there is nothing as boring as this movie you will hate yourself after watching this movie till the end and you will hate yourself that you didn't listen to hate myself i tortured myself and i did watch this movie to the end now excuse me i will shot myself i have seen read this very carefully don't watch this
you know i can take the blood and the sex but that thong bikini shot pretty much did me in someone get that girl some pasta before too you know just not a good idea for a schlock movie to start off by mentioning the much better movie ripping gave this one a just because marginally better than tobe crocodile
any one who saw the original would have to go out and destroy this dreadful remake alex baldwin trying to imitate the late steve mcqueen in a word for word remake just doesn't work while baldwin has done some admirable work this is a flop from start to finish mcqueen had charisma never try to compete with a star as for kim in the role of ali mcgraw enough said mcqueen looked dangerous menacing and believable as doc the film had excitement and and company made this into a laughed the one and only time i saw this miserable film and that dreadful hairstyle for michael madsen who is one of more exciting and believable actors did the makeup people have it in for michael what were they you wish to see movie-making the way it was under sam direction get the original
birthday girl doesn't know what it wants to be is it a comedy is it a just doesn't know what could have been a very funny or touching film ends up in land the premise is original enough to have warranted a script full of interesting scenarios but hardly delivers any and ends up petering out this is a real shame if you look at the cast very solid all the way through but they don't get the chance to shine very disappointing
the story of the film was as simple minded as its morality go find a girl marry her live with her happily ever after though the film had some fine moments and turns most of it stayed at the surface of what might have been shown in a film with the same struggle was only touched superficially and was mocked about probably intentionally a more interesting story would have been a mixed you wanna see a film which doesn't need too much concentration which can be watched by the whole family and which teaches your children modest and conservative values the modern tolerance stuff you will be fine with this film might be shown at a family-home-evening
you know you're in trouble when john cassavetes is operating at half-speed instead of full-throttle in a movie and the incubus is a dreadful worst-case scenario of a great actor going through the motions to pay the bills actually observing the hammy script and john baroque art direction one can hardly blame him the movie has something to do with a series of rape-murders going on in a small town with a lot of supernatural hokum mixed in somehow the direction manages to suck tension and interest out of every scene and cassavetes seems visibly at times the incubus itself which doesn't show up until the last scene is a well-done creation but not worth waiting
if you enjoy the original snl cast and shows then avoid this movie at all costs when this first came out my friends and i waited in line for over an hour to get in to a sold out movie house half way through the movie the theatre was empty we refused to leave thinking it would get better when the movie ended we were the only ones left in the theatre the movie lasted only one day in all theaters then vanished from sight in interviews with mr mike he refused to comment on this film the film was an inside joke on the episodes of snl that came out right after the films release and closing in one day we all tried to contact mr mike by phone and mail to get a refund but were totally ignored
from the star of mitchell from the director of joysticks and revenge these are taglines that would normally keep me from seeing this movie and the worst part is that all the above mentioned statements are true ugghhh joe don baker eats every other five minutes in this film like a bad remake of bluff
this movie kind of reminds me of a mary-kate and ashley movie-only worse just the rich sisters kind of thing i think even though alysons more the actress in this movie amanda michalka was okay sometimes but alysons acting stunk i think that after high-school musical they needed to come up with somethihng better and this definitely wasn't it the story line wasn't that great and i think they should have gotten two other people to play taylor and courtney i'm not a big alyson michalka fan and this movie didn't make me like her any better i think they should definitely sick to singing and only watch this movie if you have nothing better to do sadly i didn't
the only connection this movie has to horror is that it is horribly unentertaining i would rather prick my finger with a rusty nail than have to sit through it again even for a tv movie it is flat the cast is boring the screenplay is as exciting as a bowl of sand how two directors conspired to create such a nothing movie will remain one of the great mysteries of the century there is only one scene even vaguely worthy of inclusion in the omen franchise and it is shot in slo-mo and cut short at the anticipated pay-off if you are tempted to see this pop it in set your alarm clock for minutes and get comfy with any luck you'll doze off quickly and the alarm will wake you once the worst is over namely this movie
national class reunion was a flop when it was released it didn't stay long in theaters in my big city why because bad in a good way but bad in a really painfully unfunny way the entire cast of actors were mostly unknowns then and have remained unknowns after this idea is actually great parody of slasher flicks but the execution is sorely lacking in every aspect avoid this comedy your time is more precious than spending a nanosecond watching this embarrassing misfire
carnosaur primal species d jonathan winfrey scott valentine janet gunn rick dean anthony peck rodger halston terri j vaughn billy burnette why even bother reviewing this movie another stupid dinosaur movie in which top secret military guys discover those lethal very fake-looking prehistoric monsters running around killing people in gory ways the original was bad enough the sequel was even worse this falls somewhere in between though unrelated to either of the previous carnosaur films rating out of rated r for graphic violence and gore grisly images and profanity
cq could have been good campy fun but it commits the only unforgivable sin it is b-o-r-i-n-g the pace is deadly slow and the plot is fairly confused and so artificial that next to impossible to care where going the story would have been acceptable in a creative writing class from a thoughtful and sensitive eighth grader but this video should have carried a warning label caution student film fit for viewing only by relatives of the film maker
mst should do this movie it is the worst acted movie i have ever seen first of all you find out that the shooter has no bank account and no history since leaving the army in and pays his rent in cash there is no way in hell that a person like that would ever be allowed to be that close to a president not to mention a high profile job also the head of security for the pothus would not be so emotional that he would start drinking into a haze if the president was shot this movie sucked i cannot express the extremite that this movie was every single actor was terrible even the chick at the trailer park i crap on this garbage what a waste of time
jason priestly stars as breakfast a psychotic jewelry store thief whose grip on reality is frighteningly precarious according to the dvd sleeve with his accomplice panda coulson the duo make off with a carload of cash a result of a tip-off from beautiful cashier ziggy harris her reward to hitch a ride with the out-of-control duo so that she can meet her long-lost father francis mchattie but on a suicidal quest to even a score with his former boss gossett jr and has the cops hot on his trail rage murder and revenge are about to collide stay out of their the highwayman keoni waxman jason priestly laura harris stephen mchattie
a sexually obsessed chef leads a duplicitous life one as a happily married man with a ten year oldish child the other as a sex fiend the bulk of the documentary-like film follows him for five consecutive days and is told in flashback with nastassja kinski as a clinical sex therapist listening to his story and intelligently probing him role is very restrictive and she is the only principal adult character who does not take off her clothes if she had i would have rated this movie a big fat f as it is it rates an implying that it is still a failure unless one likes to be bored it is probably a lot more interesting to spend ninety minutes cleaning out the garage diary of a sex addict falls into the category of films that once one has seen it one wishes that one hadn't
this movie has beautiful scenery unfortunately it has no plot in order to have a plot there must be a conflict this movie had none it spent two hours painting a beautiful scene and failed to ever place any activity in it the picture tries to be artistic but fails to pay attentions to the fundamentals of story you love montana scenery and fly fishing you will find some value in this film just don't expect a story there isn't one
split second might have been a good movie a story about a road rage homicide has a very young clive owen giving a pretty good performance the filmmakers undercut their own movie with idiotic camera-work and truly awful editing the camera jumps all over creation in an unsuccessful attempt suppose to reflect stress from business family and traffic what this actually does is to give the viewer a the filmmakers cared nothing about making a good movie but only to impress each other with their idiotic photography one ought not waste time on this travesty
do not watch this sad excuse for a film i have wasted time and money on this and am pretty off about acting is comparable with high school plays the script is shocking there is no plot twenty minutes from the end i believe i should be rewarded for reaching i had a headache from all the screaming crying and wailing the five girls majority of the violence is for a film nowadays suggested rather than graphically depicted but i found the characters so damn irritating that i wanted to see them and indeed every single person involved in the making of this piece of die in the most horrible ways spend ten more minutes of my life saving you from a very poor minutes of yours don't do it
kevin kline and meg ryan are among that class of actors which i am always interested in seeing despite reviews i have always found ms ryan to be a charming and winsome actress in nearly all her roles and kevin kline is almost always worth say nearly and almost in large part because of this off meg ryan does not play a likeable character she plays a weak-willed whiner who begins grating on your nerves shortly after the opening credits and doesn't give up until several days later that said kevin character is even more annoying and less likeable so even if you normally like these two actors i recommend your give this movie a pass
the only enjoyable thing about this highly mockable movie is playing guess that location what toronto landmark will stand in for what knew that the anti-christ would be russian obviously he can't be american since we need the yanks to save the day oh buck you'll tell us all the truth you'll show us the light and the way outta the building should those nasty anti-christers get their golden raspberries faith is not enough to hope they don't make another of this ilk we don't gotta prayer
using footage pillaged from planet of dinosaurs this shot on video for the stolen footage concerns a bunch of people shot into space who land on a dinosaur planet that wait for it is really earth its a five minute sketch stretched to minutes slightly better than chickboxer in the bad movie police a nostalgic home movie feel coupled with good stolen effects this movie is still an impossible slog to get through i'm left to ponder the question are we becoming so uncreative that we're now pillaging old movies not only for plot but also for mismatched footage clearly low budget producers are getting so desperate they really will give us anything to take our money
whoever made this nonsense completely missed the point jane is a silly comic strip to titillate without being giant mess tries to be funny and exciting but is just a shambles there is not one decent performance in the usually reliable jasper carrott is painfully american bloke whose name escapes me is just as rubbiush as he was in flash adams tries as a villianess but she is a bit long in the tooth for this type of thing all of these things would not matter if the girl was sexy or funny or is not kirsten holmes faded into obscurity after this and so much the flushed more entertaining things than this down the toilet avoid
can i off imdb says this is in the late means carlito would be very close to going to prison he got out in and said he was in for years they used a bunch of nobody actors and a story that didn't even make sense they bring back only one actor guzman and hes playing a totally different guy why did it end with him and this puerto rican chick wheres gale he said he was in love with her before wheres kleinfeld he said he knew him think he'd have been in this one and if this made sense where are rocco and the black dude in the first one it was all just is an insult to pacino and the first film
this is an attempt by both author edgar rice burroughs and filmmakers at an arabian tarzan of the apes but this desert-set film shows none of the majesty present in burroughs more successful jungle adventure the focus is on the love between handsome english noble jon hall el lion chatham and exotic arab beauty kathleen burke princess eulilah with revenge happening to coincide with their urge to merge the opening states that although guilty of conduct unbecoming the mother is living but she never re-enters the picture unfortunately the lion man has deteriorated and is looks like missing the lion man john p mccarthy jon hall kathleen burke ted adams
i was hoping for some sort of in-depth background information on the apollo mission and what i got was some decent interview material with buzz aldrin gene krantz and other people involved in the mission linked by over-hyped disaster-predicting sensationalising voice-over in the worst tradition of tv you could cut out the voice-over and change the spin of the program to a positive testament of how people can overcome setbacks to achieve a goal out of the ordinary then this could've been great but i feel i've wasted about minutes of my life whilst watching a minute programme i want those minutes back
nut case is murdering college students can new teacher stop the me you won't a title like splatter university one would immediately gather that this movie just isn't high art but worse than that splatter university doesn't even qualify for amusing garbage splatter u is so poorly made the story is mindless the characters are throw-aways and the whole movie lacks any essence of imagination needless to say there is no suspense or atmosphere or scares this drivel isn't even brave enough to throw in any nudity the cheapest thrill of all so all around this endlessly flawed slasher offers nothing in the way of entertainment even cheap laughs and just becomes a complete bore bottom of the barrel folks even die hard slasher fans will want to think twice before viewing let alone paying money for this out of
we brought this film as a joke for a friend and could of been our worst joke to play the film is barely watchable and the acting is dire the worst child actor ever used and hasslehoff giving a substandard performance the plot is disgraceful and at points we was so bored we was wondering what the hell was going on it tries to be gruesome in places but is just terrible
dont let the mpaa fool you with their rated r for extreme violence there is definatly no extreme violence in this boring peice of i expected some cheap rambo type action that the trailer promised however its just boring boring nonsense with tons of lame slow mo flashbacks that make no sense avoid
really took the words right out of my mouth i loved early films and feel like the only one who is still faithful to him i just saw this movie fell asleep about through so i didn't see the end when i woke up and saw i was at the dvd menu i was thankful i didn't subject myself to any more of that movie and didn't dare find out what happened at the end there was something strange about the voice of segal and others kinda reminded me of the original mad max where the voice were dubbed but in the same language is english right anyway if i had thumbs they'd all point down right now for this segal injustice
i do not know who is to blame miss leigh or her director but her performance as catherine is almost impossible to watch ben chaplin on the other hand does a superior job against all odds as far as i am concerned his character is entirely too charming and appealing but certainly not shown as greedy enough to put up with silliness chaplin appears bemused by what cannot possibly be understood as shyness and lack of grace but rather her orthopedic unsteadiness there has to be some element of believability to his interest but as played it is incomprehensible the performances do not jibe maggie smith and albert finney are of course wonderful despite any effort to derail them the supporting cast is also a pleasure to watch what a pity too the leads don't work together because the production is lovely to look at
i mean really this is not going to help the australian film industry to make this kind of film with no values of any kind okay if you're a stoner and have nothing better to do then maybe i think film-makers from here should try to show the rest of the world what great talented people we have and this is not the vehicle for it come on now this film is just tacky
strictly a routine by-the-numbers western by genre-mainstay andrew v mclaglen so is that any wonder army colonel brian keith spars with smarmy bandit dean martin who has just kidnapped the wife blackman who never found her niche after playing pussy galore in goldfinger fist-fights shoot-outs stagecoach robberies and denver pyle in a supporting other words absolutely nothing new or original talking in a low monotone throughout keith gets to dally with a prostitute of a shock after his run on family affair but otherwise this low-rent material wastes amiable talents also bad news for dino who doesn't seem to notice or care hack direction poor writing and several unfunny attempts at lowball humor from
holy crap this was the worst film i have seen in a long time all the performances are fine but there is no plot really no plot a bunch of clowns talk about this and that and your film ug robert character is senile and keeps asking the same people the same qestions over and over this earns him the same responses over and over i am pretty sure this film got upto a six because people think they should like it good performances with famous and well regarded actors but the actual complete work is a steamy turd well maybe a bit deceptive since steam rising from a fresh pile sounds a little like something happening and in this film nothing happens sack
i'm sorry i had high hopes for this movie unfortunately it was too long too thin and too weak to hold my attention when i realized the whole movie was indeed only about an older guy reliving his dream i felt cheated surely it could have been a device to bring us into something deeper something more don't buy a large drink or you'll be running to the rest room my kids didn't enjoy it either ah well
after the success of scooby-doo where are you they decided to give scooby and shaggy their own show but unfortunately they added a new character that spoilt scooby-doo success forever they invented a new show with a new title scooby and scrappy-doo it was scrappy-doo that made this show a complete failure probably for both adults and kids together scrappy was the stupid brave puppy that always looked ready to beat someone up scooby and shaggy were getting scared of the villain and they were also trying to stop him scooby-doo doesn't need any little annoying bastard puppy nephews if they wanted scooby-doo to be more successful they should have either killed or never thought up scrappy this was just poor maybe your kids will prefer it
well what can you say about sitcoms there often quite lame morale dedicative and just plain so is this show it got a boring cast although is okej in her perky way the rest is just stereotypical always we have all seen it before and will probably see it all over again when this show is cancelled cause lets face it its a mediocre and self righteous show as the most sitcoms in short if you wanna see some good entertainment you can rather take a twenty minute pause in front of the mirror do some faces and move on its more entertaining than this show
lynch the man has some really great stuff he knows how to disturb us then reward us by getting us think in different ways this however is altogether different reward is absurd comedy earned by enduring stupidity i may have laughed once but somewhere around episode i just started watching on fast-forward didn't miss a thing i felt relieved when it ended and part of the point with this series an annoying series about annoying characters in annoying situations rounded out with annoying animation voices and sound but recognizing this and its other absurdist qualities still fails to make dumbland worthwhile
i cannot believe i wasted minutes of my life watching this terrible film i kept hoping it was going to get better by the end but boy was i wrong the plot was abysmal the acting was extremely poor and the special effects were awful not even the beautiful girls could revive my interest in this boring and bloody mess however i cannot lie some of the lines in this film were quite memorable such as when the asian boy says i lost my virginity to the babysitter so stereotypes do not waste your time with this crash unless u are prepared or want to have a good laugh maybe that way u can watch it to rip this movie with some mates
all these reviewers are spot on i've seen many bad films over the years believe me and this beats the is not just a so bad good exploiter waste of time but a genuine hilarious movie out the white furry monster type yourself laughing at thom spell-weaving in sheer disbelief at the threadbare is one of those european co-productions no wonder we have so many wars i swear some of the people taking part in wizards of the lost kingdom aren't actually aware they are appearing in a i originally watched this movie on htv wales late one night while suffering from concussion and sleep deprivation i had to track down a copy several weeks later to make sure it was really this awful it is worse even than lee majors in the norseman more laughable than all of john films this is truly the citizen kane of trash
the movie that shoots scenes of a scenic caverns no one from this movie except for michael pataki who dished out extreme pain as jc in five the hard way the really annoying sheriff who i did applaud when he practices nightstick on our rabid doctor probably the most laughs you will have is with dr epileptic seizures out of nowhere could mrs beck be anymore wooden seriously if you took a foot branch stuck it in a hot tub you wouldn't be able to notice a difference the dread and suspense is looking over at the clock wondering when the credits will it as a late night movie mstified but don't go out of your way
assuming this won't end up a straight-to-video release i would have to say void this title at all costs unless you're bored of good well-executed movies that is i saw this last night at afi dallas and i left with minutes remaining simply because i didn't care anymore the plot not about insulting the is awkward when you can spot a goof only minutes into the movie shot out shattered window before any shots are then the window breaks with the first shot things are going to bad just say this is only an indicator of things to spare you all the details but this is sub-par in every manner even the half-assed acting by michael madsen is disappointing when you're expecting half-assed acting from him and the rape shut up and take it should never be used in a rape scene
anyone not aware of the original british lion movie the wicker man doubt have left the cinema with the impression poor and a devotee of the original i left with the impression purely the grim reality of haggle toothed inbreds drawing the force of law and order into a web of paganistic barbaric ritual on a remote scottish island named original to a near amazon-ic colony off the maine coast of the us named summersisle the remake hardly hits the is quite sadly a case of what could have been a classic remake of a classic being tampered with to cater for a simple minded public nothing more and nothing less given the reworked context of the film ladies involved hang your heads in shame
mary lou is a slut whose spirit seeks revenge on those who let her come to her fiery doom back in the movie mainly takes place in the movie falls into the trap of special effects including some weird demented looking rocking mary spirit does bad things to people and tries to take over one body whether or not she succeeds you'll have to watch to find the movie is largely boring and based around a bunch of worthless characters this also isn't really a sequel the only thing in common with the first is the name of the high school it has the avg horror flick fall backs gore pointless nudity knocks against the catholic church basic stuff boring acting is decent enough to give it a out of you can waste your time doing something else
what the hell is this its one of the dumbest movies i've seen i don't understand why people on this site love it so much its senseless for no reason its worst then resident evil i strongly don't recomend it unless you want to watch chessy bad acting crap watch real horor movies such as stephen it the shining jurassic horor jaws etc leave this crap for a rental when there is nothing else to rent it is bad as crudy vs gayson attack of the killer tomatoes is better then this wow flesh eating zombies how many damn zobie movies do we need skip this outta
how rick sloane was allowed to make five movies is harder to believe than cold fusion this film is absolutely criminal before watching this movie i thought manos hands of fate was the worse piece of crap i ever saw but at least manos moves so slowly you might fall asleep thereby rescuing your eyes from the pain it will suffer the greatest tragedy of this movie is that the old man that keeps the hobgoblins locked up makes it to the final scene the time i spent watching this movie was an absolute waste of my life
i created my own reality by walking out of the theater i was roped in by my girlfriend into going to this dreck with her mom we g-friend and i walked out about an hour into it what a load of pseudo scientific new age atomic particles are thoughts by taping labels to bottles of water and blessing it by a buddhist monk it grew little pretty crystals a drop of in the murder rate in dc happened when a bunch of folks meditated wow what a rigorous scientific study i'm sure that someone ate cheerios for four days straight during the same time should we conclude that eating cheerios caused a drop in the murder rate hooey bull pucky it was funded by the ramtha cult the leader of which was one of the experts which were interview by the filmmakers no ulterior motives here right
in this strangely-lackadaisical apocalypse the world suffers from a dual plague of zombies and vampires but no one seems to be too worried about it in this grade-z film which bares less resemblance to sheridan le famous short novel than my lasagna recipe bored attendants still run gas stations and doctors still make house calls and helpful police officers still show up with radiator fluid just when you need it the plot and i use that term loosely involves a father and a daughter trying to rendevous with the general whose daughter is missing at a church to kill a vampire who very conveniently happens to be traveling with the father and daughter i must confess that a moment or two of genuine humor can be found between vast stretches of unintentional humor the film also boasts just enough nudity to keep a boy of fourteen interested anyone older beware
what was the point of this movie what was the plot i do not know shaq can't act people don't know how to direct and i am kazaam a genie who raps come on maybe eminem or linkin park will be in a movie like this i remember i watched this just to kill time it didn't really interest me i just remember thinking who put shaq in this movie the whole story seemed stupid too it made no sense whatsoever i guess an unrealized moral of this movie is that you can find anything in the ghetto and anything can happen i can't comment much more because this movie is so terrible nothing worth commenting about i wish this movie would go away
i saw this feature as part of the asian american film festival in new york and was horrified by the graphic sado-masochistic child pornography that i witnessed the story line is hidden beneath way too many graphic sex scenes and not one is in the least bit erotic sick is the more the feeling the director seemed to be going for shock value rather the exploring the various levels of why these characters are like this see it if you can stomach it i still have flashbacks
if you seen rodney previous movies and performances you'll recognise several of the jokes made in this odd piece of dreck written like a sitcom this movie fails to strike any sort of likeable chord throughout from the self-help doctor played by the aways sexy-as-chopped liver molly shannon to the i'm fat and therefore funny john linette the wives themselves are likeable enough and if this had been done as a pilot for an action-adventure series it might have worked instead it comes off like a male fantasy trying hard not to be politically incorrect
i was so looking forward to seeing this when it was in it turned out to be the the biggest let down a far cry from the whimsical world of dr seuss it was vulgar and distasteful i don't think dr seuss would have the grinch stole christmas was much better i understand it had some subtle adult jokes in it but my children have yet to catch on whereas the cat in the hat screamed vulgarity they caught a lot more than i would have up with dr seuss it really bothered me to see how this timeless classic got trashed on the big screen lets see what they do with horton hears a hope this one does dr seuss some justice
it was so terrible it wasn't fun to watch at all even the scene where the girl is using a vibrator even not fun to watch in this movie i say again the scene where a girl is masturbating with a vibrator is not even fun to watch or maybe if that was the only part of the movie that you watched just girl on couch using a vibrator maybe they should have just released that one scene in theaters maybe then the movie would be enjoyable on a certain level my advice fast forward to that point watch it rewind the movie watch it again rewind repeat maybe you could enjoy yourself for hours that way this movie ranks alongside i spit on your grave and doom generation in the category of worst movies that i have ever seen
this was a disappointing horror film about a snotty young girl and her nightmares for a horror or thriller film and hype way too tame there are only a few tense moments in here not anywhere as near as many as should have been for a film of this genre even those tense scenes weren't much the music made them more dramatic that they actually is a lot of symbolism in here so the elitist critics label this a thinking horror film well if they think about it i'm sure they will come to the same conclusion i did a waste of money at the video rental a yawner that offers an unlikeable lead character and generally poor acting vastly overrated and certainly not what it is advertised
this is certainly the worst movie i ever saw the beginning is somewhat good but the end i still don't even get it magical power years later goddess dancing what the is that about the acting is somewhat not so bad but some place i could do better for sure
bashki should be congratulated for attempting to convert one of the great works of english fiction into a movie and then slapped silly for this attempt the animation was poor the characters looked ridiculous the music was overwhelmingly blaring and the film was a ramshackle blitz through the first book and a half of masterpiece i can still remember my sheer disappointment and loathing for the movie when i first saw it now i realize that any attempt to convert a book into a movie is bound to fail in many ways simply because of the medium but this movie regardless of the source of the story is just plain pathetic bashki is capable of much more
what a bad movie i'm really surprised that deniro and even snipes would be associated with something like this if you're going to make a movie that involves baseball and shows scenes of baseball at least make the action look somewhat realistic why was the crowd always standing up for no particular reason during games and the last scene in the was that we are somehow led to believe that deniro has found his way onto the field in an uniform and that the game is even being played in a torrential of the worst ever scenes in a sports movie stars out of
how can a major german tv station broadcast a mess like this amazing how the main actors avoid every acting talent even the well-known gottfried john is acting very poor especially in the double murder scene how amateurish the screen plan is very very extended perhaps to fill out parts of the movie be careful not to fall asleep while watching the set is obviously very often a blue screen the scenes on the ship with unreal sea in background in the german version the sound and the dubbing is very poor probably reason different languages of actors but other international productions do handle this much more professional advice do not watch a diabolic waste of time
basic slasher movie premise young ladies wreck their car and end up staying with a creepy family minutes of a premonition of car chase with a white sedan instead of a bronco lady with hot and cold dementia controlling her daughter minutes of watching the actors eat yawn trying to identify what the heck they are eating ok there might be a drinking game here nope yawn shower scenes ok got my interest for a couple of random and uninspired killings yawn ending dude that psycho is deranged why couldn't the rest of the movie be like the last minutes unfortunately that is it my advice fast forward to the last five minutes and watch that and then put something good in the player for me i am going back to sleep
is the only way to describe this movie about subjects that should be surefire scandal sex celebrity power kirsten dunst grins her way through her role as silent movie star marion davies like she thinks in legally blonde the guy who plays william randolph hearst overacts to the point where you want to reach into the screen and slap him eddie izzard is pretty good except that playing charlie chaplin and is about oh lbs too heavy for the part hard to believe this hamfisted uneven wreck was directed by peter bogdanovich but then again he hasn't made a watchable movie in what years sometimes just no coming back
i started watching this movie expecting some barely tolerable hammer horror film wannabe and i wasn't far off a fair amount of glimpsed gore and they threw in lots of nudity but the latter half of the movie presents a few ironic twists holy cow they actually put a little thought into the story and didn't completely fall into the predictable stuff one expected at the outset and dare i say it some of the gratuitous nudity wasn't so gratuitous after all because it fit in with the story and get me wrong still overall a bad movie but as bad movies go a shade more intelligent than the really horrible tripe like mesa of lost women and robot monster
i was glad to watch this movie free of charge as i am working in the hotel industry and this movie came lately to our movie library nothing against low budget movies but this movie has horrible acting and directing how can a movie as this one ever be made the director should be blacklisted and for all the poor actors it is for sure not a jumping board into a career please make sure that you'll not watch this movie the acting is lame the camera and directing awful there are just a few more movies out there which deserve to be called the low another example would be dracula people who make money with this movie should give it to charity so at least it serves for a good reason this case i would watch it even another at least one more time
i read the book celestine prophecy and was looking forward to seeing the movie be advised that the movie is loosely based on the book many of the most interesting points do not even come out in the movie it is a b movie at best many events characters how the character interact and meet in the book are simply changed or do not occur the flow of events that in the book are very smooth are choppy and fed to the view as though you a child the character development is very poor personnallities of the characters differ from those in the book the direction is similar to a b horror flick i understand that it would take six hours in film to present all that is in the book but they screen play base missed many points the casting was very good
this was an awful movie not for the subject matter but for the delivery i went with my girlfriend at the time the movie came out expecting to see a movie about the triumph of the human spirit over oppression what we saw was hours of brutal police oppression with no uplift at the end the previews and ads made no mention of this plus for all that they played up whoopi goldberg my recollection is that she is arrested and killed in the first minutes again the previews say nothing about this that you would expect that but just more of the problem if i had known how depressing this movie would be i would've never have seen it or at least i would've been prepared for it this was a bait and switch ad campaign and i will never see this movie again
i am a great fan of martin amis on whose book this film is based unfortunately the director has been unable to translate the book to the screen the novel is thoroughly post modern and highly artificial in its wildly overblown characters and the disintegration of traditional plot line and character development it is an hilarious examination of human greed excess and emptiness by one of the most moral of contemporary british writers the director of the film has completely missed the point of the novel in his hands the film screams along at breakneck speed indulging in every known trick shot and odd camera angle possible it is like ken russel on acid and suffers from that older self indulgence cranked up to a hundred not even the glimpse of gorgeous actor christian penis was enough to save this wretched film for me abysmal
so sad that romanian audiences are still populated with vulgar and uneducated individuals who relish this kind of cheap and demonstrative shows as superficial and brutal as the garcea series or the vacanta mare child-plays the difference is that mugur mih√§escu doru octavian dumitru and other such sub-artisans never presume to claim their shows as art pintilie who years ago made a very good movie la ora sase followed by another one nice enough tries to declare his film-lenghts art works but unfortunately he masters at a way too limited level the specifically cinematographic means of expression as such niki ardelean offers again a sample of how not this being about its only merit
don't bother trying to watch this terrible mini series it is a six hour bore an unbelievable love triangle between three people who have absolutely no chemistry for each other there is no heat in this story no real passion no real romance it is a dry boring drawn out and uninspired as they come and it doesn't even meet the expected level of technical proficiency take those six hours of your life and use them for something more worthwhile
damn i thought i'd seen some bad westerns can't top this one though hell i think i'd rather have my eyes stapled open for a trinity triple feature for cryin out loud i dont think i'll be able to watch ben hur again without laughing my ass off just really hey if you like stupid westerns with acknowledged stars in the thing take a peek at shoot out with gregory peck just as bad but much funnier
but this just isn't working and i am surprised to see how many people consider it good on what grounds there are some loose hints here and there but the whole material is self-indulgent and unconvincing movies are generally intriguing because they generate a sense of confusion and yet are very playful when doing that there is some visual sense there are some subplots characters ideas etc but this is dull and yes pointless because whatever there is to explore is either to small either too far-fetched or simply told before in a superior manner just lynch exploring dv nothing more so it should be treated like this
this is without doubt one of the worst films i've ever plot is so full of holes the story is like a bad remake of a bad suspense movie and the actors sound like were reading directly from the manuscript for the first time worst of all is steve guttenberg he plays his character like he was in police academy the same foolish womanizer and not suited for a leading man in what should have been a really hard to believe that hanson would make confidential ten years this like the plague
truly awful film made by cinematographer-turned-director ted tetzlaff decent enough looking film but for a time-bomb movie totally devoid of any tension whatsoever ford as someone put it here sleepwalks though this one with his characteristic smirk there are some details thrown canadian ex-army or raf defused bombs in the war his wife is leaving but none of these back stories add up to much the bomber himself is a complete mystery why is he trying to blow up this shipment of mines for that matter what time period are we talking about here wwii or postwar i assumed the latter which makes motive even more salient generally though just a horrible film there are plenty of good time-bomb flicks to skip this one watch any episode of danger uxb for a more exciting time at about the same running time
terrible probably the worst film i have ever seen and i did see some pretty bad pictures throughout the years the sound sucks so does the quality of the picture the direction the etc the only good meaning funny because they're so bad are the special effects overall there are about minutes worth of laughs the rest of the flick gives you brain damage
lethargic direction ruins an otherwise compelling period story that stars the wondrous zhang ziyi in an excellent role as a woman who joins an extremist group in china just prior to the japanese invasion of manchuria and reunites with a former lover who is now working for japan every bit of drama and forward motion of the story is sucked dry by director ye somnambulist directorial style characters stand still staring at each other for long minutes saying nothing hand-held cameras hold forever on faces showing interminable reactions way longer than they need to edits repeat the same reaction is triple redundancy we know nothing about the characters as the story begins and are given little new information as the story progresses only silence and static shots of lovers who don't speak who interaction through silent dances but share no apparent emotional intimacy a very sleep inducing film
i don't know where to start the acting the special effects and the writing are all about as bad as you can possibly imagine i can't believe that the production staff reached a point where they said our job is done time for release i'm just glad the first two in the series never made it as far as the uk i would actually recommend watching this film just so you can appreciate how well made most films don't know how any of the other imdb users could find it scary when the terrifying dinosaurs waddle down corridors with rubber arms flailing around
what is this is it a comedy a horror movie or just nothing this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen especially the scene in romania when he becomes the werewolf that must be the worst scene that has ever been made this movie isn't funny it isn't scary and not entertaining at all please do yourself me i don't think anyone should suffer through this movie a favour and don't watch this movie if you get is a present just throw it away and chop it in to pieces
well i rented this movie and found out it realllllllly sucks it is about that family with the stepmother and the same stupid fights in the the cool son comes with his stupid camera and he likes to take a photo to damaged building and weird things and weird movie and then he asks his father to take him to a side trip and simply agrees etc etc etc they go to that town which no one know it exists blah blah and the most annoying thing is that the movie ends and yet you don't understand what is that have seen many mystery movies but that was the worst honestly it doesn't have a description at all and i wish i didn't see it
it was a decent movie i actually kind of enjoyed it but the ending is so abrupt there is absolutely no closure and it leaves tons of loose ends what happens after the concert what happens with her boyfriend does she hook up with grant does she come beck in the next semester and what about angela obviously performance would knock angela down a few pegs but nothing is shown to indicate how she reacts there is so much left up in the air and very unsatisfying i don't know if it is trying to leave room for a sequel or something but it is a terrible ending and i think that it really makes the movie a joke i was very disappointed
the dialogue was pretty dreadful the plot not really all that inspired beyond the obvious twist it presents not visually stunning actually visually annoying at times most definitely one of those films you find easier to finish if you keep one finger on the fast forward button if you could watch it for free have absolutely no other options open at the moment and you really dig seeing the little poltergeist lady well maybe i'd recommend it to you but not anyone else i could think of at the moment
tarzan the ape man is a remake of the film of the same time and like that earlier film it has little resemblance to burroughs literary character but while the tarzan was reduced to tarzan jane speech this tarzan played by miles o'keeffe doesn't speak or even grunt he does do the the tarzan yell a couple of times which sounds like it was sampled from the earlier tarzan plays second banana to bo derek as jane or rather as third banana to bo left breast and her right breast this movie has no point but to show derek two action scenes in the film are presented in slow motion and are really bad more evidence that no one enough tarzan has an orangutan side kick in this film maybe he car pooled in from sumatra with the indian elephants that are also on display
this movie looked like it was going to be really funny i was very excited to see it but was very disappointed it was very unrealistic the plot was also pretty weak i was expecting it to be really funny but the jokes weren't even that good i was also really disappointed with the ending i would not recommend this movie to anyone
there was a bugs bunny cartoon titled baby buggy bunny that was exactly this plot baby-faced finster robbed a bank and the money in the carriage rolled away and fell into rabbit hole he dressed up as a baby to get into hole to retrieve the money the scene in little man where looking in the bathroom mirror shaving with a cigar in his mouth is straight from the cartoon this was a hilarious cartoon not so much an entire movie if you are really interested in this buy the bugs bunny dvd was much more original the first time plus you'll get a lot more classic bugs bunny cartoons to boot
the perfectly stupid weapon i think the guys dancing at the beginning of one of steven movies was intented to mock jeff doing his forms to dance music at the beginning of this stupid movie the plot is predictable the fights were fair and jeff acts about as well as the sofa he beats with some sort of weapon in one scene
well what can you say about a barbara cartland are some amazing actors in this reed sarah miles christopher plummer but they clearly are clocking up the anthony and marcus gilbert have appeared in two other cartland epics anthony with hugh grant looks suitably embarrassed and gilbert with helena bonham you really want to see a watchable adaptation of cartland the bonham carter one is the one to go for hazard of hearts what a title gilbert is the weak link in that but bonham carter is suitably beautiful and of course can actually act and the rest of the cast play it to the hilt with tongues firmly in cheek fox diana rigg
the leap years stars some heavy hitters in the local and regional film and television scene and yet they cannot save this movie it has so many things going against it over acting overly melodramatic poor script inconsistent direction and too few things going for it decent music good cinematography this comment is mainly for anyone who throws all local movies into one basket after watching this film and says all local movies are bad please do not judge the rest based on this one film this is a television soap opera masquerading as a romantic feature film my hopes were high when i bought my ticket and my hopes were dashed five minutes into the film
this movie is very important because suggested me this consideration sometimes you can wish to be sick sometimes you can wish to have a syndrome sometimes for example you can wish have goldfield syndrome that way you'd not remember this boring movie and above all you'd not remember adam superfluos sandler sometimes simply you can wish have rented another vote out of my suggestion if you are neither a fan of boring romantic comedies or adam sandler a joke don't exist adam want to hope it save yourself someone to save drew barrymore perhaps
the good earth is perhaps the most boring film i've seen in my life the plot is slow and lacking the acting is borderline comical while i love paul muni i can now say i have seen a film that does not do his true ability justice the only saving grace i found with this film is production value the use of hundreds of extras throughout the film creates a very believable and interesting environment also the beautiful effects used to create the illusion of millions of wasps sells easily and was revolutionary at the time other than the production value i can say little else that is good or entertaining about this film
i and a friend rented this movie we both found the movie soundtrack and production techniques to be lagging the plot appeared to drag on throughout with little surprise in the ending we both agreed that the movie could have been compressed into roughly an hour giving it more suspense and moving plot
jim belushi is having a mid life crisis nothing is going right when his car goes out on goes into an empty bar where michael caine shows him what life wouldve been like if one event in high school had come out differently a good premise with some mostly flat and uninteresting on a scale of one to
virgin is selected to marry rich guy rich guy urinates woman on boat likes sailor sailor urinates virgin attends gross-out commune dinner man urinates on dinner table boatwoman does strip tease for little boys man pretending to be baby urinates there is an underlying theme here makavejev is trying to say that he is off at the world to say that this is a bizarre movie is an understatement to justify the title there is a scene where laure who hardly speaks ten lines the whole movie bathes in chocolate syrup it is a sweet scene indeed but the rest of the movie leaves a bad taste in mouth unless one happens to share the fetishes
but this has to be the worst a christmas carol adaptation of all time and that takes some doing what with the likes of various lifetime efforts don't get me have nothing against cicely tyson i've enjoyed her tremendously in other roles at sipsey in fried green tomatoes for example but the script gives her no option but to chew the scenery and chew it she does with all the enthusiasm of tiny tim tying into a christmas me the classics anytime alastair sim with the exception maybe of scrooged all the others are just over-the-top efforts to grasp the past present or future spirit of christmas
look i'm sorry if half the world takes offense at this but life is confusing enough i don't need to watch it that way i dig anthony hopkins big time i even watched fracture and i knew that would be a steaming pile of quentin but this thing is not well shot and not if it is artsy well-produced films have reasons for cuts and fast edits not this oh but a realistic interpretation excuse this thing'll make your head hurt the fastest moving picture ever to take you nowhere at all i still love ah and i'll always give him another chance but if you aren't made of time to watch bad ideas on screen skip this
slow boring extremely repetitive no wonder the weinstein company did not buy this this spurlock should eat more mcdonalds while filming himself and quit producing there is no way you can watch this and enjoy the preacher is a joke the whole idea is not funny you can make a minute film with this idea not a feature i am so sorry i rented this movie i will never watch anything with the name spurlock on it it is completely garbage filmmakers like this should be on youtube and never be granted a distribution deal the film states that the american consumers and their shopping are at fault for the current depression when shopping and buying products making money circulate in the system are the base of a healthy economy
normally i'm not the sort to be scared by horror movies but this movie is the exception some how this movie got into my mind it is a very simple movie but at the same time extremelly effective it has great atmosphere and this leads to some shocking moments the girls father coming down the hill is a real standout another seen was the family photo i wasn't expecting that and i jumped out my seat i would recommend everyone to see this movie with the lights out it will stay with you for a long time
it appears that many critics find the idea of a woody allen drama unpalatable and for good reason they are unbearably wooden and pretentious imitations of bergman and not kid ourselves critics were mostly supportive of bergman pretensions whining accusations to the contrary notwithstanding what i don't get is this why was allen generally applauded for his originality in imitating bergman but the contemporaneous brian depalma was excoriated for ripping off hitchcock in his films in robin view a strange form of cultural snobbery i would have to agree with that
the original les visiteurs was original hilarious interesting balanced and near perfect must be a candidate for worst first sequel to a really good film in everyone keeps shouting when a gag doesn't work first repeated another times with some vague hope that it will eventually become funny is a horrible parody of except of course that a parody should be inventive if you loved just don't see this film just see again
smithereens is the kind of worthless flick which just hangs out among the cable channels taking up space like a cheesy dime novel in the public library a worthless bit of tripe and first effort for mediocre director seidelman the film is fraught with bad acting bad sound bad camera work and poor quality in all aspects of the film many better films never make it to market and why junk flicks like this one do and never seem to go away is one of great mysteries
this movie has to be the biggest pile of steaming i have what more can i say than bad bad bad bad bad bad there is nothing to save this movie and i pray that they never even talk about making a sequel if you are thinking about watching this then you should know that the storyline is that two garbage men get dragged into saving the earth movies like men in black has been torn to shreds and put back together to make this comedy but have totally failed please avoid this movie yourself
deceptive advertising i saw a commercial for carlitos way rise to power that states from the producer of scarface and way lets get it straight michael bergman did not produce scarface in fact he was editing room assistant for scarface not to take away from talent but in my opinion he should of had a little more class i think i can speak for the masses when i say we hate being blatantly lied to as far as the movie goes it was poor at best i did think puff daddy did a good job although luis guzman should be ashamed for working on this film overall this film did not do a good job filling in the blanks for way obvious this project was an attempt to make a quick buck rather a good film
never cast models and playboy bunnies in your films bob star about dorothy stratten of whom bogdanovich was obsessed enough to have married her sister after her murder at the hands of her low-life husband is a zillion times more interesting than dorothy herself on the silver screen patty hansen is no actress expected to see some sort of lost masterpiece a la orson welles but instead got audrey hepburn cavorting in jeans and a god-awful poodlesque moon and the last picture show i could watch again and again this clunker i could barely sit through once this movie was reputedly not released because of the brouhaha surrounding ms tawdry death i think the real reason was because it was so bad
beach bunnies gives b-grade films a bad name as a fan of the genre i was appalled to find little attempt being made to exploit the young actresses talents i refer specifically to the distinct lack of nudity and simulated sex scenes what are the next generation of sad teenage boys watching this on late night tv supposed to think
one of the worst romantic comedies worst movies i've ever seen boy works as a phone psychic must pretend to be gay to move into apartment with woman of his dreams hilarity does not ensue boredom light gay-bashing and horrible dialogue do if you read brad meltzer and like his crappy dialogue you'll like this smart avoid this if you see it destroy the copy
this is truly terrible painfully irritating stylised performers screech and mug gratingly incoherent dialogues which take place in scenes which seem to have no purpose no beginning middle or end cut together without any apparent narrative or even cognitive intention all in the service of some entirely uninteresting and almost undetectable story what makes it worse is the pretentions to style suddenly a remote-head crane shot spirals downwards and without any apparent reason there are sudden whip-pans or wobblyhand-held sections all this style merely serves to magnify the almost unbelievably huge misconception of the project and the almost offensive vacuity of the material definitely a candidate for the worst film ever made
i'll keep this fast and sweet five girls on their way home from a football game decide to take a short cut that leads them down a deserted forest-ridden road of course nothing but good things happen to them and they safely arrive at their they don't soon they're hunted down by a deranged chick who has some severe mental issues and what ensues is minutes of sheer hope to never see any of these actors in any movie ever again their screaming screeching voices gave me a headache and the script was so poorly written that it included a lot of repeat phrases and nonsensical hysterical screaming all in all one of the worst cheap horror flicks i've ever i've seen a lot
this had to be one of the worst films ever when kate shows up and jed is with a bunch of guys and they all start hollywood another bad scene was when kate was running her hands over the pavement it appeared that she was examining the texture of the pavement acting is so bad in this film i could not connect with them or feel there love for each other the other women however were very good and overshadowed andie anyway this was such a campy movie i usually like these type of films but i just couldn't get into this film too many unlikely situations and again acting didn't help the film also she is all gums lancome must put her makeup on with a putty knife because she looks glamorous in the commericals
don't even bother with this movie bad when judged on own merits but when compared to the original is a classic down right awful and btw somebody commented that the movie is bad when compared to the book this is silly movies should never be judged against the books they are taken from they are completely different art forms if this needed to be pointed out but apparently it does if you used this criteria for all movies then would suck and so would forest gump and silence of the lambs
what a terrible starts well with the title sequence but about as good as it movie is something about rats turning into monsters and going on a killing spree the acting isn't so much poor but the script is pointless and the film isn't even scary despite the atmospheric really is amazing that some group cobbled together this bag of rubbish and thought it would make a good isn't a good film trash and i urge you not to waste a minute of your life on it one out of ten
from a plot and movement standpoint this movie was terrible i found myself looking at the clock in theater hoping it would end and relieved after long minutes that it mercifully did basically five characters appear in the movie a son father girl friend and two male characters of the age who appear and then disappear without context or explanation the movie and scenes seemed to suggest homo-eroticism but nothing ever actually happened to reveal this one way or another there were a couple of brilliant scenes at the beginning of the movie the girl friend shows up at a window outside his room and they engage in an odd conversation the photography and acting lent an incredible seductiveness to the interaction between the two ending with her admitting to having another man who was older end of that story
i looked forward to seeing this movie when it came out since i was a huge snl fan when my boyfriend and i went to see it the people coming out of the early show were yelling don't waste your money but of course we had to find out for there were a few funny bits bra root boy slim most of it felt like it could have been severely edited down to an amusing hour show it was pretty the opera singer came on many people got up and walked out this made me laugh because i realized that o'donoghue was just pressing buttons on purpose with this movie or else he was just insane whatever you don't need to waste your time watching it that bad
this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen however the little slave girl alice and jared harris imitating christopher walken is what makes this movie entertaining smoking drinking and uncanny way of showing up when her name is called is strange and interesting i have to applaud jared for his christopher walken imitation and christopher walken for allowing this to be in the movie
i actually liked this movie until the end sure it was cheesy and pretty unlikely but still it kept my attention on a rainy afternoon until the end that is for her final performance at the prestigious classical conservatory where she has struggled to catch-up to the other classically trained students what does the main character do wow them with her grasp and execution of this time honored musical tradition no she tortures and butchers the great sensuous habanera from carmen and turns it into an utterly forgettable brittany spears-wannabe pop song my ears bled and in the supreme moment of horror her teachers gave her a standing ovation any teacher not in a spears-induced fantasy would have failed her on the spot save your time save your ears skip this movie
this film is deeply disappointing not only that wenders only displays a very limited musical spectrum of blues it is his subjective and personal interest in parts of the music he brings on film that make watching and listening absolutely boring the only highlight of the movie is the interview of a swedish couple who were befriended with lenoir and show their private video footage as well as tell stories introduction of the filmic topic starts off quite interestingly alluding to culture actually american culture traveling in space but his limited looks on the theme as well as the neither funny nor utterly fascinating reproduction of stories from the renders this movie as a mere sleeping aid yawn i had expected more of him
not the best of actors director has concentrated on projected stardom rather than giving a good entertainer may be hero himself his family and his sincere fans can enjoy definitely not worth for neutral fight sequences are a total dance moves in the song sequences are pathetic the music is film was the biggest flop for the actor inspite of the hype created over the movie the movie failed miserably don't even think of watching this move even if you want to kill time you can watch some cartoon good movie buff cannot digest this crap for hours
this movie is complete crap avoid this waste of celluloid at all costs it is rambling and incoherent i pride myself on plumbing the depths of sleaze cinema from everything from salo to salon kitty i like being shocked but i need a coherent story however if watching horses mate gets you off this film is for you the saddest part was that lame werewolf suit with the functional wang i mean its just plain hard to sit through not to mention the acting is terrible and the soundtrack is dubbed badly please i know the cover is interesting looks like a gorillas hands reaching for a bare don't waste your time or money as you won't get either back
i really hate this show i had watched one episode and i knew this show is really terrible the story lines are both poorly written and executed and the jokes are really mean it is just a rip-off of laboratory and johnny quest bout an obnoxious boy with flamed blond hair with his twin genius sisters and talking dog a stay-at-home dad and a smart super-busy oh-my-flippin'-god their dad is a crazy home-maker isn't that so gay if my dad is a home-maker i would personally die of shame that i have nothing else to about travesty but only word count them words to describe lame stupid and above all up all i could say folks it is definitely making my list of worst animated series ev-er if i had one that is
i don't know where to begin the cast is full of people who've never done anything before or since debralee scott is listed on cover boxes but does not appear in the movie at all the writing is quite bad even for college films obviously very low budget with one scene at the sorority house having extremely choppy characters are pretty typical for college films timid guy nerd suave black guy tough guys guy with mustache attractive girl small town girl etc the featured teacher is about you'd expect middle aged heavy set guy who gets sidetracked you wan't to see a college flick stay clear from this one so bad not even funny
about minutes in my wife was already wanting to leave not so much because of the material but the lack thereof they decided to fill in the blanks where the funny stuff should've been with as much language and absolutely vulgar talk as they could when this would let up rare we'd sit back and watch laughing mind you and wait for the next gross-out or offensive after about minutes we both got up and left everything we'd read said how great this was the trailer looked good and roger ebert actually called it intelligent and said it wasn't a crude sex comedy did he go to the right movie along with be cool the only other movie i've ever walked out i have no regrets i'm sick of trying to go see comedies in america
spoilers if such a thing is possible as a rabid robin williams fan i felt it necessary to buy this film as first on-screen appearance wow i could not imagine a more mind-numbing movie essentially the movie takes one bad joke after another that your uncle artie would tell you after dinner and dramatizes them robin williams plays a lawyer in a sec all for bawdy humor but this humor wasn't pleasantly vulgar or ribald it was just mind-numbing there are no redeeming qualities to this film other than robin williams fanatics like me who simply have to own every piece of film
i was enjoying this movie most of the time but i kept getting the feeling that i was watching a movie i honestly think that somebody wrote a pg script and then while filming decided to add in some blood nudity and language it was a big let down that believe the children magic that exists in movies like babe pig or angels in the outfield that defeats the evil tooth fairy the parents end up believing their daughter about her ability to see the ghost and utilize this skill to supernaturally defeat the tooth fairy when i bought this movie i thought it would be a b-film response to the dreadful darkness falls somehow manage to make a better film with of the money but they don't they made a worse film and will probably lose the same proportion of money lost on darkness falls
someone mentioned editing this is edited badly and what started out as somewhat intriguing became an incomprehensible mess for starters let us know what it is you are trying to do with these experiments why are these people the best choices for the type of experimenting they are involved in and what exactly are they testing apparently there is some grand plan that some agency is going to exploit the acting is pretty bad everyone is emoting everyone is keeping secrets they frequently mention that if it weren't for the money they'd hang it up a deranged minister who spouts scripture on and on but again the biggest hang up is the lack of laying out a playing field for the actors there are some really cheesy elements those little rooms and those chaise lounges the awful wallpaper it wallpaper it was interesting but didn't seem to go anywhere
redundant but again the case if you enjoy the former snl comedian and his antics this case schneider then you should go basic comedy life is saved by having various animal organs transplanted into him unfortunately he takes on each characteristics former survivor colleen looks pretty good here now that she doesn't have open sores on her legs and a little makeup on her face d
we loved school of rock and jack black we couldn't wait to go and see this movie it was the only time in my life the movie was so bad i wanted to walk out my husband hated it too the only funny parts were in the trailers my husband and i wanted to stand outside the movie theater and tell people to save their money the writing was awful it had every terrible stereotype of hispanic people who should be utterly offended the movie wasn't that long but to us it seemed like an eternity the people in the theater were so restless and silent it was like watching paint dry i made my husband stay because i was sure there would maybe be some redeeming parts but there weren't save you money and your time
the movie had a lot of potential unfortunately it came apart because of a story line miscasting and general lack of one of the very obvious flaws was that sean connery who played an arab man didn't know how to pronounce his own arab name this may seem a small flaw but it points to the seeming lack of effort in paying attention to details the quality of acting was uniformly well below average solitary saving grace was the twist in the plot at the very end and a french song don't recall the title overall it was a pretty bad movie where sean connery was visibly miscast
watching der himmel √ºber berlin as a teen in the late was a profound experience for me so this was what the movies could be along with paris texas and until the end of the world it still holds a special place in my heart and mind a testament to the genius of wim later years has seen a steady decline in the quality of his work with million dollar hotel and land of plenty hitting a terrible low point gone are the captivating pictures or music no search for or display of great insight all that is left are characters and thinly veiled political statements that boils down to nothing but clich√©s and quite frankly mock the intelligence of a mature the well run dry whatever the reason time for mr wenders to either step it up or stop altogether
one of the worst films i have ever had the displeasure of sitting through killer tongue is a horrible melange of the worst elements of the rocky horror picture show brain damage and pulp fiction designed primarily to offend apparently but so inane that only the most hidebound conservatives would be taken in by it
i'm actually watching this film as i write this if the following comments prove my lack of development as a true artistic film maker then so be it i thought still thinking as i'm presently viewing that this film to put it mildly is very very overrated again looks like a really really bad student film done by a someone with beyond extremely limited resources and who didn't pay that much attention to don't want to go on and on regarding all the different ways that i find this film lacking but well i just don't get it i fully admit that maybe me the idiot here not the film maker for not getting this piece of imaginative genius i rented this on a whim because the reviews were very very outstanding
when i saw the preview i thought this is going to be a great movie and indeed it could have been the actress playing the main character was very credible and the beauty of the filming is undeniable however the dialogues cast a dark shadow on the whole picture the level of language was too familiar and too contemporary for an action taking place in and it took away most of the magic of the film however i must congratulate the translator because the english sub-titles were more refined and appropriate that the original french cues and it probably explains the good rating the movie received on the imbd
oh my i decided to go out to the cinemas with some friends wanting to watch one of those mild feel-good christmas movies and i walk out disgusted the movie failed full-stop paul giamatti who i consider as a good actor played his character and roll just horribly along with vince vaughn who has always been a personal favourite of mine they try and turn a christmas movie into some new-style sort of bad mixed with good but it all turned out very wrong the first ten or so minutes weren't too bad but once we saw santa it was over it didn't get any better the rate stayed the same there was no character development and certainly is one of the worst christmas movies ever invented don't watch it whatever you do
in what i can say was a theft of my time i was taken to see this movie and i must say what a horrible experience fay ann lee is a terrible actress and is unconvincing in this movie is obviously a shill reviewer the plot is thin to say the least the cantonese dialog is not funny see this movie at your tang from shanghai tang should be after the movie for the little or no revenue this movie will generate the banal plot attempts to compete with other rom-coms out there and just blends into the scenery it was like watching paint dry short this movie was a total waste of time and space i've seen better movies on youtube
this is really a very bad movie why first of all the story is bad it is an artificial story combining all sorts of things together that make no sense it just seems a wrong experiment secondly the actors cannot play in a realistic manner they cannot even talk as an actor should why did i buy this movie and what must i do with it now
this movie was kind of had to watch it for a college class about india however the synopsis tells you this movie is about one thing when it doesn't really contain much cold hard information on those details it is not really true to the synopsis until the very end where they sloppily try to tie all the elements together the gore factor is superb however even right at the very beginning you want to look away because the gore is pretty intense only watch this movie if you want to see some cool gore because the plot is thin and will make you sad that you wasted time listening to it i've seen rumors on other websites about this movie being based on true events however you can not find any information about it basically this movie was a waste of time to watch
if utterly facile regressive self-indulgent anti-establishment anti-civilisation juvenilia appeals to you then this is the ideal film very poorly scripted with often inaudible dialogue and infuriatingly tiresome hand-held camera throughout this is a film that presents the world in appealingly simplistic manichean terms all adults teachers parents priests and doctors are insensitive and bumbling at best and predatory monsters at worst the only escape from the horrors of civilisation as a whole is plenty of primal screaming and infantile regression in a primitive cave-like space in the woods with utopia taking the form of a rave party again in the woods displays all the weaknesses of a first film and plenty more besides
this is not a horror film but a boring sex movie a very bad movie to be avoided by any serious horror fan no plot awful acting and annoying music if you only watch the trailer you will know enough a shame that such thing is available on vhs or video while there are so many good movies unavailable if you like vampires try the hammer productions or the italian gothic from mario bava and antonio margheriti instead those are masterpieces if you compare this with this trash rating even is too much and believe me i am not the only one with this opinion
i managed to sneak away one night and go to the movie theater to see this one thinking i was in for a treat boy was i wrong considering the talent involved this has to be one of the worst movies i've ever seen everyone in it was miscast and i find it incredible to read on this site that there are people out there who actually liked it
oh my god the idea that this movie is a thriller is an absolute joke to me besides the point that it seems to be written by a year old the plot the acting and even the props and filming of this movie were all beyond am not usually this critical about any movie cause every person has style but this movie however was probably the worst movie i have seen in i can honestly believe that this movie is unknown and i think it should stay like this for movies like these are making the thriller genre a advise anyone that is a fan of thriller movies or even simply movies to stay far away from this one
shoulda figured the dvd didn't even show the time or how long it was i thought wild cardz was the worst anime movie i'd ever seen this one is much worse makes no sense thrown together plot all so we can see oversized breasts on a figure that doesn't support them had to of been a student film that musta gotten a c entertainment i found out it wasn't going to end the ending made no darn
like most people i love a christmas story i had never even heard of this film and perhaps for good is awful same locale same narrator same director but the warm fuzziness of the original was lacking charles grodin was a poor choice to replace darrin mcgavin but i cannot imagine anyone being able to replace him the story seems forced and lacks the sweetness of the original the interaction with the neighbors the bumpuses is ridiculous in a christmas story obsession with the bb gun seems cute but his obsession in this movie is boring scud farkus the original neighborhood bully is replaced in this film by yet another kid with braces and a weird hat but with little of the scud farkus menacing appeal it would be pretty difficult to equal the original even if this movie had been made with the original crew
do i film gives manos the hands of fate and future war a run for their money as the worst film ever made this one is fun to laugh at where as manos was just painful to watch hobgoblins will end up in a time capsule somewhere as the perfect movie to describe the term cheeze the acting i am using this term loosely is atrocious the hobgoblins are some of the worst puppets you will ever see and the garden tool fight has to be seen to be believed the movie was the perfect vehicle for and that version is the only way to watch this mess this movie gives mike and the bots lots of ammunition to pull some of the funniest one-liners they have ever done if you try to watch this without the help of mike and the help you
i've got a question for those who thought of this idea why what made them think to make a second movie of this if memory serves didn't cinderella end with they all lived happily ever after i'm pretty sure it did or it was implied wait a minute if they all lived happily ever after how could there be a sequel unless they were trying to make the most boring story in history there couldn't be a sequel i mean sure they could have cinderella singing about nonsense for two hours but why a movie that ends in happily ever after can not have a sequel if it does then they don't live happily ever after got to go wrong which causes problems with the first ending why not right evil my final word on the matter
unentertaining uninvolving hybrid of cruel intentions and wild things but it isn't nearly as good as either of those trash min-classics about the acting sheriff artie diggs being called in to investigate a near-fatal drug overdose at a posh upper-class univesity but to keep it on the down low as he digs deeper he thinks much more than it at first glance seems to be we follow alicia the girl who overdosed in flashbacks as well at about minutes if this film was welcomed to begin with it would have worn it out this film brings absolutely nothing new to the table but it is the only movie thus far that has miss swain topless so the grade is higher just for grade candy dominique swain gets fixing a mistake of happy campers another girl is topless candy more men ass than girl tit
i saw this movie twice i can't believe pintilie made such a fantasy movie i'm also a director and i know what i speak this is not romania anymore but i see the events are happening in the same period with the incident from september no story no plot nothing no conclusion no message nothing profound nothing hidden just empty most of romanians don't know this movie is for the french viewers not for us they really believe that is the reality in romania also for teenagers pintilie should stop making movies i don't really know if we can call this a movie maybe a horror and we wonder why we've got such an image in europe this was a reality but isn't anymore a good friend of mine from the brithish embassy said you have no idea what a long way romanian people walked from ceausescu
in theodore rex poor whoopi goldberg is set up as a tough police cop who gets to work with a pathetic dinosaur on a case the movie tries to be funny and tries to make a story about abductions and more but it never works the movie is far from funny and the story is ridiculous i voted
with the other episodes in this made-for-tv series expanding on the many adventures of the sea legend horatio super human infallibility ruins all chance for little wesley crusher ruined many seasons of the next generation horatio hornblower invincibly saves every situation each and every clever solution inevitably comes only from the lips of horatio hornblower immeasurably superior main trouble in this movie series seems to be tolerating the many error ridden characters above and below him in the chain of command a perfect being makes for dull story telling so superior is our hero that even those who attempt to help him are powerless to do something correctly unless hornblower is there to direct and control their every is the sense in telling a story about any person who cannot do wrong and will repeatedly win at everything every single time what is the point of watching such a story
dane tries to hard and is to extreme with all of his yelling and going crazy spilling water on himself and rolling on the floor to much calm down get yourself together and make us laugh i didn't quite understand his comparison toward comics and rock stars just because there both up on stage or something he said that every comedian wants to be a rock star i'm sure rodney dangerfield was really into that when he was alive he had a few good jokes like the burger king joke where people yell at the drive thru i also liked the pieces joke if dane just didn't act so mental he might be funnier and i might have given this a higher rating as high as maybe an eight
complete waste of time this movie is not comedy not drama not even teenage comedy at least story it should be some turn-over one end but so disappointing when movie has a turn-over on end i expect that turn-over to make movie even better fight club but this turn-over makes movie even worse when i watch teenage comedy and i don't do that very often i expect lousy jokes and bunch of nudeness jokes are too lousy and there is no nudity you got only good looking i must admit girl and that and fully dressed whole movie acting is bad like soap series don't waste your time there are porns with better story and on my bad english
after buying the dvd in a bargain bin due to the impressive amount of features listed on the cover i popped it in the dvd player and everything looked good nice animated menus and a whole lot of extra when i played the movie itself what a let down it is the worst thing i have ever seen and i have seen some bad movies in my time the comment that praises the movie here at imdb is actually from the people who made the film so don't believe it unless you like to waste your cash
although the beginning suggests all quiet on the western front this silly and superficial version of war falls far astray of its much better contemporary this depicts the funnest war ever fought with the first hour and a half devoted to romance and good we finally see some battle it is lame an enemy plane flies over shoot it down one shot sniper in the tree kill him before he gets a shot off enemy soldiers in the woods not to worry they gladly surrender turgid
it is such a strange movie you can call it awful or if you sit with friends it can give you a killer laugh-athon strange comes to mind again and again shot amateurishly acted even worse and the directions maybe none the special effects are funny but the music accompanying a flying demon baby will surely be the biggest hit see it if you got time to kill but don't don't even try to take it seriously supposed to be a tribute to porno holocaust since i haven't seen it from the tribute i can assume it to be as bad should have given it but it did give me a good laugh or two so it gets a excessive gore the only thing somebody worked on stay away if you are squeamish more gore than laughs wonder if the makers had a laugh making it
do not be suckered into renting this movie it has nothing to do with an escape from death row despite the title i can't think of a single good thing to say about the movie poor acting poor editing poor directing laughable plot and the was so irritating a wonder this movie doesn't come with a warning label the only possible way to sit through this movie and enjoy it is for historical cheesiness quality they just don't make films this bad anymore
as much as i love rodney dangerfield this was a terrible movie the plot was kind of a holistic rip off of various movies but unfortunately they forgot to rip off any good jokes in addition it was annoying and boring and being kind if you're looking for a good laugh rent a copy of private parts
for all the subtle charms this student film may contain was anyone else bored to death waiting wendingo to show his paper macho anti-climax pretty much ruined any sort of momentum we had speed actioned to get me wrong i'm all into exploring dark underbelly but this is a turd-a-flamb√© that gets a nod to watchable only for the fact that looks hot taking from a guy from best minutes the film has to you felt like ripping off deliverance you could do better
if i could have rated this movie by i would have i see some ppl at imdb says that this is the funniest movie of the year etc etc excuse me are you ppl snorting lsd or there is absolutely nothing funny about this movie n o t h i n g i actually want my minutes back of my life that i spent watching this piece of crap read someone sitting on an airplane watching this movie stopped watching after minutes i totally understand that i actually would have watched snakes on a plane for times over instead of watching this movie once not watch this movie do something else useful with your life do the dishes walk the dog hell anything is better than spending time in front of the tv watching hot rod
i can find very little thats good to say about this film i am sure the idea and script looked good on paper but the filmography and acting i am afraid is not the standards i would expect from some very talented people i would doubt that this features highly in their cv filmography michael caine appeared wooden at times in his role as the doctor and at no time no did i actually believe in his character the plot was unbelievable especially with regard to the victims son some of the scenes were very reminiscent of other films that at times i wondered if it was actually a spoof thriller the lighting at times was dark and this added to the feeling of watching a low budget movie with some big named stars wondering why i bothered to watch it at all
christopher guest need not worry his supreme hold on the mockumentary sub-genre is not in trouble of being upstaged in the least especially not by this extremely unfunny jab at rpg-gamers the jokes are beyond lame not enough substance to last the typical length of a rancid snl skit much less the atrocious minutes i waisted watching this drivel the great william katt american hero house deserves much much better one thing and one thing alone makes the fact that i saw this worth it in my mind and posting about it on here so hopefully just hopefully i'll save someone such a bad grade extras audio commentaries interviews with various cast members deleted scenes theatrical trailer extras wallpapers egg highlight the eye in the picture on the main menu for a short scene
a remake of the superb movie of the stage play nicely casting caine as the nemesis of his character from the first movie but doing nothing else nicely at under-parr performance from the actors law and caine diluted further by weak self-indulgent warmth of the setting in the original is forsaken for a super-modern homesetting the subtle interplay between oliver and caine which made the first movie so watchable is replaced with a horrid brash arrogance that instantly breeds disdain in the viewer but this is not the clever to-ing and froing of liking one then the other character the original fostered so well this is an obvious ott character assassination of both character from the word version of sleuth is not really worth seeing watch the original film and be dazzled from the opening act
if you make it through the opening credits this may be your type of movie from the first screen image of a woman holding her hands up to her face with white sheets blowing in the background one recalls a pretentious perfume commercial all downhill from lead actress is basically a block of wood who uses her computer to reach into the past and reconstruct the memories of photographs to talk overlooked genius ada who conceived the first computer language in the low budget graphics would be forgivable if they were interesting or even somewhat integral to the tilda swinton is wasted
they changed the title of this atrocity to an unexpected love the only thing worse is the film itself the script contains dialogue that would be laughed out of a third grade play recital at one point when the wife leaves the husband a bad cover of all by myself plays over the soundtrack no kidding the actors try but are defeated by the inept unbelievably terrible script direction is staggeringly bad no wonder lifetime has such a bad reputation how do things like this get made i'm turning off the television before over
this should be a great film meryl streep and jack nicholson co-starring as two newspaper writers mike nichols directing uh uh dull dull dull pointless and predictable slow and a cookie cutter boy meets girl boy marries girl boy has affair girl leaves boy story now theres an original concept after squirming through two hours it only two it felt like wasn't sure whether it was a comedy a romance a tragedy or a soap opera it was done in i'm sure all of us did things sixteen years ago that we rather would forget i hope the damage to the reputations of streep et al is beginning to heal and that the emulsion on the master is beginning to fade not that such a bad picture just that such an un-good one
in one instant when it seemed to be getting interesting it never got people are going from one point to another point with really no point there was one it was very dull there was no action suspense or any horror and the characters were pretty heartless so there was no caring what happened to together the movie was pretty give it a like that it wasn't shaky choppy camera-work and if there was music it didn't annoy me like some really bad movies and the acting was not horrendous
there really wasn't much of a story in this film it loosely based itself off the events in the first lion king movie it is supposed to be how timon and pumbaa met via their aloneness but there isn't much more than mixes some scenes from the original then it ab-libs about how this movie changed them a little bit but still is that it i was hoping for something a little more instead all i have to show for it is an empty plot with little guess if you wanted to see other meerkats in the lion king universe then this is it but other than that it does little justice for the animators disney really should stop these direct-to-video productions it really was quite boring and could have used jason statham
yikes did this movie blow the characters were weak the plot weaker i figured this couldn't be too bad because it has christoper walken oops he must have done this because he was bored and needed the money the characters were supposed to be irish but noone had an irish accent i am desperately trying to find something nice about this i can't except walken did a fine job with a wooden character find something to read or watch discovery don't ever see this movie
an absolutely wretched waste of film nothing ever happens no ghosts hardly any train no mystery no interest the constant and brutal attempts at comedy are painful everything else is pathetic the premise is idiotic a bunch of people stranded in the middle of no-place because their train was held up for less than minutes what and the railroad leaves them no place to stay in a heavy storm i think not oh they can walk miles across the dead-black fields umm yeah sure or they can force themselves on the hospitality and stay at the haunted train station a station which proved to be nothing but deadly boring utterly without ghosts interest or very terribly dull that this seems ought to be added to the lost films list aargh
i was really disappointed with this film the first waters movie i saw was serial mom and i loved it then i saw pecker and i loved it then i watched polyester and really sort of hated it the only thing i liked about that movie was divine had a hell of a lot of talent i was truly surprised as a whole i wouldn't recommend this film
i screamed my head off because seeing this movie was my first movie going experience ever at some months old i remember it being incredibly bloody and it made me angry i watched it again on tv a few years ago big mistake the acting is wooden the plot non-existent and the movie lacks merit unless year-old t a is what gets you going
dooohhh my bwainn hurrrts well it certainly does after this endurance test of a film how on earth i managed to keep going without hitting the fast forward button lord only knows i don't get the premise of the film or maybe i don't appreciate alleged mystical atmosphere in my humble opinion though the film has about as much mystical atmosphere as a trip to addition the characters were all dreadful and there is more character development in a tom jerry cartoon yaarrrghhh why do i do it why do i watch such tripe enough to make one run away and join a monastery or the foreign legion yaargh an absolutley dreadful film in just about every respect apart from that not to bad
don't expect much from this film in many ways this film resembles a film that doris day starred in in julie in this film was a flight those the air craft after her derange by louis jordan shot the captain she did a far better kim took control of a and manage to land it without much help from the control tower i know a little about use to be a flight attendant myself like i not expect much from this was done on a cheap budget the producers were to cheap to use a plane with the name of a airline on it oceanic is one name that several movies have used the only writing on this plane was the name of the company that made the aircraft
this is what happens when you're living in china and the local video store is running thin on english-language are blessed with this work of what appears to be yes romanian cinema nevertheless i think that it has real comedic technically i don't think that it would in fact spoil viewing pleasure to ask why a film set in a casino has a scene of beach archery even in flashback that mystery and many other conundrums remain to be exploited by desperate comedians perhaps when they're stuck in me also wonder aloud why perfectly good-looking people allow themselves to abuse themselves on film like this sad
incredibly muddled off-putting and ultimately ludicrous horses oh my god the horses thriller creepy at times but it has one of the worst scripts ever written for a horror film watch how in the final minutes everybody magically does exactly what the plot needs for the resolution to occur bland performances by the leads a typically eccentric one by richard lynch the video transfer is a real hack job cutting scenes in half and making the movie even more difficult to understand out of stars
i can see the guys doing the budget preparation for this flick well lets see now we spend getting dirk benidict cause battle star galactic and the a-team were cool the we spend making a demon costume never mind that the demon is supposed to be incorporeal in the script and we spend the rest making the movie this was pretty bad and very cliche have a loved one present when watching bring a good book
watching kroko i would have liked to leave the cinema very much for the first time in my life i would not recommend to watch this movie flat main characters absolutely no development kroko the metaphoric german problem child remains a pure metaphor without any capability of positive involvement despite several plot-wise chances to do so uninspired actors non-evolving plot i guess the movie attempted an environmental survey but did not succeed camera appeared shaky rather than motivated pictures were low contrast gray and dark i am sure deliberately but the components did not add up to a convincing impression of the social milieu the story had certain potential though it could have made a good short story
stupid stupid stupid i can not stand ben stiller anymore how this man is allowed to still make movies is beyond me i can't understand how this happens if i performed at work the way he acts in a movie i'd get fired and i own the would have to fire myself god this movie was just a plain steaming stinking pile of poo that needs to be vapoorized if that were possible something else i have to say the guideline about lines of text in a comment is idiotic what is wrong with just saying a few things about a movie i will never understand why sites will require a short novel written when sometimes a brief comment is all that is necessary
we gave up at the point where george character has his finger-nails extracted we were not squeamish having sat through an hour of this drivel we just knew what it felt like to say this film was incomprehensible boring pretentious twaddle would be to over-praise it how did people manage to sit through this confusing slow depressing corner of a film let alone nominate it for an oscar clooney looked as ill as we felt watching him what was he thinking oh and what was with those subtitles did we just have a dud dvd or was the original film done like that sentences left hanging in mid-air the film was hard enough to follow without that as well i pity the cast who obviously did their best with the material available
mighty morphin power rangers has got to be the worst television show ever made there is no plot just a bunch of silly costumed kids using martial arts while dressed up in second class spandex special effects look like they are from the the costumes look like something out of a bad comedy and the show is just plain only thing worse than the television show are the toys just second rate plastic garbage fed to our are far better shows for your kids to giving your kids something like nickelodean those shows actually have some intelligence behind them unlike power rangers
this film is so much of a rip-off of the masterpeice demons and thats the only thing that makes the movie worth watching the acting is action scenes are speeded script is almost painful and budget non you think this film is good then you havn't seen a real horror film skip this and get a copy of the movie demons
pure crap and the other was a brief moment where i thought the blond chick was going to disrobe dialogue was legendarily bad the action sucked and there was no sex afore mentioned blond chick is modestly dressed alas the whole movie the cgi had the dubious honor of being the worst i've ever seen on film and the anachronisms were numerous and glaring acting was mediocre even from ben cross and marina sirtis the only names in this movie and marina sirtis looked really really seen high school plays more capably produced this is the kind of movie that thrived on heads should roll at sci-fi for allowing this steaming pile on the air
seeing a photo of a man being attacked by zombies gave me hope that lucio zombi fulci might be up to his old tricks unfortunately other than the close ups of a rotting corpse little to recommend in this story of the murder of a wealthy man and his quest to figure out who killed him none of the characters are appealing and by the time you find out how they did it twist at least was cool you stop caring the only good thing i can say is that it made more sense than nightmare concert
there is not a speck of entertainment in this entire film not one scary funny or even interesting scene in this film it advertises itself as a horror then goes on to call itself a comedy it doesn't even attempt humor neither does it attempt to be order to not be bored by this film you would have to be one of the most easily entertained people on earth if you like this movie even a little bit than you have no standard for what you watch at all i'm having a very difficult time trying to understand what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish with this its not funny scary shocking or intriguing so was it supposed to be a drama because it really wasn't dramatic just do yourself a favor and don't watch this film life is too precious to be wasting minutes of it watching this
i watched this movie on march this say much better than is about prabhat who lives with his and his little movie opens when he saves a jhurhad makes a plot to kill his young makes a plan by sending few come to a school pretended to be prabhats that father throws him out of the later comes and aakash go to kenya to find gives a good was annoying at is did was was wasted but looked kid which played sunnys brother in the movie was sad he had to get his character girl was cute but was other kid did did was and gulshan did cinematography is excellent in both india and is weak but has a few good drags the music was only liked one samundar the lyrics of that song was other songs were watch this
spike lee has been in a decline since his early successes and this mess does nothing to help i looked at my watch frequently hoping the movie would end or get to the point first movie with an all-white cast is a major the point that italians swear and like funky sex but not with their wives if i wanted to see scorsese i'd go to a scorsese movie the incredibly lame godfather character only adds to the admired several of films especially do the right thing this movie is a waste of time
really when it comes down to it this movie is just not funny josh kornbluth is the antithesis of funny and yet he thinks hilarious the plot about mailing the letters was fine at first until look at me i'm wacky approach began infesting each and every scene the judas priest joke may have been the least funny thing i have ever been privy to and that is saying quite a bit since it does have stiff competition from all the other jokes in the movie and as for the incredible overuse of the pixies debaser i have just one thing to say what did the pixies ever do to deserve a fate like this what did anyone do to josh kornbluth to cause him to in such a terrible movie
as a turkish man now living in sweden i must confess i often watch scandinavian movies most if them i never understand i think actors from scandinavia work best in hollywood last week i watched a film called the polish wedding together with a polish friend of mine and we both said it was the worst movie we ever watched unfortunately i was wrong this movie house of angels is even worse none of the actors can act absolutely not the female so called star helen bergstrom the plot is so silly nobody can believe think the whole thing is a mess from the start lots of bad acting except from selldal and wollter ahmed sellam
i was expecting a b-movie french musical after all dh√©ry blanche defun√®s were superstars of low budget french films of that time and it is in color but i have hallucination in this unbelievable one hour of pure mediocrity musical numbers are awful and comedy is absolutely boring and stupid and the songs what songs this is just a succession of bad numbers one after another the only one very rare thing about that thing is the nudity of women it was not familiar at that time in fact some numbers are just there to show us topless women it adds to the mediocrity and try to find young michel serrault the future great actor of french cinema in a bit part as a musician in his very first movie good luck
as i was watching this movie i was it'll get good any was wrong the real best part of this movie was when it was over a complete waste of minutes all seriousness aside the best part was when the wendigo finally showed up which was at the end and you couldn't really even see him that good and the tail end was really kind of dumb as well there was too many sections in the movie where you thought something was going to happen but was a let down the worse part is there was more talk of the wendigo then there was wendigo for the creature to be so definitely couldn't tell it by this movie
recipe for one of the worst movies of all time a she-male villain who looks like it escaped from the wwf has terrible aim with a gun that has inconsistent effects first guy she shoots catches on fire but when she shoots anyone else they just disappear and takes time out to pet a deer then you got the unlikable characters year old college students a lame attempt at a surprise ending and lots lots more avoid at all costs
i opted to see the film at the recent dubai film festival because it had been selected to the cannes film prestigious competition section i was surprised that cannes could be so off the mark in judging film some reviewers have noted does not have too much of the inherent violence is repulsive imagine killing your in front of your young forcing someone to eat a porcelain spoon to prove loyalty there are some hints of the contrasting corleone sons in godfather that seem to resurface here in this kong film but the quality of the two are as distinctly different as chalk and film is only recommended for violence is no great cinema here at best it might be considered to be better than the usual run run shaw production for production values
i was rooting for this film as a remake of a tv series escape into night which though chaotic and stilted at times was definitely odd fascinating and disturbing the acting in paperhouse is wooden unintentionally a joke the overdubs didn't add tension they only reinforced that i was sat watching a botch casting exasperated the dreary dialogue which resulted in relationships lacking warmth chemistry or conviction as in most lacklustre films there are a few good supporting acts these people should be comforted consoled and reassured that they will not be held responsible out of all the possible endings the most unexpected was chosen lamer than i could have into night deserves a proper remake written by someone with life experience and directed with a subtle mind
ok first of all let me say that i'm still amazed of how the plot than again its a movie that sequels a steven segal movie only with no steven segal random low budget action scenes really no point i m still amazed i burned min on this crap really rent a jacky chan movie or go see wwf more fun and has no and presume not to have and plot plz plz plz avoid it btw the best actor playing there is bill goldberg and that says a no he doesn't play very well like i said plz avoid it pfff i still cant believe i wasted min and spent min more writing this
after chaplin made one of his best films dough dynamite he made one of his worst gentlemen of nerve during this first year in films chaplin made about a third of all his films many of them were experimental in terms of ad-libbing editing gags location shooting etc this one takes place at a racetrack where chaplin and his friend try to get in without paying mabel normand is there with her friend also and chaplin manages to rid himself of both his and friends he then woos mabel in the grandstand with no apparent repercussions from his behavior lots of slapstick in here but there is very little else to recommend this film for other then watching chaplin develop the print i saw was badly deteriorated which may have affected its enjoyment charley chase can be glimpsed of stars
this is one of the most atrocious rewrites i've ever viewed if they want to make a movie with a lousy story they should refrain from giving it a title of a fine book there is hardly a relation between book and this movie other than the title i don't mind changes if they help a story flow on screen at least the changes shouldn't hurt the final product the last scene in the movie is painfully unconvincing the actors are miscast the director screen writer obviously could not decide whether to make a lame comedy or preach an unconvincing you've seen this movie and disliked it try the book if you've seen this movie and liked it read the book
if in the first minutes of this film you don't realize that the main character who writes a life advice column is going to have the tables-oh-so-cleverly-turned and learn some valuable life lessons himself then there is probably something wrong with you the set up is so predictable as to ruin the movie even if the rest of the movie was good it isn't almost no chemistry between the leads and steve stalker-ish behavior is embarrassing not funny hard to believe character would have any interest in him then in the end all wrapped up so wonderful and everyone lives happily ever after isn't that great america
difficult to call the grudge a horror movie at best it made me slightly jump from surprise at a couple of one forgets the frightening dimension and looks at other sides of the movie he is again disappointed the acting is ok but not great the story can be somewhat interesting at the beginning while one is trying to get happening but toward the end one understands there is not much to understand scary elements seems sometimes to have been added to the script without see this movie it if you have nothing more interesting to do like cutting the carrots or looking at the clouds
i appreciate a think positive feel good about yourself film but this is too much in the end they look like a bunch of loonies this film is one of those finding yourself plots i know the film is made in a lot more of clint and girl friend movie this movie is a
i would have given it a one instead of a two but i suppose it could have been worse i guess the acting isn't all that bad but the plot lacks anything even remotely close to interesting it is a terrible movie terrible complete waste of time i strongly suggest you do not watch this movie
wow what a terrible adaptation of a beautiful novel here are just a few gripes the screenwriter eliminated two major characters from the book plot has been grotesquely altered voiceovers sound as if they were directly lifted from written passages may read well but are not the same when spoken especially with writing style the acting is more wooden than a log cabin bechstein this is supposed to be set in feels more like be fair i couldn't bring myself to finish watching this movie so possible that it redeemed itself i truly hope that no one paid to see this or at least anyone who read the book hoping for something decent la wonder boys i like chabon as a writer but he should be ashamed of this stars
this movie is horrible it rivals ishtar in the number of embarrassingly bad moments i would have rated it lower than a save for a couple of funny lines but overall this film was crap it looked like they made it over a weekend at some bankrupt resort somewhere joe roth should join elaine may on the directing sidelines forever
filmed in a documentary style but you can pretty well tell participants had been coached a recently divorced wannabe film a chance to liven up his love life and step into the movie biz at the same time he intends to make a documentary piece about finding love by filming twenty dates including ramifications the comedy is spotty at best the rest is mishap after mishap also taking part are richard arlook robert mckee and the enticing elisabeth wagner trying for credibility the fetching tia carrere is talked into a cameo this will suffice as a handbook on how not to get a satisfactory date
believe it or movie is worse than number acting is the story is very isn't a lot of good to say about this the fight scenes are more dull than number i would have thought that is a very slow stuck it it would get you really want to see this should try to find a cheap rental of is hard to probably for good number movie has nothing to do with the first is the same in name most i can give best of the warning is
i rented this film just to see amber benson though after reading the box i thought it sounded like a good the first problem was that there really wasn't a actually there was a story but it made absolutely no sense the second problem was there was no set up for these i got that they all went to school together but within the first minutes of the film you realized they had nothing else in common and didn't like each why did they keep getting together flaw number director though long pauses and tight camera shots equaled suspense with the typical suspense music dubbed was sadly mistaken it was painful to watch a terrific actress like amber benson waste time trying to bring this back to only hope is the money she made here was put toward producing her own film
i really didn't expect much from this film seeing as it has people from parkersburg wv which is were i live acting in it this town is dull and so is this film there were a few decent scened in the movie but i was distracted by all the crappy landmarks they made a point to show this movie may have been good if there was actual acting in it but there wasn't any unless you are from parkersburg and are interested in seeing what you see everyday then stay away from this movie the dialog will put you to sleep the acting will bore you to tears and steven soderberg should lose some credibility after shooting crap like this its a predictable movie with no surprises what you see is what you get and that is a minute tour of parkersburg west virginia and belpre ohio without a narrator
this was a new alltime low among westerns the writing is excruciatingly bad characters are impossible to emphasize with and are either disgusting or bland the violence is appalling and technically not very convincingly executed and tobey maguire shows us the flip side of his talent sleepwalking through his part with those expressionless eyes and that raspy voice of his that here betrays only mannerism ride with the devil is among my five worst movie experiences ever a western never to be surpassed in the negative respect
the main character lance barton gets killed and to heaven before his time when heaven learns about the mistake he is given the body of just deceased rich old and white mr young black guy in a old white mans body still behaving like the young black man is maybe funny if you see it done by an old white actor in this movie i ended up reminding myself several times chris rock is supposed to be an old white whole concept does not play as intended the illusion is not transported well and the love story is not believable at all the fact that all you see is chris rock playing a young black guy because the old white person everyone is supposed to see is only shown in small scenes is to much of a challenge for the viewers suspension of disbelief
utterly pretentious nonsense the material is dull dull dull and most of the cast wouldn't even have made understudies in earlier films and to have to listen to the unfunny will ferrell do his woody allen imitation makes me loathe the second-rate mysteriously popular ferrell even more it appears that the morose old allen should have knocked off work when the clock rang in a new truly tried to get involved in the film but it was just impossible my snyapses couldn't fire that slowly so rather than doze off and kill the afternoon sleeping in an upright position i got up left my wife and daughter in the theater and went out to the car where i had a really good book to re-read great tome of years ago germans the day turned out pretty well after all no thanks to woody
wow what can i say i like shity movies and i go out of my way to watch a corny action flick but snake eater i would have rather had a nail driven into my pee hole while my grandma gave me a lap dance lorenzo lamas pfft more like lorenzo lameass this guy has as much acting ability as bill clinton has self control it has all the goods to make a really bad movie even worse crazed hillbilles yep needless tit shot a real weird scar yep crappy soundtrack yep i wish i could give the movie stars but is as low as it goes seriously i think someone was playing a joke on me when i saw this it cant be real the worse thing there is snake eater movies guess its in demand
van damme what else can i say bill goldberg there we go now we know this movie is going to be really saw the first five minutes of this movie on tbs knowing it would be bad but not even i thought it would be this bad the plot is awful van damme is getting old but unlike arnold his movies are as this movie don't see it ever i wouldn't even be paid to see this stars at its heart lies a wonderful action-packed thrill well maybe not but the marketers would sure like us to think so wouldn't ulmer
i tried to watch this movie three separate times the night i rented it got through about minutes hoping it would be better if i had a rest watched more the next day almost vomited at how stupid it was it wasn't even funny stupid which is sometimes a fun movie to watch but this movie was just crap with a capital s you know what i mean in the censored world we live in and finally on the third day i watched over an hour of the dumb thing and i didn't enjoy one single moment not even one how did this script get greenlighted oh the one is for cheerleaders they deserve at least something for all their hardwork
this movie was billed as a comedy and a mystery it fails badly at both the only mystery here is why would anybody make such a poorly constructed movie the only comedy is the laugh i got when i saw how high the readers here ranked it could there be two movies with the same name the movie i saw starred a girl with pretty blue eyes and a plot that wasn't
i usually don't comment anything read the others opinions but this this one i to comment i was convinced do watch this movie by worlds like action and other hi-tech stuff but by only few first minutes and i changed my mind lousy acting lousy script and a big science one of the worst movies i have ever don't one more thing before any movie i usually check user comments and rating on this site points and i give this movie a try now i'm wondering who rate this movie by giving it more than points
this movie is so stupid it simply goes around the corner and becomes ridiculous i wanted to watch darkness falls actually and thought that this was the movie boy what a mistake i fast-forwarded as much as i could and still i couldn't get rid of the boring moments i just envy the people who was paid to play in or work on this movie they were actually given money for this crap isn't that amazing i mean in this movie a man gets killed and chopped in a wood-grinder to little bloody pieces and few minutes later the mother and the kid talk calmly at the table as nothing happened and drink coffee please come on who gives money for such crap movies oh and the tooth-fairy was lame not scary at all and was obvious that it is a bored stuntman wearing a badly made make-up
i was one of the few non-liberals who showed up to see video it was quite an experience in propaganda film-making and was hoping the film might be an actual documentary of michael visit to my local school uvsc but it turned out to be another liberal slash-and-burn effort to slam conservatives and the local religious community it sure seems self-serving for a filmmaker to make a documentary that only reflects his preconceptions on more surprising is to see all the votes his homeys have posted here did they even see the video golly gee batman this must rank with all the men their ratings are as obvious as the bias in this film like stacking the votes at imdb will help a lame movie maybe my vote will help balance this out
argh this film hurts my head and not in a good just my growing hatred for the action genre but even as a kid when i would swallow tripe like navy seals i still regarded this film with dislike now i utterly despise one fairly good fast-paced story keep the title and throw the rest away instead use some half-assesd future gladiators storyline thats so full of plot holes the whole things in danger of collapsing is there a rebel base in the middle of the arena what about the cameras why have clearly marked footage of what really happened at bakersfeild in an unguarded whole film screams eighties from the truley awful score to the goofy shiny costumes watch this film i know some people liked it but some people get off on being peed on and i don't understand them either
unless you are an evangelical christian then make like an egyptian and avoid like the biblical why oh why does imdb list the most favourable reviews at the top of the list it was due to one of these that i have just wasted the end of what started out as good evening on this plot premise started out strong enough i was drawn into the film and was interested right up to the point where the bible sermons took over what a film has so incensed me that i have registered with imdb for the first time just to complain about it i hope at least that by doing so i save someone what a christian act on my part
oh dear jerry may be the undisputed king of talkshow but the movies are a whole different ball game and way out of his league the script for this film is so poor it has to be seen to be believed and its sad to see such vaguely familiar actors as michael dudikoff action king michael jai white seen in the sci fi flop as well as surviving the games william macnamara is involved in the only half funny situation in the whole film stoop this low for employment if you are a fan of jerry then stick to his tv show as this is a total waste of and hour and a half after i had finished sitting through this i managed to catch the last half an hour of rocky on tv which looked like a cinematic masterpiece in comparison i think that says more than
the omega code was a model of cinematographical inconsistency there was a bit precious little of good acting primarily by the two prophets and rostenberg who only appeared once and had no lines otherwise the acting was decidedly bad the plot line was rather weak and only partially based on already questionable biblical interpretation certainly not one of the best
admittedly i watched this piece with already very low expectations dieter bohlen is a rather untalented composer parvenu whose lack of talent is only surpassed by the size of his was the first cartoon movie that i watched that was per cent humor free it is rude offensive redneck and blatantly women as such it is a creation befitting bohlen but the average viewer will be rather put off by it no wonder that it was never shown in a cinema theater it would've bombed big even the expense of megaeuros were able to save this utter piece of crap save your time and money
this was a cute movie until the ending the ending was merely one more despicable effort to emasculate men and empower women at their expense the girl refused to listen to reason and logic and used her nature to control and impose her will on the guy who ultimately yielded his power and control over the relationship to her it is not by chance that she was sitting behind the wheel in the car as they drove away at the end after he had to beg her and plead with her to take him back this movie is a victory for all women who think they should be in charge of all men and in control of their relationships with them it was a despicable movie for that reason
this is one of the worst movies ever made trite predictable only thing that rated one point was there was a few nice scenes highlighting barcelona i imagine they would use films like this in guantanamo or some other hidden prison to torture bad movies have some redeeming features this has nothing if i was in it or worked on it i would change my name truly a turd hard to write more than this but i feel the film watchers needed a up on this on the other hand it will make a great gift for people you can't could send it to politicians you dislike in laws ex-wives teachers you hated former employees dick cheney w and a host of others
this movie was the most out of line and liberally fed movie i have ever seen in my life farenheit all of the information was only supported on the opinion of five scientists while of the asssociated press highly criticize the science promoted be gore global warming is a mass media hysteria and nothing more most of the information in the movie was either misquoted or it was wrong all together this movie has been investigated over and over again and has been shown evidence against that prove its lies were nothing but blindness an to think that they show this in school proves that the media has brainwashed us into believing this garbage
i wasn't particularly impressed by this movie that has lackluster music and only lasts minutes thank god because i was falling asleep i makes excellent use of time lapse photography to display the passage of time in the movement of light and shadow people water clouds etc unfortunately all it preference is for its predecessor the excellent koyaanisqatsi made in at minutes and to prove that a sequel can be better than the original powaqqatsi made in running them both
this is a typical perfect crime thriller a perfect crime is executed and the investigating police officer ignoring all the clues immediately knows who guilty is the audience has to wait around the whole movie for the guilty to be caught the result is like every single episode of columbo or murder she wrote the director himself refers to the hackney story by showing the police officer watching an episode of matlock this story barely fills up minutes but the director insists on using all minutes filling with every cliche in the book skip this one you are not missing anything
i saw this film last night following a lot of good reviews from many sources i would like to point out that if your not ready to try and work out continuously who is who and what it all means you will hate this am still struggling to understand the roles of the actors in this film the film jumps from different stories and does not allow you to really empathise with any of the the political and those interested in corruption in other world governments out there this film is probably quite good but to the average movie watcher this film is boring in places and you will leave the cinema confused and annoyed that you paid the entrance it if your ready to focus on every minute detail or politics interest you don't see it if you actually like watching films
film version of sandra one-woman off-broadway show is gaspingly pretentious sandra spoofs lounge acts and superstars but her sense of irony is only fitfully interesting and fitfully funny her fans will say scathingly honest and that may be true but also shrill with an unapologetic in-your-face bravado that isn't well-suited to a film in this genre she doesn't want to make certainly not out to make always going to rub a lot of people the wrong way but even if you meet her halfway her material here is seriously lacking filmmaker nicolas roeg served as executive producer and though not directed by him the film does have his chilly detached signature style all over it bernhard co-wrote the show with director john boskovich their oddest touch was in having all of in-house audiences looking completely feeling many real viewers will most likely share from
movie was the purpose of filming this remake from turning it into a informercial for the soundtrack zombies that i guess the director never watched the original dead films which show stiff-limbed rigor mortis creatures toward their living how exactly did the survivors know which boat in the marina belonged to the recently departed
chilly alienating adaptation of rebecca book about an army captain returning from duty in wwii with his memory impaired an original idea it seems he remembers old flame glenda jackson but not current wife julie christie which should be enough to set off some emotional sparks this extremely well-cast soaper brings together leading man alan bates with director alan bridges and co-stars jackson christie ann-margret and ian holm but the burners are all on low there are a handful of good scenes whenever jackson is on-screen but bridges pacing is unrelievedly sluggish and the dulled-out color is enervating long on the shelf this soldier is best left forgotten from
a family of terrible people must remain in a house for a week or else they will lose their inheritance which will go to the servants who will only get their inheritance if they agree to stay on and keep the house in order people die so will you if you try to sit through this if you've ever had any desire to see bad many with ill fitting dentures-act or attempt to act in a bad horror movie this is your chance this is just awful its so bad i thought al adamson one of the worst directors ever directed it but i was so bad i don't want to say anything more about it not because it isn't polite but because once i start i may not be able to
for die-hard judy garland fans only there are two numbers that are really good one where she does a number with an older cleaning lady all seen the pics and a pretty good number at the very end there are a couple of scenes where the lines are funny but basically the script is so bad and the movie so dated that hard not to cringe at the awfulness throughout but worth the to rent the movie just be prepared to fast-forward it
trigger man is definitely the most boring and silliest movie i've ever seen in my life my holiday videos are more actors seem to be recruited at they do not have any talent to act in a convincing walk and walk and walk through the forest more walking-around than in all three parts of the lord of the rings together after the first hour i began to read a porsche brochure while watching trigger man along the way total waste of time and money i'd give that movie stars out of since this is not possible i have to give star
this film is a massive yawn proving that americans haven't got the hang of farce even when it has already been written for them the original film hodet over vannet is a witty comedy of errors that i would rate it isn't just about a linguistic translation but certain absurd chains of events are skipped entirely robbing the film of its original clever farcical nature and turning it into a cheap oops there go my trousers style of farce
i hate to even waste the time it takes to write lines on this atrocity hyung-rae shim is lucky that bad film-making isn't a capital crime or he'd be put to death twice for writing and directing this disaster i'm amazed that this film had a budget but actually glad in the sense that it was such a tremendous flop that shim will hopefully never get to make another movie the rest of the life and therefore not waste any more of filmgoers time i would think the actors would have gotten together and lynched him by the effects resources available to them a great film could have been made with this budget as usual the failure should have been spotted at the very beginning with the terrible script and story transformers was another visual feast with a weak script but this makes it look like citizen kane
when it comes to movies i am generally easily entertained and not very critical but must say that this movie was one big flop from the start i gave it minutes and then rewound it what a waste of some great talent i was very disappointed with this movie as it was not what i expected
this film is pretty awful the only thing stopping me from giving it a rating of was the fact that i unfortunately have seen jungle music juttering demons and fluorescent uv style give it that awful look and the script is film is more like a test to see how long you can last before giving up on it also predictable but not in a good way nothing this film does is in a good way i watched it minutes ago and thought i would rant a bit so there you are and the acting doesn't let the film down also terrible
what can possibly said about this movie other than viewer beware christmas evil should come with a warning label like cigarettes do because this was harmful to my eyes and ears i am rarely this unsatisfied with a b horror flick but this movie couldn't even bring a little scare to a five year old the point of a relentless lunatic that has a thirst for blood in a film is that should seem almost god-like like nothing can stop their maniacal rage but in this film the resident psychopath gets himself stuck in a chimney in a bizarre attempt to surprise his next victim and of course follow along with the all to popular legend of santa claus a reminder to the viewer that this man is in no way dangerous because far too stupid to be dangerous all in all a total waste of film
first off let me say that this has to be on the top of my list of boring movies nothing and i mean nothing in this movie is even remotely thrilling most of it is very confusing and as it progresses you just wish it would end some people want a movie that makes them think through the entire thing to which i power to you i on the other hand just want to be entertained which brings me back to this stinker entertainment it is not this movie is stupid and a complete waste of time seems that most here agree also most of this didn't make any sense and by the time you think you have one scene figured out another lame scene comes around i guess you see where this is going avoid this one
this movie had some great actors in it unfortunately they had forgotten how to act i was hoping the movie would get better as it went along but the acting was so robotic it was doomed from the very start it actually appeared that maybe the actors were reading from a script the whole time maybe it was the musical score or the director himself but one thing is for sure the make-up artist needs to get another job the facial powder was so thick you could see it caked on the actors faces would not recommend this movie to anyone no wonder it never hit the theaters cuba gooding jr james woods shame on you guys for not giving it your all the plot was great just needed a whole lot more
before watching this film i could already tell it was a complete copy of saw with the shack-like place they were in and the black guy wanting someone to break his hand to get out of the cuffs name on a movie would typically turn me away can we say gross but i still wanted to give it a out i was a bit interested the acting is absolutely horrible and i found myself laughing at almost each reaction from the characters the man that played sulley mjh was even worst but i continued to the ending was the biggest joke of them all i seriously sat in shock thinking that was the ending is this a thought this pile of crap was funnier than the scary movie spoofs and that is really saying something
in this day and age of incredible special movie effects this one was a sore disappointment the actors seemed stiff and uninspired as was the dialogue westerns are not common fare for hollywood so much these days but movies like silverado prove that somebody out there still knows how to make a good one considering that it is hard to conceive that anyone would go to any expense at all in releasing much less creating such a weak film as this one if you love and are looking for a good western keep looking
i'm a christian i have always been skeptical about movies made by christians however as a rule they are know-nothings when it comes to movie production i admire tbn for trying to present god and jesus in a positive and honest way on the screen however they did a hideous job of it the acting was horrible and unless one is familiar with the bible in some fashion one could not have understood what the movie was trying to get across not only was the movie terribly made but the people who made it even had some facts wrong however in this critique those facts are irrelevent and too deep to delve into in short the omega code is the absolute worst movie i have ever seen and i would not recommend it to anyone except for comic relief from the every day grind
to quote the film better not to know better still to forget best of all to be abandoned oh the ghost story with all the technical refinements of a hollywood horror film but horrifyingly bad dialogue after the first quarter of the film and you feel like you're being preached to from the as if the writers cumulative character dialogue can be summed up by bad cop tv and a jerry springer show fitting maybe for a film like the hitcher not a russia-set horror film the result is that a potentially great setting and some potentially great gore scenes go to waste and become just silly not scary or meaningful
how disney can you get preppy rich girls act like idiots buy a bunch of stuff and get taught a lesson is disney trying to send a lesson to itself that maybe while buying everything it should maybe still be human whatever the psycho-analysis this movie girls want a rich party for their rich lives but then money disappears and they have to use their riches to get the milk plant milk going to employ the workers they keep it afloat until daddy comes home and the man at the beginning who appears to be the one that takes the money is the one but the ending is dumb webcam in the cayman islands huh not worth my time ever again it is better than moving castle
these were over minutes of semi unexpected boredom first i was wondering how it is possible to produce something like that then reaching minute i was convincing myself that only a few more minutes and i lasted to the very end which i'm kinda proud of as i consider watching this movie as a great test for patience and crap tolerance was it worth watching at all well as i wrote above if you want to test yourself give it a try and if you're strong willed enough you may even last to the end the movie lacks coherence and characters seem to have no common sense at all all happenings in the movie you can be sure you saw somewhere before and they seem to be put in this movie just to fill the film reel
must admit that it isn't a good movie would never watch this movie if pacino wasn't in movie is about a strange he is and sometimes don't like the character at really minutes you may fall i don't understand why pacino wanted to be a part of this horrible because of money or i'm an avid pacino bought this movie people i you haven't bought it even think about just a waste of time
the plot is about the death of little children hopper is the one who has to investigate the killings during the movie it appears that he has some troubles with his daughter in the end the serial killer get caught it but before you find out who dunnit you have to see some terrible acting by all of the actors it is unbelievable how bad these actors are including hopper i could go on like this but that to much of a waste of my time just don't watch the movie i've warned you
this must be one of the most overrated spanish films in history its lack of subtlety and complexity and its total political correction make it really childish with only characters the world is just not like this and good movies show complex characters with opposite impulses dilemmas etc however what i hate most about this film is father the director tries to teach us a good lesson tattoo artists with shaved heads are not always bad guys in fact they can be better than the average looking dad this is like philosophy or something thank you achero i'll propose you for the nobel prize of literature
terrible movie if there is one turkish film you should avoid seeing in that should be banyo what a waste of time other than couple of cheap laughs this movie achieves nothing nada zilch nil the dialog is cheap and sexual clich√©s are all over it the director needs to watch more films before attempting to direct his own the red headed women displays examples of what an actress should not do if you are interested in learning how not to act this is a perfect example of bad acting the only good thing i can say about the movie is wait wait there is nothing good i can say about it i must have really disliked it to write about it this much jeez
how did i ever appreciate this dud of a sequel all it does is throw balls worst of all it doesn't compare to even the first installment of the series the comedy suffers from not being funny where did all the unintentional laughter go enough slapstick on-the-field action goes on too long bob uecker literally saved this one from a complete nine-inning shutout next major league return to the little league ehh could be leave this one on the shelf and plan a trip to the all-star game this had three strikes too many
this movie will promote the improvement of the mind read a book incredible anyone would think this movie deserved the time and investment to make i've seen b movies before but the c movie has just been invented i didn't think i would ever enjoy power rangers since my kids stopped watching but i found myself looking for the videos fifteen minutes into knights high school productions are better than this and the actors involved should erase this from their resume embarrassment is one of many descriptions that come to mind my roommate who loves these types of movies even turned it off now that has to really tell you something if you watch this movie and like it i will pray for you
how has this piece of crap stayed on tv this long terrible it makes me want to shoot someone so fake that it is actually worse than a sci-fi movie i'd rather have a stroke than watch this nonsense i remember watching it when it first came out i thought hey this could be interesting then i found out how absolutely insanely ridiculously stupid it really was it was so bad that i actually took out my pocket knife and stuck my hand to the people stop watching this and all other reality shows they're the trash that is jamming the networks and canceling quality programming that requires some thought to create
i have read the other comment about this movie and usually i try not to be harsh in my criticisms because i try to be a nice person however this movie is one of the worst movies that i have ever seen thats topping a lot of bad usa network plus cinemax nights whoever thought of this movie needs to be prevented from ever making another one this film disgusted me in a way that no other film ever i really think these people are insane just save your time and do not watch this fllm please i wish that i had the acting is horrible the plot plot is stupid and degrading and insane i really do not think this should have been made into a movie but that is my opinion and i am trying to save you from wasting your time
i'm a big porsche fan and the car was the best star in this the now dried up drug abusing child star of the is bland as per usual and commenting on back up from minor would be pointless needless to say they were all very average a cool movie as a trip down memory lane into the with some weird clothes some good shots of the colorado backdrop and a very harmless albeit mind numbing in all please don't waste your time watching this unless you love movies corey haim or like myself love old school porsches one in particular looks great because too short to watch crappy movies
saw this on tv i'm glad i didn't go to the cinema to see this or spend the money on rental the movie is totally predictable from the corrupt owner and planner to the snaking electric cables the plot is really weak and unbelievable the avalanche expert guy gets hit by a foot wave of bone breaking avalanche actual footage and all he has to do is get up and shake himself down the avalanche thunders down at a million miles an hour and stops dead at the side of the of the actual avalanche material is impressive and shows its devastating power but the contract between the real avalanche and the staged stuff makes this film look even yourself a favour don't bother with this one not even on
elizabeth rohm was the weakest actress of all the law and order and her acting is even worse here her attempts at a texas accent are amateurish and unrealistic nor can she adequately summon the intense emotions needed to play the mother of a kidnapped child at times while her daughter is missing she manages to sound only vaguely annoyed as if she can't remember where she left her is an important true story so too bad that the awful acting of the lead actress distracts so much from the message the rest of the cast is talented enough but they just can't overcome tendency to simply lay on a particularly thick imitation of a southern drawl whenever actual acting is required
i know i've already added a comment but i just wanted to clarify not some old fogey from the baby boom generation that grew up glued to a flickering picture of phil silvers jackie gleason was already years old before i was born but i had the pleasure of discovering phil bilko courtesy of i wonder if i would have enjoyed steve travesty if i hadn't seen or heard of phil silvers i don't know maybe i would of the other reviewers who think this movie is worthy of a admit that they haven't seen the original i can only urge you to spend minutes of your life watching a single episode if after watching the original ernie colonel hall ritzig emma duane doberman henshaw dino flashman zimmerman mullin et al you still think that steve film is woth anything above a i'll stand you a pint
this movie pretty much sucked i'm in the army and the soldiers depicted in this movie are horrible if your in the military and you see this movie you'll laugh and be upset the entire movie because of the way they acted as a squad it was ridiculous they acted like a bunch of normal people with army uniforms on not knowing what to do it was a pretty gory movie i'd have to say the least there was a couple scenes where they try to make you jump i'd recommend seeing it if you are bored and want to see a violent gory movie it will be a better movie also if your not in the military i also would have to say i liked the first one better than this one
i though this would be an okay movie since i like zombies and horror movies in general but i did not think it would be such a piece of like it was the only zombie in the movie is at the beginning and he gets ran over by a god damn car the movie looks to be written by a porn director and filled by porn actors i wouldn't ever call them actors the costumes seems to be stolen from a local school play its seems like a road movie with almost no monsters there is no fun at all in this piece of only horror but not in the way the director intended i would rather be raped by a pedophile than see this movie ever again ugh
not long enough to be feature length and not abrupt enough to a short this thing exists for one reason to have a lesbian three-way there are worse reasons to exist one sad thing is that this could have made a decent feature length movie misty fits snuggly into her outfit and is a very cocky girl and when people are so infatuated with a game character like lara croft that they make nude calenders of her you know that a soft-core flick is set to explode unfortunately this is pretty pathetic especially the painfully fake sex scene between darian and misty where you can see her hand is fingering air watch this if you just can't get enough of misty or ruby who makes a nice blonde and has zee verst jerman akcent ever
this was longer than the ten commandments all lord of the rings and the matrix trilogy combined my oh my what a nightmare this is the single biggest over-hype of there is not a moment that is not scripted and clich√©d movie musicals can be done brilliantly and bring genuine excitement to the viewer dreamgirls takes the route of chinese water torture in the form of endless music montages shoddy acting and poor directing choices mr condon did you have to do the old billboard countdown shots at no wait look its rising up the charts and here is the passing billboard notice to show you again
jean rollin artistic nonsense about vampires aliens and the quest for women are beautiful and the photography stunning the dialog is inane its a laughable mess great to look at but as any semblance of a horror film or thriller purely awful i'm trying to figure out if we're suppose to be scared or not at the same time is it a put on or not its an odd mix of art film and horror that never quite meshes and while its nice to look at it never seems to mean anything and its by no means scary even if the occasional shot or sequence creates a moment of frisson its well made pretentious twaddle something to leave on in the background as a living wall paper for those who like naked women
this movie was so terrible it was almost good almost we love musicals but not this one even with the terrible sound quality poor cinematography and many actors who can't sing or dance anthony rapp actually managed to give a good performance toward the end the character marjorie a drunk lady was enjoyable to watch too plot is very unexpected and could have been funny without terrible singing and cheezy piano music admittadly some of the songs are pretty catchy not in a good house is a funny movie to watch simply because it is awful we think it might be a good stage musical excellent actors
william hurt scuba diving scientist us agents running the investigation abroad the sick contaminated man kicking butt after falling feet on his back and running away sniper missing and not killing hurt wounding him but the second kill shot is dead on waste of time to compare this to falling down as other reviewers did is ridiculous oh and by the end of the movie they decide to start wearing gloves on their hands except for the evil agent and hurt decides to kill him by giving him the virus handshake what did imdb require lines of text i'm just babbling here doesn't this just dillute the content of reviews if you are required to have x amount of lines
a wealthy harvard dude falls for a poor radcliffe chick much to the consternation of his strict father sugary and most of all sappy story about a battle of the classes when rich-kid ryan o'neal brings home a waif of a librarian for his snobbish parents to ridicule ali macgraw is the social derelict with the filthy mouth while john marley plays her devout-catholic father but no one in the film is more annoying than o'neal himself with his whimpering portrayal as champion 8( years later by story
unfortunately this movie does no credit whatsoever to the original nicholas cage fairly wooden as far as actors go imbues the screen with a range of skill from non-plussed to over the top the supporting cast is no plot stays much the same as the original in terms of scene progression but is far worse not enough detail is given to allow the audience to by into what is being sold it turns out just a bill of poor goods disbelief cannot be suspended nor can a befit of a doubt be given the only saving aspect of this film is that it is highly visual as the medium requires and whomever scouted the location should be was much laughter in the audience and multiple boos literally at the wait for the original to come on television pour a whiskey and enjoy
after harry reems teenage girlfriend is raped by zebbedy colt night-walker reems becomes despondent and consoles himself by having sex with some lesbians meanwhile colt who carries a cane and dresses like a magician rapes some more women eventually reems decides to track him down and end his crime spree despite being shot on film and marginally nasty it looks like any other porno and is ineptly executed the scenes are surprisingly restrained and the attempt to cash in on death wish is laughable r bolla holocaust plays a cop colt who is usually over-the-top wigs out in a couple of scenes but too well behaved for my money this roughie could have been much rougher
the humor in your daddy is such poor taste that i actually closed my eyes in certain scenes close ups of semen are not funny nobody thinks they are people get nervous when they see something so gross and to hide their nervousness they laugh watching your daddy gave me a disgusting nervous feeling
please don't rent or even think about buying this don't even have it available at the red box to rent which would cost a i think its worth less than main reason why i rented this d movie was because jenna jameson is in the movie lol between will give credit that the movie had hot chicks and quite a bit of nudity but other than that you might as well buy another d horror movie that has the same thing with nobody you lynn has more acting time in this movie than jenna not even on the front cover of the movie nor her recommend people to watch zombie strippers because you see jenna almost throughout the whole movie nude most of the movie is a big disappointment such a huge waste of time
i may not have the longest of attention-spans but this is the second movie i have refused to see all the way through and i even bought it on dvd because of its classic status first i thought that the director was playing a big joke so i kept waiting for a resolution something to laugh at something to keep my interest but this resolution never came rather the writing was laughably amateurish the movie dragged on and felt disjointed like someone cut a tv series to feature-length the academy must have been on drugs when they nominated this movie for no less than eight again i repeat myself this is the second movie i have refused to watch all the way through the first was exterminator i hope this gives you an indication of how bad it really is
this is the worst movie i've ever seen i'm not kidding the next time it comes on i will just continually run my head into a wall it would me more enjoyable to sit in an emergency room trying to explain to a doctor why my brain is swollen than attempting to make it through this movie hope that black and stiller never work together on a project this bad again they are both good comedians so i was shocked this was so they had to do it all over again i'm pretty sure that they would decide to not do it the folks that fronted the money must have lost a ton not because the special effects of them were terrible
this is another example of a sucky sequel to a great movie i highly recommend the prophecy but this movie was a dud from the start the acting was decent all the way around but the story line was weak and added nothing to the origional a out of at best
the animation in this re-imagining of peter the wolf is excellent but at minutes the film is sleep inducing they should have called it peter the snails because everything moves at a pace i couldn't even watch the film in one sitting i had to watch it minutes at a time and it was pure yourself minutes do not watch this film and you will thank can only guess that the oscar nominating committee only watched the first few minutes of the nominees unfortunately to vote for the winner in the best animated short category the voters will have to sit through the whole thing i already feel sorry for them and must predict that no way this film will come close to winning
a major disappointment this was one of the best uk crime drama detective shows from the which developed the fascinating title character played by robbie coltrane however this one-off has little to add and perhaps suffers from an inevitable let down due to raised expectations when a favored show returns after a long hiatus coltrane isn't really given much to do much more attention is spent on the uninteresting killer and in what he has to act in he seems uninvolved almost bored the story is written by the books and the attempt to update us on family life seems lightweight perhaps if the writers had a whole series in front of them instead of just this one two-hour show they would have written this with much more depth as is skip this and watch the old cracker from the which is far far superior
this movie really has no beginning or end and really very unbelievable mary-k and ashley are supposed to be interns working in a mailing room for an italian fashion company but for some reason they're put up in a hotel located across the street from the coliseum and all of the other interns they work with are just as abnormally model-looking as they are one thing that i found obvious in this movie is the way that one of the twins doesn't end up with the guy i guess they tried to twist their usual plot a bit nice try
i remember this movie when i was a lot of reviews are saying the same thing age with a group of school buddies we all wanted to see billy crystal in his first movie and fell for the typical commercial ads telling us this was a great comedy we suffered through about minutes of it and all agreed to leave the theater it was grotesque tasteless and a far cry from the ability billy crystal had to make us laugh we were not laughing i stumbled upon this review by accident and decided to register just to tell the rest of the world what a rot-gut waste of film this was now if you rent this you deserve what you get you've been warned
watching it now still as skanky and sexist as i remember comes from a time when girls were dolly birds and basically playthings hard to take in that it is from the hammer studios and the fact available on dvd when good films are not our nations shame where the working class are portrayed as work shy layabouts or worse trouble is you can't help feeling nostalgic for a clippie on a bus try to hold your stomach contents when you see olive in a fluffy blue saucy nightie or something similar like shirley bassey used to wear for a concert in warning this film shows the illegal practice of towing a motorcycle combo by a red double decker bus which i've been informed is not a routemaster but a just don't bother watch something decent instead like porridge or a fly crawling up a wall
you can't really go far when the initial story isn't all that great the premise of needing blood is just script is blas√© the actors don't have much to work with the sets were staged out in the desert to cut costs a trademark that if the background is the desert then the movie has no of budget is okay if a story solarbabies and blood of champions are examples of decent work from no but this movie looks as if they had to scrape their change together just to buy the cameraman a sandwich again forgivable if only the story didn't just plain this movie commits the biggest crime of all it doesn't finish it simply ends as if a commercial break away from the rest of the movie but the rest never comes just bad
this movie was heavily marred by the presence of steven seagal or as i should say steven so-dull like before seagal is either too good or too stupid to re-dub his own lines leaving someone to impersonate his voice for the shots where the sound needed to be looped a few films before this was he has done this too but i don't think to this extent to be honest the film looks pretty good the script could use some work but parts of this film looked like a real movie of course all told this film is pretty would have been much better without seagal who has become a cartoon of himself don't bother anything over a buck for this one is too much i honestly think this is the last time for me and a seagal film taken me so long to realize this
whipped is one of the most awful films of all time it is a mean hateful piece of garbage that had me forcing myself to stay in the theater more than any other movie of besides maybe the grinch it is not as people have called it an insightful portrait of modern relationships that would be a little film called high fidelity whereas that movie was honest and sympathetic whipped is hostile cynical misanthropic cinematic poison avoid this like so many plagues unless you want to see how truly bad a comedy can get
i bought this film on dvd so i could get an episode of mystery science theater thankfully mike crow and tom servo are watchable because the film itself is not although there is a plot a story one can follow and a few actors that can act there isn't anything else the movie was so boring i have firmly confirmed that i will never watch it again without tom crow and mike as summarized above however it was better than the film featured in the episode that preceded it mitchell
after seeing the credits with only one name that i recognize and that was the preacher in this film conway i did not expect much from this film and i was not disappointed a man is planning on killing his new wife by convincing other people that she is insane and will take her own life unbeknown to the husband is that the plastic looking skull that he uses in contrast a ghost of a woman apparently his first dead wife has revenge on her mind and uses a real skull a simple plot with a twist of irony at the end if you are tired late one night and in need of sleep this will help you to sleep that sleep
for a comedic writer woody allen really lets the paying viewer down with this meager attempt at character development there are a few entertaining moments but no more than one would have listening to their dryer tumbling tennis ferrell wastes his time in this movie which fails to showcase his usually funny delivery amanda peet did well but again didn't have the room to move in this otherwise corpse like movie the movie is so heavy and dull that it cannot be carried but if it were carried radha mitchell did it you enjoy movies that go on and on in one scene and don't really accomplish anything but to show that their writer can write a few lines of snappy dialogue on occasion then you'll love this movie
i think i've seen worse films so i'm giving this a but a struggle to remember what they could have been possibly xtro dull or possibly creep plain dull but it is a struggle to think of something worse difficult to know where to start just say a poor under siege starring an even poorer jean claude van damme the only redeeming feature was seeing casper van dien i always wondered what happened to him after starship troopers yes he was johnny rico if you really want to from this site been stuck in tv movie hell casper be more selective please arghhhhh i've just turned over and a half decent film on called criminal law now i'm beginning to get really resentful about the last
wow this is the worst movie ever the only reason i signed up for imdb was so i could complain about this movie i have never walked out of a theater or stoped a dvd but i almost stopped this one i should have but i watched it all the way to the end just to get let down again with an absolutely terrible ending wow if this is all that wes craven can produce his time is long up i've never seen the first one and will never after watching this its terrible acting with a terrible plot hey looks someone is shinning a mirror at us lets go check it out and the sad part is that when this movie came to dvd it was completely checked out at blockbuster forever so i feel bad for all the people that saw this junk
this must be one of the worst swedish movies ever made is embarrassing that such a bad script was allowed to become a movie and shown in cinemas as recently as year never seen so many visible sponsored products in one and the same movie it shouldn't be that obvious can't understand why so many known actors even thought the idea to even be visible in a movie like this if i had any respect for some of the known actors in this movie before i saw the movie it is gone for sure now heard that there will be a follow up movie to this one and i can't understand how that is even possible
this show had pretty good stories but bad dialog the main character was especially annoying quite obvious why this show was canceled although like most upn shows i never knew it even existed until it was in syndicated of plots seemed to be copied from other shows and movies leading me to think the producers didn't have an original idea in their heads haven't commented enough you've got to have at least ten lines of text the special effect were not bad for a gnome was a nice character
only reason i have seen dalmatians was its nominations for original song and costume design for the oscars i must admit that i was less than impressed with this film in this sequel cruella the way glen close pulls off this role very well is released from the hospital due to her good behaviour she likes all sort of animals and locks all her furs away from that point we only wait until she starts having crises soon enough she does and tries to make the best coat of fashion world of course for herself and from fine dalmatian fur apart from glen close i found all cast quite silly but from a eye funny that is fair enough as its target market is i assume children under quite a good entertainment for children and families but didn't do much for me out of
well i just paid a dollar for a dvd of this movie and it wasn't even worth that it seems to be from a poor print and is in the public domain i am despite her glory awards and reputation is a homely british gal who can't sing or dance or of the fine old hollywood character actors on display here must have thought they were doing a classic director herbert wilcox husband always thought anna was the most exciting and talented femme on the screen he was mistaken she was improbably popular in britain before and after wwii her serious roles are even more ludicrous than her musical appearance a couple of the famous songs are included and neither one is well presented skip this one and find the one that stars doris day at least you get some real comedy and professional style dancing
pokemon is little more than three or four episodes of the tv series strung together without the usual commercials the story is typical of pokemon fighting and a resolution where all are happy in the end and there is nothing original or unusual in the animation some of the holes in the plot are filled in the closing credits without explanation and everything is just a bit too see it on the big screen the only reason is to be a part of your world both of my sons enjoy pokemon and by my showing an interest in what they like we are closer seeing a film in a theatre is still different than seeing it on the tube and my sons enjoy the full movie-going experience i gave the movie a mostly from my point of
what made me track this movie down was the viewing vampyres i thought i have to get the other movies this guy has made i was sorry i tracked this is a weak attempt at an type movie laden with sex and only ugly actors and actresses this is an excuse for sleaze the only redeeming factor was the setting and atmosphere avoid this one too much hype surrounds it not worth the effort of finding it this refers to the welcome to the grind house edition i hope he has some other movies which lives up to vampyres oh and the goat scene was very boring i understand that this is what carries the hype
you know how sometimes you can watch a crappy movie with friends and laugh at all the shortcomings of the movie well this was beyond that i bought the dvd at tower records because it was like and i'd heard this was a movie you could laugh at it is really nothing short of pathetic about minutes into the movie my friends started asking me to turn it off around minutes they begged me after an hour we compromised to fast forward to the end so we could see how the conflict was resolved because we had been watching the whole time for matt walsh seriously don't watch this movie it is beyond painful
boring fantasy that gives joan plowright star billing but little to do sappy kids pursue their dreams frankie wants to be a ballerina and a baseball player while best-friend hazel runs for totally pedestrian in every way plus the added disadvantage of syrupy performances by the girls as well as the baseball boys certainly a lesser effort for limits
there is simply no use in trying to glorify any part of this was straight up trash at the very beginning you might think that you are in for a visually stunning piece of cinematography and then shortly thereafter you are hit with a large sack of fail the fighting is barely martial the acting is teetering on the edge of par and the music is not worth describing there is only enough of a story to have created an excuse for this film to have been made the decisions that the characters make and the way that they deal with the situations is weak and did nothing but frustrate me i think that the only reason this film came about was to act as a bit of fan service by using yumiko shaku
i was willing to go with the original it went along with the plot and stayed true to the characters of one of my favorite stories however this movie was in my opinion a crummy rehash with essentially the same story line and no clear character choices i didn't honestly care what happened to any of them the strongest part of the original story liasons not ci is the characters and their interactions not the events themselves i wasn't clear until i read the imdb that this movie was meant to be a prequel especially since the title includes a number i expected a sequel but then determined that it must be a companion piece over all i must say that this movie read to me at least like a soft porn version of les liasons i was not impressed
oh i heard so much good about this movie went to see it with my best friend female i'm male now please allow me a divergent opinion from the mainstream after the first couple of dozen take off your clothes we both felt a very strange combination of silliness and boredom we laughed it not with it we dozed would have been better off staying in bed we were convinced we had spent money in vain and we had the plot was incoherent and the characters were a group of people about whom it was impossible to care a waste of money a waste of celluloid this movie doesn't even deserve one out of ten votes but the lowest available i'm not sure why this movie has the reputation that it does of being excellent i don't recommend it to anyone who has even a modicum of taste or intelligence
to reviewers the year is and the players are year-old college kids about to enter grad school jolly the synthesizer keyboard was not invented yet but there it is on the bandstand the ford pony car was not invented yet but there it is playing oldies music the synthesizer appeared to be a model from the mid the pony car at best is from the mid year-old college kids josh brolin had seen birthdays when this made-for-tv movie was plot is so predictable that viewers have plenty of spare time to think of all the errors appearing upon their
oh those italians assuming that movies about aristocrats with weird fetishes castles drowned in gothic atmosphere and back-stabbing relatives trying to get their hands on an inheritance are inherently interesting to all if you've seen one film of this type you've basically seen them all favorite screaming skull fits the mold the night evelyn came out of the grave is formulaic by-the-numbers and dull as hell even the luscious erika blanc is put to waste
not that i dislike childrens movies but this was a tearjerker with few redeeming qualities fox was the perfect voice for stuart and the rest of the talent was wasted hugh laurie can be amazingly funny but is not given the chance in this movie sugar-coated sugar and would hardly appeal to anyone over years of age see toy story monsters inc or shrek instead
